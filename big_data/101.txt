A Visual Approach for Spatio-Temporal Data Mining M-Tahar Kechadi and Michela Bertolotto School of Computer Science and Informatics University College Dublin Bel\002eld Dublin 4 Ireland Email tahar.kechadi@ucd.ie michela.bertolotto@ucd.ie Abstract In this paper we propose a system for mining very large spatio-temporal datasets The system comprises new techniques to ef\002ciently support the data-mining process address the spatial and temporal dimensions of the dataset and visualize and interpret results In particular we have developed an advanced visualization tool for 003exible and intuitive interaction with the dataset including functionality for displaying association rules and variable distributions 1 Introduction Data mining techniques can be of signi\002cant value for spatio-temporal applications Spatio-temporal data mining is a user-centric interactive process where both mining experts and domain experts work closely together to gain insight on the spatial and temporal evolution of a given phenomenon Th is process encompasses a s et of exploratory computational and interactive approaches for analyzing very large spatial and spatio-temporal datasets Within this context several challenges remain from the de\002nition of mining techniques for dealing with spatialtemporal information to the development of effective methods for interpreting and presenting the 002nal results To this aim visualization techniques are very powerful within this context since they take advantage of human abilities to perceive visual patterns and to interpret them However spatial visualization features provided in existing geographical applications are not adequate for decision-support when used alone New solutions should not only include a static graphical view of the results produced during the mining process but also the possibility to dynamically and interactively obtain different spatial and temporal views as well as interact in different ways with them This can help in discovering details and patterns that might remain hidden otherwise Within this context the main challenges remain how to visualize the spatio-temporal multidimensional dataset and how to de\002ne effective visual interfaces for viewing and manipulating the geometrical components of the spatial data To address these issues we have developed a system for exploratory spatio-temporal data mining The aim of this system is to enable data mining tools to provide some form of localization in the data being analyzed as well as to interactively visualize in 3D the outcome of the mining process thus leading to greater effectiveness and signi\002cance of the results To achieve these goals the system includes a data mining engine that can integrate different algorithms to work with speci\002c types of datasets and a 3D visualization tool The visualization tool exploits Java3D to provide advanced user interaction with the mining results Key features include the possibility to visualize both the data satisfying speci\002c mining rules and the shape of the rules extracted This allows discovering speci\002c relationships between the shape of the initial dataset and the shape of speci\002c rules i.e the characteristics of the initial dataset and all uncovered laws controlling the observed event Standard visualization tools for geo-spatial data do not provide this functionality The remainder of the paper is structured as follows Section 2 describes the main components of the proposed system Section 3 discusses related work while Section 4 provides details of our data mining approach Section 5 presents the visualization tool Section 6 is dedicated to the selected case study including a very large real world dataset and to a discussion of experimental results Finally in Section 7 we present some conclusions and ideas for future work 2 System Overview The Data Mining process usually consists of three phases 1 pre-processing or data preparation 2 modelling and validation and 3 post-processing or deployment During the 002rst phase the data may need cleaning and transformation according to possible constraints imposed by some tools algorithms or users The second phase consists of choosing 504 0-7803-9788-6/06/$20.00 ©2006 IEEE 


or building a model that better re\003ects the application behaviour Such a model should be evaluated in terms of its ef\002ciency and accuracy of its predictive results Finally the third step consists of using the selected model to effectively study the application behaviour Usually the model output requires some post-processing in order to exploit it This step can bene\002t from data visualization since interactivity and user expertise are very important in the 002nal decisionmaking and data interpretation The mining process for spatial data is more complex than for relational data in terms of both the mining ef\002ciency and the complexity of possible patterns that can be extracted from spatial datasets The reason is that the attributes of neighboring patterns may have signi\002cant in\003uence on a pattern and should also be considered Therefore new techniques are required to ef\002ciently and effectively mine spatial datasets Especially in spatial data mining the third phase is so important that some researchers incorporated most of its processes into phase two such as automatic and interactive visualization of data and called it Interactive Data Mining IDM IDM combines both automatic and visual data mining and received much attention from users as it offers higher degree of satisfaction and con\002dence The system we have developed describes the behaviour of some natural phenomena which have been monitored and recorded at several time instants It is mainly intended to deal with datasets characterized by thematic properties expressed through values of attributes that change over time  Our system relies on a standard three-tier architecture including a data store at the back end an application server and a visualization component at the front end The application server runs all application programs that perform the mining tasks The mining engine produces an output model that contains structured results In addition the application server must include domain-speci\002c wrappers that transform raw data into the input format required by the mining engine In order to interpret the output of the mining process the results of the mining process must be displayed with different visualization tools possibly providing complementary interacting functionality In this 002rst implementation we have developed a powerful application to support exploratory visual data interpretation Such an application displays the output of the mining process in a 3D virtual environment with full interactivity features allowing users to freely change their viewing perspective This tool concentrates on the exploratory analysis of the data by analyzing the internal structure of the dataset its inherent internal relationships and the patterns among data inferred by the mining algorithm 3 Related work In this section we describe our data mining approach to deal with spatio-temporal datasets We start with a review of the current state-of-the art in this 002eld and then we present our solution Numerous research projects on spatial data mining have been conducted in the last two decades Some attention has been dedicated to the application of existing as well as the development of new mechanisms to extract relevant information from large data repositories However due to the huge volume and diverse nature of this kind of data traditional techniques such as statistical methods are inadequate to elicit complex spatial and temporal relationships among data Most of the approaches used in current research projects are based on clustering and association rules 10 Clustering techniques are used to group objects based on their special parameters or some notion of distance or similarity measure In traditional clustering the similarity measure often depends on the distance between objects or their land surface types The most popular clustering technique is kmeans  Se v eral of its v ariants were also de v eloped to improve the quality of the clusters 19 14 Moreo v er  there are many other clustering techniques based on different principles including DENCLUE BIRCH 15 and Chameleon These algorithms deal only with spatial correlations and cannot be directly used for discovering temporal patterns simultaneously Furthermore they are very computationally expensive and usually trapped into local minima as they tend to concentrate on local features Association rules have been used successfully on spatial datasets They seek to discover associations among patterns encoded within the datasets The main idea is to design spatial association rules that not only can 002nd local correlations between patterns but also global ones Spatial association rules constitute an improvement over generalizationbased spatial data-mining methods as the latter cannot discover rules re\003ecting spatial pattern structures These techniques have the advantages of being very powerful using simple computations and dealing with different types of attributes simultaneously Ho we v er the y ha v e e xponential growth as the problem size increases depend highly on the model used to represent and determine the items and have dif\002culties in identifying items that only occur rarely 12 Most efforts have been spent in trying to adapt modify or improve conventional techniques relying on a solid KDD Knowledge Discovery in Database experience to design new suitable mining models As detailed in this approach usually materializes in either embedding temporal awareness in spatial systems or accommodating space into temporal data mining system Similarly in 2 an e xten505 


sion of existing OLAP systems with additional components and/or layers to treat geo-referenced data is presented Despite some good results a 003aw of this method is the lack of a clear discernment on how to consider space and time it simply manages to handle them without really exploiting their characteristics during the analysis Some good attempts have been made in proposing a more meaningful data format to highlight spatio-temporal relationships prior to elaboration this can be achieved either by pre-processing the database or by imposing a le v el of meta-data to properly access information within the whole dataset In this paper we propose a new approach for spatiotemporal data mining that consists of two main components a localiser and a miner The localiser deals with the data attributes and especially with spatial and temporal dimensions The miner processes the data based on the spatiotemporal relationships provided by the localiser By differentiating the two tasks the computations are simple and quick as they are done locally The output of the miner association rules is also fed to the localiser for further improvement Unlike conventional approaches in which the interactivity is inexistent or reduced to a minimum very few simple operations our approach is interactive as the two processes can run concurrently This approach also differs from IDM in the sense that the processes of mining/analyzing the data and visualization are quite separate as to facilitate the testing and evaluation of different algorithms and techniques involved in each individual phase 4 Spatio-temporal Data Mining Spatial datasets are more complex than conventional data This complexity is not only in processing and interpreting the data but is also present in the data mining input Spatial data is usually characterized by two different types of attributes spatial and non-spatial attributes The former type identi\002es the spatial locations of spatial items These include 3D space coordinates item shape geometry etc The latter is usually the same as in conventional datasets such as item name item key type rate size etc The main difference between these two types of attributes is that the relationships between spatial patterns/items are often implicit while they are usually explicit in non-spatial objects Usually the pre-processing phase depends directly on the technique used to mine and analyze the data For instance association rules are designed to work with categorical data Data preparation in this case consists of discretizing numeric data into ordinal categories In this study we developed a technique to categorize data based on the sampling technique described in The main difference resides in the prede\002ned goals Our technique called DataNarrower  is designed to properly categorize the variables or attribute values while the sampling technique developed in aims at reducing the database activity by analyzing a randomly chosen sample and then generalizing the result to the whole database Our technique also takes into account the fact that many variables never cover all the range of values allowed e.g after splitting the domain of a variable into 100 intervals we observe that 98 of values fall in the 002rst interval The model used here consists of mapping the spatial datasets onto a virtual partitioned space This can be seen as a layer in which original data is aggregated into virtual points partitions representing the minimal spatial unit that can be occupied by a spatio-temporal entity Each virtual point is identi\002ed by a set of attributes including coordinates size neighbourhood etc For instance traditional geographical databases have two or three dimensions while in spatio-temporal datasets the number of dimensions can range from two one spatial and one temporal dimension to N time three spatial dimensions n virtual dimensions The points are disjoint therefore any shape used to implement a virtual point should satisfy disjunctive and complement properties This model allows us to overcome problems of heterogeneity and extend the concept of items virtual points to the majority of spatio-temporal datasets In the proposed system we focus on developing a technique based on association rules to discover relationships between spatial patterns A spatial association rule is of the form A  B  s   c   where the pattern A is called antecedent and B consequent  and the percentages s and c are called the support and the con\002dence of the rule 5 The pro blem of discovering association rules consists of identifying all rules within the dataset satisfying minimum support s and con\002dence c  This usually requires a solution to the following two sub-problems 1 002nd frequent large spatial patterns 2 extract strong spatial association rules In the 002rst problem the rules should satisfy a minimum support support  s  and in the second a spatial association is said to be strong if it satis\002es a minimum con\002dence con\002dence  c  To mine spatial association rules we developed a technique based on the Apriori algorithm which is based on the rule any subset of a frequent itemset must be frequent The association rule extraction is based on the key concept of spatial itemset According to the model de\002ned above for spatio-temporal datasets each itemset is associated with a set of virtual points We say that a virtual point supports an itemset if and only if the itemset is frequent at that point Note that virtual points supporting the rule or itemset can cover more than one time step thus extending the model to include patterns with well-de\002ned time interval As the traditional Apriori algorithm has a very high computational complexity it is not suitable for very large datasets The idea is to reduce the size of the input data by presenting the algorithm only with higher spatio-temporal relationship 506 


namely virtual points Therefore by exploiting the features of spatio-temporal datasets and by reducing the size of candidate generation performed by the localiser the adapted Apriori algorithm is ef\002cient The output of the algorithm consists of frequent itemsets and strong association rules Basically two itemsets can be united if they share all the items except one A further control is needed to verify that the intersection of the sets of virtual points referred to by the two itemsets is not empty Indeed such intersection becomes the supporting area set of virtual points for the new itemset This is to ensure that each new itemset has a supporting area and an adequate number of virtual points 5 Visual Techniques for Spatial Analysis Visual Data Mining refers to methods approaches and tools for the exploration of large datasets by allowing users to directly interact with visual representations of data and dynamically modify parameters to see how they affect the visualized data This is usually achieved by means of techniques from information visualization visual perception visual metaphors diagrammatic reasoning and 3D computer graphics without requiring the decision mak ers to have knowledge on technicalities We have developed a visualization application to enable our system with various exploratory visual capabilities meant for the different actors involved in the interactive mining process Such an application relies on the Java3D library and is aimed at providing a 3D rendering of and interaction with the association rules produced by the mining algorithm Our visualization tool displays in 3D the Association Rules identi\002ed by the mining engine Rules are intended substantially as sets of items each identifying a range of values for a speci\002c variable hence displaying an item means painting an isocloud of points a 3D scatterplot with the same value The tool exploits the Arranging view visualization technique  where tw o dif ferent views are presented in separated windows and the user can arbitrarily arrange them to facilitate the comparison of data Data are shown in two canvases which can be rotated zoomed and moved to easily examine shape density and inner pits of the cloud of points The two 3D canvases can be freely resized for example one can be closed in order to allow the maximum 003exibility and customization of the visualization space The User Interface shown in Figure 1 is composed of six main panels AR-Extraction Panel used to extract the rules in XML format from the output of the mining algorithm Layer and Info Panel  used to set rendering styles and show detailed information about the rules A set of radio buttons allows the selection of the subset of points to show Items can be reloaded separately with distinct display settings grid/points Log Panel  aimed at providing some Figure 1 The graphical user interface textual output to the user general information on the execution state of the drawing and data-fetching threads Antecedent Panel  a Java3D canvas aimed at rendering the selected active antecedent of the current rule This canvas has 5 Degrees of Freedom DoF related to mouse movements and button clicks Consequent Panel  an itemset is shown through several tabbed inner panels Usually the Antecedent and Consequent panels are used complementarily to better understand and compare different layers of the visualized content Distribution Panel  used to render a variable of the dataset independently of the rules involving it It is also possible to select which timestep the data has to be fetched from e.g 23 rd timestep The application has the additional capability of drawing upon user request the shape of a rule intended as that particular region of the space where the rule is valid i.e the set of locations in which the rule hence all item involved in it are well supported This is useful both to highlight a given distribution restricted to a small area supporting the rule as well as the structure of any pattern embedded in the data and to focus the user's attention only on the subset of the dataset involved in the rule being studied This innovative feature allows for a more ef\002cient and light visualization process even when displaying millions of points Not only the content of a rule is important but also its shape from a domain-expert's point of view it might provide additional information about the behaviour of the phenomenon being studied thus being able to narrow the visualization phase only to that shape is extremely valuable in interpreting all results We ran some tests on a Pentium 4 2  8 Ghz equipped with 1 GB of RAM and an old GeForce 2 GTS video card to test the scalability of our application The visualization tool was able to easily render up to 400  000 points  200  000 per canvas without noticeable deterioration in the frame rate 507 


thus allowing the mining experts to deal with a signi\002cant amount of data 6 A Case Study Hurricane Isabel We have tested our system on the Hurricane Isabel spatio-temporal dataset produced by the Weather Research and Forecast WRF model courtesy of NCAR and the U.S National Science Foundation available at http://www.vets.ucar.edu/vg/isabeldata  This is a substantially large spatio-temporal dataset all variables are real-valued and were observed along 48 time steps once every hour for 2 days in a space having 500 002 500 002 100  25 002 106 total points Each variable in each time step is stored in a different 002le resulting in 624 002les of about 100 MB each This 002ne fragmentation allows great 003exibility in choosing different subsets of data for each mining task Since traditional PCs are not able to handle interactively such an amount of data more than 25 millions points arranged on 62  5 GBytes special techniques must be adopted to 002lter the data These are usually based on some compression or sampling approach to view portions of the data In this study we went a step further and not only provided a way to visualize subsets of the data but aimed at rendering speci\002c patterns and relationships among them In the following we show results obtained by applying the Figure 2 Rule supported by an interesting area hurricane's eye and lateral wings adapted Apriori algorithm to the Hurricane Isabel datasets and by viewing them with the Java3D tool described above We analyzed many results and report here only some of the most meaningful In our analysis we tried to discover speci\002c patterns that were either well known about hurricane data such as the existence of an area in the centre of the dataset called the eye of the hurricane or not known but of possible signi\002cance for an expert study Having thousands of locations in the entire space permits millions of possible different shapes for a rule While analyzing results the decisive attribute in the early screening has really been the area they covered rather than their content In most cases this helped to discard unimportant results The main objective in studying hurricanes is that of predicting what they are going to do in the immediate future To this aim rules providing hints about direction or strength of the hurricane are really useful A meaningful example is given by the rule presented in Figure 2 Such a rule is supported everywhere near the sea and the land but a narrow air 003ow transversal wind component penetrating the cloud reveals an interesting behaviour the direction of this stream is exactly perpendicular to that of the hurricane that at this time-step is steering north to make its landfall and proceed towards Canada This rule presents a directional in\002ltration from south-west reaching exactly the eye of the hurricane the small hole on the left The antecedent panel provides a top view where the points representing the temperature however quite uniform in the entire area are not displayed to better relate the intruder to the land mass displayed in grey All variables represent natural events each with a different and often not well de\002ned distribution Figure 3 illustrates an example the distribution of the wind variable appears almost everywhere although with very low support When using photographs to analyze a hurricane all wind components are invisible they can only be guessed by the user and thus they are not exploited in a human study on the other hand a normal mining process can detect such presence but is incapable of localizing it or taking into account its density with respect to space In this situation the method developed during this work becomes very effective it can detect only those areas reporting a suf\002cient number of points having large values for that phenomenon Actually this process of selection applies a light form of compression to the data describing the event that is much faster than punctual data mining i.e rules pointing to single points instead of small locations non-feasible in most cases 7 Conclusions  Future Work This paper describes our system for exploratory spatiotemporal data mining including a visualization tool for viewing and interacting with the results of the mining process The system offers much scope for enhancements and 508 


further developments For example we plan to add an indication of the strength of a rule in each location changing dynamically the support to obtain larger or more exact rule We will investigate modelling association rules involving different areas for the antecedent and consequent For what concerns the pre-processing step we will analyse the user of a new technique for narrowing the variable's domain in non-uniform intervals We also would like to consider additional derived values like distance from the eye of the hurricane total wind speed etc for a more extensive analysis Figure 3 The wind's East-West Component Only the area supporting this rule is shown below References  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc of the Int'l Conf on Very large Data Bases VLDB'94  Santiago Chile Sept 12-15 1994  N Andrienk o and G Andrienk o Exploratory Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Data  A Systematic Approach  Springer 2006  N Andrienk o G Andrienk o and P  Gatalsk y  Exploratory spatio-temporal visualization an analytical review Visual Languages and Computing Special Issue on Visual Data Mining  14\(6 2003  P  Buono M Costabile and F  Lisi Supporting data analysis through visualizations In Proc Workshop on Visual Data Mining  pages 67–78 Freiburg Germany Sept 4 2001  M Costabile and D Maler ba Spec ial issue on visual data mining Visual Languages and Computing  14:499–501 Dec 2003  I Dhillon and D Modha Concept decompositions for lar ge sparse text data using clustering Machine Learning  42 2001  G Hamerly and C Elkan Learning the k in k-means In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems NIPS'03  volume 17 December 9-11 2003  G Karypis E.-H Han and V  K umar  Chameleon Hierar chical clustering using dynamic modeling IEEE Computer  32\(8 1999  D K eim C P anse and M S ips V isual data mining in lar ge geospatial poin sets IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications  24\(5 Sept/Oct 2004  K K operski J Adhikary  and J Han Spatial data mining Progress and challenges In Proc of the ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Research Issues on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  pages 55–70 Montreal Canada 1996  W  Lu J Han and B Ooi Disco v e ry of general kno wledge in large spatial databases In Proc of Far East Workshop on Geographic Information Systems FEGIS'93  pages 275 289 Singapore June 1993  J Mennis and J Liu Mining association rules in spatiotemporal data In Proc of the 7th International Conference on GeoComputation  Southampton UK Sept 8-10 2003  S Orlando P  P almerini and R Pere go Enhancing the apriori algorithm for frequent set counting In Springer editor Proc of 3rd Int Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery DaWaK'01  volume 2114 of LNCS pages 71 82 Munich Germany 2001  D Pelle g and A Moore X-means Extending k-means with ef\002cient estimation of the number of clusters In 17th Int'l Conf on machine Learning ICML'00  pages 727 734 Stanford University CA USA June 29-July 2 2000  D Peuquet It s about time a conceptual frame w ork for the representation of temporal dynamics in geographic information systems Annals of the Association of American Geographers  84\(3 1994  M Spenk e and C Beilk en V isual interacti v e data mining with infozoom  the 002nancial data set In 3 rd European Conf on Principles and practice of Knowledge Discovery in databases  Prague Czech Rep Sept 15-18 1999  H T oi v onen Sampling lar ge databases for association rules In Proc of the International Very Large Database Conference  pages 134–145 Bombay India Sept 3-6 1996  Y  Y ang and G W ebb  A comparati v e study of discretization methods for naive-bayes classi\002ers In Proc of the Paci\002c Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop PKAW'02  pages 159–173 Tokyo Japan August 18-19 2002  B Zhang M Hsu and U Dayal K-harmonic means—a spatial clustering algorithm with boosting In 1st Int'l Workshop on Temporal Spatial and Sptio-temporal Data Mining TSDM'00  2000  T  Zhang R  Ramakrishnan and M Li vn y  Birch An ef\002cient data clustering method for very large databases In ACM SIGMOD Conf  Montreal Canada June 4-6 1996  Z Zhang Y  Lu and B Zhang An ef fecti v e partitioningcombining algorithm for discovering quantitative association rules In Proc of the 1st Paci\002c Asia Conf on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  pages 241–251 Singapore Feb 1997 509

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
