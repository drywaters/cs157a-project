L The likelihood surface, L , for the bi-modal feature estimation error is shown in Figure 8.  The main peak extending around the ff i a i=A B  line is the likelihood surface resulting from a Gaussian assumption as presented in Section 3.  By allowing the a priori estimate of the feature to deviate from this assumption, two additional areas provide high likelihood estimates corresponding to when sensor A measures twice or half of the value as sensor B When a Gaussian prior is used to form the likelihoods, these measured feature pairs would lead to a low likelihood due to their relatively large distances in feature space Ai f B a\(i  f Log10\(Aif,Ba\(i   0 10 20 30 40 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0  Figure 8  Likelihood surface for the given feature estimate distribution 5. NON-GAUSSIAN FA-GNPM IMPLEMENTATION Only unbiased feature measurements which are independent from their metric states will be considered, allowing the metric and feature likelihoods to be calculated independently without loss of generality 6 The scenario generation node constructs state vectors and covariance matrices from sensor measurements.  Once they are passed to the metric/feature fusion node, feature information is stripped and only metric data is passed to an algorithm, known as GNPP, that solves instances of the GNPM problem. For our scenarios, GNPP returns NBEST association hypotheses, bias estimates and log-likelihood ratios, where NBEST is the maximum number of possible association hypotheses for the problem of interest.  GNPP returns an association matrix a of dimension \(NBEST  nA along with their corresponding log-likelihood ratios.  The metric/feature likelihood fusion node will send all possible association hypotheses \(the matrix a corresponding log-likelihood ratios for metric states LLRm f jB , for all , ,1 Ai n  and , ,1 Bj n  to the feature likelihood computation engine.  As an input this node takes the precomputed likelihood surface L , based on a priori 


computed likelihood surface L , based on a priori information of feature measurement errors.  Feature loglikelihoods LLf, are computed for the NBEST association hypotheses where the metric/feature likelihood computation engine forms a complete log-likelihood ratio based on both metric and feature data and the hypothesis with the best score is returned for performance evaluation 6. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS The framework in Section 5 was implemented and the likelihoods shown in Figure 5 were used to evaluate performance.  First, the two metric scenes from Section 4 are considered.  Figure 9 shows performance of the nonGaussian prototype compared to metric and Gaussian FAGNPM formulations  Figure 9  Performance improvement of Non-Gaussian FA-GNPM for a dense metric scene  Figure 10 - Performance improvement of Non-Gaussian FA-GNPM for a dispersed metric scene The results here indicate that an improvement over the previously presented Gaussian FA-GNPM result can be achieved when the feature measurement error is characterized correctly.  For the dense metric scene a performance improvement from 0.31 to 0.89 is obtained This is significantly greater than the Gaussian FA-GNPP result with the optimal choice of error variance producing a PCA equal to 0.51.  Likewise, for the dispersed metric scene \(Figure 10 FA-GNPP does not lead to association performance below GNPP 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 180 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 NN/1 PC A PCA for Tracks in Common   1 overlap 2 overlap 3 overlap 4 overlap 5 overlap  Figure 11 - Performance improvement of Non-Gaussian FA-GNPM \(dotted solid feature measurement error The analysis is continued for the 5 on 5 metric scene over all possible track overlaps and nearest neighbor Mahalanobis distances ranging from 0.5 to 20 \(Figure 11 The results verify that with accurate characterization of feature measurement error, Non-Gaussian FA-GNPM performs well above GNPM for a wide range of scene densities and common tracks between the two sensors 7 7. SUMMARY The results in Section 6 indicate that when feature estimation error is well understood, non-Gaussian FAGNPM shows a significant performance improvement over metric only GNPM.  The alternate approach of attempting to characterize non-Gaussian feature measurement error 


distributions with a single Gaussian produces small performance gains over metric only GNPM for complex feature measurement errors.  Conversely, even as the quality of the a priori estimate of the feature measurement distribution degrades with non-Gaussian FA-GNPM performance is well above metric only GNPM These preliminary results are an initial step towards achieving performance improvement of track-to-track correlation for a handover scenario by augmenting metric data with feature measurements.  Synthetic data was used to demonstrate a proof-of-concept capability.  Issues such as how well features can be extracted from a closely spaced object scene were not addressed here.  Future plans include utilizing measured data to further explore the problem.  In this paper, we have shown improvement when accurate knowledge of the estimation error is present.  Techniques to mitigate the effect from incorrect feature measurement error characterization need to be further studied to be effective in a fielded system REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and H.
