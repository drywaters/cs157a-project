Apriori-based high-rise intelligent form selection is established. Finally, examples of this method are presented This method provides a new approach to mining knowledge information in engineering cases, guiding structural form selection design and to improving quality, efficiency and intelligence level of structural design 
 1.  Introduction  With growing investment in high-rise buildings as well as gain in their height, scale and optional forms, increase ensuingly not only knowledge and information resources needed but also complexity in structural form selection, so do difficulty and risk. Form selection is highly intelligent 
  
experience-oriented and subjective. intelligent form selection IFS\ is an important direction in structural form selection design and knowledge acquirement is the \223bottleneck\224 of it At present, numberless high-rise buildings have been constructed and such building is still going on and on the increase. Every engineering case contains information such as knowledge, strategy and experience utilized by men in optimization of structural form selection. This sea of information undoubtedly plays an important role of reference and guidance in IFS design. Therefore, to study so as to establish a method capable of acquiring useful knowledge 
information from the existing high-rise structure cases will be of theoretical significance and practical value in tapping engineering case resources and in solving the \223bottleneck\224 problem of knowledge acquirement in IFS. In recent years we\222ve set up the decision-tree-based knowledge discovery method and the GA-based one 1-4 The former has high precision requirements for data, incapable of excluding the attributes with smaller support while the latter can describe only the general tendency, instead of a direct result, of a large number of engineering cases.  In this paper we will present, in 
combination of structural form selection characteristics, a knowledge discovery method of IFS on the basis of improved Apriori. It has been proved that this method can freely control and choose quality as well as quantity of both ant ecedent and consequent of a mining rule by setting a support value and a confidence value  2. Association Type of Apriori about Knowledge Discovery 2.1.  Definition of Association Rules  Association rule is the rule that denotes associational relationships between a group of objects in a database. Let I={i 1 i 2 205,i m 
be an itemset and D a transaction database Every transaction T is an item subset \(T 
001 I\ith a sole identifier. Association rule is a formula like X Y, where X 
002 T Y 002 T and X Y X is called antecedent and Y consequent, which means \223If X is satisfied, so is Y.\224 The rule satisfying both min sup and minimum confidence at the same time is called strong rule. An itemset containing k items is called k-itemset, indicating that the length of this itemset is k If the itemset meets the requirement of minimum support, it is 
called frequent itemset, whose set is usually noted as L k  2.2. Evaluation Indexes and Meaning of Association Rule   The indexes to evaluate an association rule are: support confidence, expected and lift Confidence is a measurement of accuracy degree of an association rule while support is a measurement of importance of an association rule. The bigger the support is, the bigger is the quantity of data on which the association rule depends, the less likely that this kind of data appear by chance, the more likely that the relational information provided by the association rule represents some rule and thus is more 
valuable. Some association rules have high confidence, but their supports are very low. This indicates these rules support less data. The reason for it is either the collected data is not enough or this kind of data may belong to a different type in the system and should be utilized according to different circumstances Expected describes the support of Y in itself without X\222s function.  Lift depicts how much the influence of X is on Y 


002 A B C} 3 BE} 2 BE} 2 B} 2 The bigger it is, the more Y is influenced by X. Generally speaking, the lift of a useful association rule should be greater than 1. Only when the confidence of an association rule is greater than the expected, can it prove that X plays a helpful or promotive role to Y. It also proves that there is some relativity between them. If lift is not greater than 1, this association rule does not have any meaning  2.3.    Apriori about Association Rule Mining Itemset Count A} 3 CE} 2 CE} 2 C} 3 D} 1 E} 3  Apriori is made up of two steps: to generate C k set of itemset candidates and to take count of them  The process of the first step can still be subdivided into two steps: join step join L k-1 to L k-1 prune step: delete unnecessary itemsets. For instance, L 3 I1, I2, I3}, {I1,I2,I4}, {I1,I3,I4}, {I1,I3,I5 I2,I3,I4}}, through joining, we get C 4 I1,I2,I3,I4}, {I1, I3 I4, I5}}. Because {I1,I4,I5} is not included in L 3 I1,I3,I4,I5 should be pruned from the set of itemset candidates C 4 Now taking the database in Table 1 for example, we shall explain the working process of the Apriori From Table 1 we know: First, initialize C 1 as the set of all items, take count of elements in it and put in L 1 elements satisfying the minimum support. Next, generate C 2 using L 1 and then take count of set C 2 to  get L 2 When we get L 3 C 4 is empty and this arithmetic comes to an end min_support=2   Table 1.  Database D  2.4.    Examples of Apriori  Tid Items 100 ACD   The second sub-question of association rule mining is to generate the association rule using the frequent itemsets found in D. To every frequent itemset A, we get all non-empty subsets B  B   ItemsetCount B 2  Itemset Count  AB  1  Itemset Count  Fig. 1. Process of getting set of itemset candidates and frequent itemsets with Apriori  3.  Improvement of Apriori  3.1.    Defects of Traditional Aprior C 1 C 2  L 2  C 3  L 3  i  To ascertain frequent itemset L k traditional Apriori needs to join L k-1 to itself to generate all the new k-itemset candidates C k the superset of L k By scanning database and calculating the support of every itemset candidate in C k we can simply ascertain L k However, when we use this method to do the data mining work of some attribute values of high-rise structure cases, we will encounter the problem of unn ecessary increase in joining items, which makes both the number of itemsets in C k  and  L k and calculation work increase, influencing efficiency and quality of the Apriori. Obviously, traditional Apriori arithmetic is not able to solve the KD problem of high-rising structure form selection efficiently. Therefore, according to attributes characteristics of engineering cases and the requirement of structural form selection as well we will make some necessary amendments of it as follows  3.2.

Apriori is the most basic method to search and generate frequent itemsets 5 almost the core of all frequentitemset-discovering arithmetics 6 7 Apriori is an arithmetic of width priority. It accomplishes mining all the frequent itemsets by repeating the searching work in order. This method is : to generate k 1\-itemset with k itemset, namely through the first scanning of D, calculate the support of each single item in every record I in D to generate frequent 1 itemset which is to be noted as L 1 then in the k time of scanning, to generate the set of all new itemset candidates using the set L k-1 of all frequent itemsets discovered in the preceding scanning and to note it as C k to scan Database D and calculate support of these itemset candidates; finally, keep all the itemsets with supports greater than minimum support to form the set of frequent itemsets with length of k and is noted as L k to repeat the above process until there is no new frequent itemset to be found    212  212 1 


add c to C2 In the process of knowledge discovery of IFS, people usually hope to know the hidden intrinsic association between structure forms and such continuous, discrete or enumerating type of attributes as height, number of floors and site class etc.. Here, if we use a single concrete attribute like height or number of floors to do the above-mentioned rule mining work it is obviously neither necessary nor practical. To this, people usually solve this problem by subdividing the abovementioned attributes into some sub-attributes having some intervals. But these sub-attributes are usually mutually exclusive. If we do the joining work with traditional Apriori we need to use both the sub-attributes and the other attributes all as 1-itemset candidates C 1 On this basis of it, we ascertain L 1 through carrying out self-joining of L k-1 and L k-1 ascertain  C k and consequently ascertain L k Obviously, when we use this method to do the joining work, calculation work of the subsequent calculating process increases due to reckoning without the mutual exclusiveness of all the decomposed attributes, which results in low efficiency. Therefore I1 I2 Table 2.  Interval division of overground floor  D L1 L1 then considering the semantic mutually exclusive relationship  between the data whose attributes is decomposed and transformed,  and using conditionally selective joining strategy L k-1 does self-joining at the generation time of itemset candidate C k Through filtration of this restrictive condition the number of itemsets likely to generate is greatly reduced and so is the number of frequent itemsets, speeding up the work of this arithmetic. For instance, to Set L 1 containing six frequent 1-itemsets A 1   A 2   A 3   B 1   B 2 and  B 3 where A i and B j  i  j 1,2,3\ are 3 sub-items transformed from the original A and B, if we use traditional Apriori to do self-joining of L 1 we will get as many as 5 is the set of frequent 1-itemset return C2  327 4 327 3=9 itemset candidates at most. Therefore, the improved arithmetic has apparent advantage. Obversely comparing with the traditional Apriori arithmetic, the improved  arithmetic has more superiority with less calculation, fast speed and high efficiency in processing the KD problem of high-rising structure form selection The pseudocode to generate C 2 set of 2-itemset candidates of the improved Apriori, is given as follows 005 005 004 327 3 327 2 327 1=120 itemset candidates while with the improved Apriori we will just get 3 l1 l2 if   returns to the subcluster on the left of character \223_\224in Item where Function find_frequent_1-itemsets   Table 4 is the interval division of some attributes when they are transformed into Boolean attributes. Attributes in Group 2 are main structure form and performance. Considering the fact that the values of these two types of attributes share some synonyms and parasynonyms, we adopt standardized method about value domain and get typical values of the thesaurus of main structure form and performance as follows: frame shearing, tube, frame+shearing, frame+tube, tube in tube complex; office premises, residence, hotel and complex. With the typical values we can do the Boolean attribute transformation work. Values of each attribute in Group 3 are simpler, which can be transformed into Boolean attributes directly. Table 2 presents the interval division and classification when some attributes are transformed into the Boolean ones  205 \205 205 \205 \205 205 205 \205\205   LEFTSTR LEFTSTR Ii Ii c LEFTSTR  overground floor  8-11 overground floor 1114 overgroun L1   // Decompose Set l2, we get Item I2 join step: generate candidates  The second and third steps in the above arithmetic are basically consistent with Boolean association-rule-mining arithmetic. Next, we introduce the first step alone.  In light of the characteristics of the attributes, we divide them into three groups. Group 1: height of the main building, overground floor, length-to-width ratio, height-to-width ratio, the maximum wind pressure. Group 2: main structure form and performance. Group 3: fortification intensity and site class The values of each attribute in the first group are concrete data which are divided in equidistance after they have been discussed and proved by experts. Meanwhile, the system provides their default values: height of the main building-10 m\ overground floor-3, length-to-width ratio: 0.05, height-towidth ratio: 0.05, the maximum wind pressure-500 L1  //  Decompose Set l1, we get Item I1       4. Rule Mining of Form Selection Based on Improved Apriori   4.1. Attribute Characteristics of High-Rise Structures and Steps of Association Rule Mining   We can solve the problem of quantitative association rule based on quantitative and discrete attributes by contrasting it to the Boolean association rule problem. In the high-rise structural case library, engineering experts suggest mining data of attributes such as height of the main building overground floor, length-to-width ratio, height-to-width ratio the maximum wind pressure, performance, fortification intensity, site class, main structure form and so on. Due to complexity of projects, these attributes vary in value type and have big value range, so it is necessary to divide them first and then parallel them to the Boolean attributes. Mining association rule can be solved in three steps: Step 1, to ascertain the interval division of value domain of every quantitative attribute. Step 2, to mine all the frequent itemsets Step 3, to form association rule from the frequent itemsets we got  4.2.

The following is part of the strong rules and explanation about them we acquired.\(1\erformance_residence=>main structure form shearing: support 7.6% ,confidence 50.3%, expected 10.5 Experts\222 explanation: The percentage that projects whose performance is residence and main structure form is shearing take up in all projects is 7.6%; among all the projects whose performance is residence, 50.3% of them have shearing as their main structure form; projects whose main structure form is shearing constitute 10.5% of all the projects 2\ Floor_18~24, function_residence, fortification intensity_7=> main structure form_shearing: support 4.8 confidence 80.0%, expected 10.5%, lift 7.6 3\ain building height_40.0~60.0, floor_12~18 function_residence, fortification intensity_7=> main structure form-shearing: support 3.7%  confidence 56.1% expected 10.5%, lift 5.3 It is clear that the above-mentioned rule about generating structure form is of great reference value for guiding form selection design 205 \205 \205 205 \205 205 205 205 \205 205 \205 205 205 205 \205 205 \205 205 \205  5.    Conclusion  This paper presents definition and evaluation indexes of association rule and analyzes the meaning of the indexes Next, in combination of characteristics of high-rise structural form selection, this paper analyzes the weaknesses of Aprior and makes improvement of it, on the basis of which, a knowledge discovery method of high-rise IFS is established Finally, it provides several examples of the method. They show: \037It can effectively acquire the desired structural form selection knowledge from engineering cases. \037 It can make full use of information in the existing cases. \037It can solve the 223bottleneck\224 problem of knowledge acquirement about intelligent form optimization of high-rise structures all right. It  In the high-rise structural case library, customers or residents are more concerned about association between main structure forms and other attributes and its degree. This demands we mine only limited data instead of all. Therefore we, on the basis of original case library, choose part of the fields to build the simplified Database D for data mining Attributes in it are shown in Table 3. On the basis of it, mining of quantitative association rule will be done  4.4.    Booleanization of Database Attributes   The attributes in Table 3 can be transformed into Boolean ones according to the ascertained attribute class and value domain interval. The transformation is shown as in Table 4 From which we can see that all the quantitative attributes are decomposed into Boolean ones and the original one corresponds to several attributes. Now that all the attributes have become the Boolean type, the problem of mining quantitative rule is changed into mining Boolean association rule. To run in the database as shown in Table 4 the arithmetic of mining Boolean association rule comes out accomplishing mining of all the association rules  4.5.

some are best for dense type datasets Currently there is no single algorithm exist that shows global best performance on all types of datasets The main limitation of previous algorithms is that they really upon only single strategy and do no combine the best features of multiple strategies for speedup the process of itemset mining In this paper we show that combining the best features of multiple strategies into a single hybrid is more beneficial and efficient than relying upon single strategy Our different experimental results on benchmark datasets show that mining all and maximal frequent itemsets using our hybrid approach is more efficient than existing algorithms and gives global best performance 13 T Uno M Kiyomi H Arimura LCM ver 3 Collaboration of Array Bitmap and Prefix Tree for Frequent Itemset Mining In 1st Int'l Workshop on Open Source Data Mining in conjunction with SIGKDD2005 2005 14 M J Zaki and C Hsiao Charm An efficient algorithm for closed association rule mining In Technical Report 99-10 Computer Science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1999 8 References 1 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc ACMSIGMOD Int'l Conf Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc Int'l Conf Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499 Sept 1994 3 S Bashir A Rauf Baig HybridMiner Mining Maximal Frequent Itemsets using Hybrid Database Representation Appraoch In Proc of 10th IEEE-INMIC conference Karachi Pakistan 2005 4 D Burdick M Calimlim and J Gehrke Mafia A maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transactional databases In Proc ofICDE Conf pp 443-452 2001 5 Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations B Goethals and M.J Zaki eds CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 http:HCEURWS.org/Vol-90 6 K Gouda and M J Zaki Efficiently mining maximal frequent itemsets In ICDM pp 163-170 2001 7 G Grahne and J Zhu Efficiently Using Prefix-trees in Mining Frequent Itemsets In Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2003 8 J Han J Pei and Y Yin Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation In SIGMOD pages 1-12 2000 9 J Liu Y Pan K Wang and J Han Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection In Proc of KDD Conf 2002 10 G Liu H Lu Y Xu and J X Yu Ascending frequency ordered prefix-tree Efficient mining of frequent patterns In DASFAA 2003 11 J Pei J Han H Lu S Nishio S Tang and D Yang HMine Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases In Proc of ICDMConf pp 441.448 2001 12 A Pietracaprina and D Zandolin Mining Frequent Itemsets Using Patricia Tries Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 243 


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
