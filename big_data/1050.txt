Prefetching XML Data with Abstract Query Mining Vincent T. Y. Ng, Chan Chi Kong and Shiu Hin Wang Department of Computing The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong cstyng@comp.polyu.edu.hk Abstract Web applications using the XML technologies are increasingly popular. Besides caching, another query performance improvement approach is prefetching Similar to other database queries, XML queries often have their own query patterns. In this paper, we present a pre-processing algorithm that 
extracts abstract queries from similar query constru cts but with different constraints values. These abstract queries help to produce useful access patterns by applying association mining on them.  Through our pre liminary experiments, we found that our prefetching approach  improved both the cache hit ratio and precision of the XML cache system 1.  Introduction One of the techniques commonly used in prefetching web pages is association rule [5 of ru les is ex tracted  from past queries history which serves as a model of a user's surfing habit. For such ru le extraction task, which is also known as web-mining, it is important that the order of 
the user's click stream is observed during the mining process. However, the concept is not that much different from regular association rules problems Various work has been done to enhance the efficiency in caching of XML-related web queries  containment problem of XQuery is studied in order to maximize the usage of the XQuery cache. In que ry  results are fragmented and stored as individual XPaths, so that a more efficient replacement strategy can be used Comparing with XML caching however, the idea of prefetching is less well studied than the HTML webpages case. In this paper, we present an approach to support 
prefetching of XML queries. We focus on client side caches, with the goal of reducing network delay time. The queries are assumed to be XQuery or XPath statements generated by client-side web applications.  We mined two types of rules from a query history log specific rules where the queries are treated \215as is\216 and are similar to webpage prefetching rules; and abstract rules which capture the generic patterns of user actions. We identified five possible cases of user query pattern s, and presented data-mining procedures for extracting rules from two of 
the cases that make prefetching possible 2 Predicting XML queries Association rules algorithms have been proven to be useful in web page prefetching [3 recom m ender system s [6  and user In these applications, queries histories containing web document access sequence are analyzed in order to cons truct rules of the form p 1 p 2 p 2 p k-1 p k where each p i represents a page, or more accurately, an 
URL, within the access sequence. Resulting rules that exceed certain confidence and support will serve as a user model for predicting future queries Consider the simple two session s of XPath history log in Figure 1. There are basically two different queries: one requesting the PERSONA of a play, the other retrieving the TITLE of each ACT of a given play. Note that, both queries contain a TITLE conditional clause whose value is not fixed over subsequence query instances SESSION 1 1 2 3 4 
SESSION 2 1 2 3 4 Figure 1. Sample queries Hence, it is desirable to obtain two types of rules from the log. The first type treats the entries as exact units. For the case in Figure 1, one specific rule is resulted PLAY[TITLE='Venice']/PERSONA PLAY[TITLE='Venice']/ACT/TITLE Depending on the query characteristics, such specific rule could be useful at times. However, in Figure 1, it is obviously more desirable to have an abstract rule that can handle the different values for the same XPath constraints in more flexible manner, i.e., It is better to have 
PLAY[TITLE=c1]/PERSONA PLAY[TITLE=c1]/ACT/TITLE where the value of c1 will be substituted at runtime Ideally, abstract rules are to represent the patterns that exist in users\220 query habit. Though, depending on the nature the desired rule, this is not always possible.  In the current work, each query  \(XQuery or XPath X is mapped Proceedings of the International Conference on Info rmation Technology: Coding and Computing \(ITCC\22204 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00 \251 2004 IEEE 


into a query template Q i and a set of constraint values C i contained in the query. For example, the XQuery below  X 215for $x in bank[bankcode=\220 015 220]/account   let $a := $x/@account-num   where $x/type = \217checking\220   return <ac-num> $a </ac-num>\216 would be mapped into the query template Q 215for $x in bank[bankcode value1 account  let $a := $x/@account-num  where $x/type value2  return <ac-num> $a </ac-num>\216 and the set of constraint values C 217015\220, \217checking\220 With this idea, the rules from the query templates and their associated set of constraints form the abstract rules that represent user querying behavi our. Here, a query pattern of the form X 1 X 2  where X 1 X 2 are web queries, can be re-written as Q 1 C 1 Q 2 C 2  Each Q i and   C i is a query template and the set of constraints in X respectively. By separating the set of constraints from the exact query, we see there are five cases to be considered 000x Case 1 C 1 Empty Set and C 2 Empty Set Example PLAY/PERSONA PLAY/ACT/TITLE 000x Case 2 C 1 C 2 Example PLAY[TITLE=\220Hamlet\220]/PERSONA PLAY[TITLE=\220Hamlet\220]/ACT/TITLE 000x Case 3 C 2 000\215 C 1 Example PLAY[TITLE=\220Hamlet\220]/ACT[.=\220Act II\220]//SCENE PLAY[TITLE=\220Hamlet\220]/ACT/TITLE 000x Case 4 C 1 000\215 C 2 Example PLAY[TITLE=\220Hamlet\220]/ACT/SCENE  PLAY[TITLE=\220Hamlet\220]/ACT[.=\220Act II\220]/TITLE 000x Case 5 C 1 000\214 C 2 and C 2 000\214 C 1 Example PLAY[TITLE=\220Hamlet\220]/ACT/SCENE[.=\220 Act II\220  PLAY[TITLE=\220Hamlet\220]/ACT[.=\220Act IV\220]/TITLE In case 1, both the antecedent and consequence contain no constraint value. This type of rules can be found by using the same technique as in web page prefetching. Case 4 and case 5 are both having a constraint that is not found in the antecedent. Since there is no easy way for deducing that additional constraint value based on the antecedent, these two cases are not considered when generating the abstract rules. However it might still be possible to have case-specific rules. Case 2 and case 3 are both suitable candidates for abstract rules mining In this paper the extraction of case 2 abstract rules from user query log is presented, although the work can be easily extended to the case 3 rules as well 3 Query Log Pre-processing In our work, it is assumed th at a user activity log is already segmented into sessions. Before mining, the segmented query logs are pre-processed by an algorithm as shown in Figure 2. The idea is that for each session in the log instead of mapping each user session into one transaction multiple transactions are created This is done by first grouping the entries that share the same constraint values into virtual sessions, and th en replacing the actual query with query templates. Each virtual session, as well as the original session, will form one separate transaction Formally, given a session S of queries, S = {x 1 x 2 203x n  virtual sessions set VS = {vs 1 vs 2 203vs m are formed where each vs i is a  virtual session of the form q i1 c i1  q is c is where each q ij corresponds to the template of a query in S and c ij is its set of constraints, such that for each two couples \(q ii c ii nd \(q ij c ij vs i we have c ii c ij The required transactions to be fed into data mining engine for abstract ru les mining is then defined as vs 1 220, vs 2 220\203vs m 220} where each vs i 220 = {q i1 q i2 203, q is is the template-only version of a virtual session Let X be an XML Query in user query history Let C\(X Let Q\(X\ the corresponding query template of X Let VS i be a set of virtual sessions, where each entry in VS i consists of \(xp,cons where xp is a query template, cons is a set of constraint in the original query For each session S i VS i initially empty set of virtual sessions For each entries x in S i If C\(x Modify x by replacing each constraint values in x by symbolic variables obtaining a query template q If there exists a virtual session v in VS i such that for each  \(vx, vc tuple in v, vc = C\(x add a new tuple \(Q\(x x else create a new virtual session v add a new tuple \(Q\(x x add v to VS i Create a transaction for each virtual session v in VS Figure 2. Pre-processing Algorithm The process is illustrated in Figure 3. In this example, the pre-processing algorithm creates three additional virtual sessions for the original session number 1, and one virtual session for the original session number 2, all according to the constraint values contained in the queries. The constraint values are included in each virtual session as Proceedings of the International Conference on Info rmation Technology: Coding and Computing \(ITCC\22204 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00 \251 2004 IEEE 


identification aids to the grouping process only, and will be discarded after the grouping is done. Thus, the pre-processed tran sactions to be submi tted to association mining engine will contain the six sessions as shown the Figure 4 Original Session 1 1  //PLAY[TITLE='Venice']/PERSONA 2  //PLAY[TITLE='Venice']/ACT/TITLE 3  //PLAY[TITLE='Hamlet']/PERSONA 4  //PLAY[TITLE='Hamlet']/ACT/TITLE 5  //PLAY[TITLE='King Lear']/ACT/TITLE Original Session 2 1  //PLAY[TITLE='Venice']/PERSONA 2  //PLAY[TITLE='Venice']/ACT/TITLE Virtual session 1.1 1 \(//PLAY[TITLE=c1]/PERSONA,{'Venice 2 \(//PLAY[TITLE=c1]/ACT/TITLE',{'Venice Virtual session 1.2 1  \(//PLAY[TITLE=c1]/PERSONA,{'Hamlet 2  \(//PLAY[TITLE=c1]/ACT/TITLE,{'Hamlet Virtual session  1.3 1\(//PLAY[TITLE=c1]/ACT/TITLE,{'King Lear Virtual session  2.1 1  \(//PLAY[TITLE=c1]/PERSONA,{'Venice 2  \(//PLAY[TITLE=c1]/ACT/TITLE',{'Venice Figure 3.

In general, it is expected the abstract rules would occur much more frequently and more useful than specific ones 4 Rules extraction The pre-processed result is sen t for sequential association rule \(SAR\ mining which has been proven to be useful in web page prefetching. For XM L queries issued by web applications, however, it is not i mmediately obvious that it is also the case, since the html links structures do not necessarily exist here. For this reason we adopted both the standard Apriori algorithm an d SAR in our study and the results are compared During the mining, the antecedents are assumed to be immediately followed by the consequences. The SAR engine we used extract all rules of antecedent of length 2 and consequence of length 1 that exceed some parameter controlled support and confidence value. Here the support is defined as the number of transactions that contain a pattern divided by the total number of transactions. For mining of specific rules, only the original transactions are counted in the denominator, whereas for abstract rules, we count both the original and the ones that are generated from virtual sessi ons during pre-processing 5 An XML caching system with prefetching The association mining is done as an offline process, with the resultant rules outputted to a file that is referenced by the XML caching system as shown in figure 5 Figure 5  XMLCaching System with Prefetching In the system shown in Figure 5, the Prefetch process reads the access log which is maintained by the client application, and matches the entries inside against the rule file produced offline during the data mining process. In our experiments, the Prefetch process is activated after each time an XML query is made by the client applications. It has been assumed that there is sufficient inter-query time interval for allowing prefetching operations. If not true this process can be performed as a low pr iority background task. Among the rules that are matching, the one with the Proceedings of the International Conference on Info rmation Technology: Coding and Computing \(ITCC\22204 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00 \251 2004 IEEE 


highest confidence is selected, and the corres ponding consequence query is prefetched and pre-stored in cache 6 Experiments The XML caching system and a client application is built using Java 1.3.  In the experiments we tried different XPath queries with two XML datasets available in the web Plays 8  Medline 9  F o r bot h Plays and Medlines  three sets of queries data, with size ranging from 535 to 667 queries, for the purpose of training, testing and evaluation, respectively, are generated In the experimental setup, the query patterns are assumed to follow a Markov model, with each node in the model representing a query template. The user\220s habit is thus modelled by the probabilities of the flows between the query template nodes. The data are assumed to exist in sessions where the session lengths are assumed to be normally di stributed In the experiments, the Plays queries and the Medlines queries have different characteristic. The Plays queries tend to contain more sequential patterns involving different query templates \(i.e, there are more acyclic paths in the data generation model\the Medline logs, where related keywords tend to appear in adjacent queries in no particular order in real life, the same query template tends to repeat several times for related constraint values. It is represented by self-looping in the model We tested four caching options in our study. The experiment is repeated using persistent cache, where the cache contents survive from one session to the next, and hing on two basic cache replacement strategies, Least Recently Used LRU\ntly Used \(LFU\also studied The results are shown is Figure 7 to Figure 12. From Figure 7 to Figure 10, we see that both Apriori and SAR-based prefetching significantly improved the cache ratio comparing with the non-prefetching results in all scenarios. This is esp ecially true for the Plays dataset Also, we find SAR perform s better than Apriori for Plays but not necessarily for Medline indicating that the right choice of mining algorithm does depend on the characteristic of the application In both cases, the cache hit ratios have been improved at a cost of additional queries being made to the server. In order to make sure prefetching worthwhile, we also looked at the precision, which is defined by the number of cache hits divided by the number of web accesses. The result is shown in Figure 11 and 12. We see that, from the results the overall precision for SAR is hi gher than that of the non-prefetching version in all but one scenario, meaning the overall effectiveness of the system is improved despite the extra queries.  For Apriori, this is also the case for the Plays queries but not for Medline indicating once again that the ideal choice of mining algorithm should depend on the application characteristic 7 Conclusion We studied the effect of prefe tching of XML queries in client side caches. With a pre-processing step that generates virtual sessions obtain ed by grouping the queries with similar constraint values, each user session can be mapped to multiple transactions that can be processed by association mining algorithms to obtain abstract rules for predicting future XML queries. We found that our prefetching approach improved both the cache hit ratio and the precision of the cache system despite the overhead in issuing additional prefetching queries 8 Acknowledgement The work reported in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong CERG Grant \205 PolyU 5094/00E 9 References  n, L. and Rundensteiner, EA A CE-XQ A CachE-aware XQuery Answering System", ACM SIGMOD Associated Workshop on the Web and Databases \(WebDB\dison, Wisconsin, June 2002 pp 31--36 2 h en, L W a n g S. an d Rund en stein er, EA "A Fine-Grained Replacement Strategy for XML Query Cache " ACM International Workshop on Web Information and Data Mana gement \(WIDM\, McLean Virginia, November 2002, pp 76\20483  ng, He nry Haini ng Z h ang  Ia n Tian Yi Li, Ye  Lu: Mining Web Logs to Improve Web Caching and Prefetching.

4 Statistical Analysis The M-Max subroutine requires that we estimate the probability of an error 226 i.e an itemset which is actually frequent but appears with frequency of less than the lowered frequency threshold in the sample An over estimation may result in an unnecassary decrease in 000 002 004 005 007 which would result in a larger than required number of candidates Here we describe the probability bound we have used in our implementation which outperforms the naive Chernoff bound discussed in the original paper which described the Sampling algorithm Let b n 005 007 n 016 be the frequency of some arbitrary itemset 017 in 020 022  Consider a random sample 023 of size 024 from 020 022  We will assume that transactions in the sample are independent Hence the number of rows in 023 which contain 017 can be seen as a random variable 025 027 022 032 033 034 024 037 005 007   The frequency of 017 in 024 transactions  005 007  025  024 is an estimate for 005 007  which improves as 024 increases The best-known way to bound the chance that  005 007 will deviate from 005 007 is with the Chernoff bound We use a tighter bound for the case of binomial distributions see Hagerup and Rub 7  007 034  005 007   005 007  0 2  4 6 8 016  005 007 016   005 007      A 8 005 007  005 007    A B D Lemma 1 Given a random uniform sample 023 of N transactions from 020 022  a frequency threshold E 032 033 F 007 H I thelowered frequency threshold 000 002 004 005 007  and the negative border of J K L N  A O 023 Q  denoted 024 022  the probability S  T U K V A W that any 017 Y 024 022 will have frequency larger than or equal to E 032 033 F 007 H I hence causing failure is bounded by  024 022   6 8 016  E 032 033 F 007 H I 016  000 002 004 005 007    K L N  A 8 E 032 033 F 007 H I 000 002 004 005 007  K L N  A B D For any speci\036c itemset in 024 022  the probability that this itemset will cause failure is the probability that its estimated frequency is below 000 002 004 005 007 while its actual frequency is above E 032 033 F 007 H I  Substituting E 032 033 F 007 H I for 005 007 and 000 002 004 005 007 for  005 007  the bound gives us  007 034  F 007 H I 034 017 037 020 022   F 007 H I 034 017 037 023   0 c  4 6 8 016  E 032 033 F 007 H I 016  000 002 004 005 007    K L N  A 8 E 032 033 F 007 H I 000 002 004 005 007  K L N  A B D As for the entire 024 022   007 034 e 017 Y 024 022 h 017 005 i 032 000   4 m n o D p  007 034 017 005 i 032 000   4  1 2 4 8 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18  D\212Sampling Speedup Number of Computers Speedup T20.I6.D200M, MinFreq = 1 T10.I4.D375M, MinFreq = 0.5 T5.I2.D600M, MinFreq = 0.25 Linear Speedup  Figure 1 D-Sampling speedup  024 022  6 8 016  E 032 033 F 007 H I 016  000 002 004 005 007    K L N  A 8 E 032 033 F 007 H I 000 002 004 005 007  K L N  A B D Since calculating the negative border is in itself a costly process we choose to relax this bound by substituting  w   J K L N  A O 023 Q  for  024 022   Obviously any itemset in J K L N  A O 023 Q can only be extended by at most  w  items and thus this relaxed bound holds Corollary 1 Toivonen 1996 If none of the itemsets in the negative border caused failure then no other itemset can cause failure Any other itemset 017 outside J K L N  A O 023 Q and 024 022 must include a subset from 024 022  Hence its frequency must be less than or equal to the frequency of this subset It follows that if the frequency of each itemset in 024 022 is below E 032 033 F 007 H I  so is the frequency of 017  5 Experiments We carried out three sets of experiments The 036rst set tested D-Sampling to see how much faster it is to run the algorithm with the database split among 033 machines than to run it on a single node The second set compared DSampling DDM and FDM on a range of E 032 033 F 007 H I values The last one checked scale-up the change in runtime when the number of machines is increased together with the size of the database We ran our experiments on two clusters the 036rst cluster which was used for the 036rst second and fourth sets of experiments consisted of 15 Pentium computers with dual 1.7GHz processors Each of the computers had at least 1 Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

candidates it uses more communication As can be seen from the graphs in 036gure 3 D-Sampling is scalable in two of the tests In fact for mid-range numbers of computers DSampling runs even faster than with 000 001 003  this is due to the superlinear speed-u p discussed earlier The mild slowdown seen in 036gure 3c is due to the smaller average pattern size and the smaller number of candidates in T5.I2.D1200M The larger the number of candidates the greater the saving in candidates when the number of computers increases If there are enough large patterns this saving will compensate for the increasing communication overhead Such is not the case however with T5.I2.D1200M 6 Conclusions and Future Research We presented a new D-ARM algorithm that uses the communication ef\036ciency of the DDM algorithm to parallelize the single-scan Sampling algorithm Experiments prove that the new algorithm h as superlinear speedup and outperforms both FDM and DDM with any 004 006 000 007 b n f value The exact improvement in relation to previous algorithms depends on the number of database scans they require Experiments demonstrat e good scalability provided the database scan is the major bottleneck of the algorithm Some open questions still remain First it would be interesting to continue partitioning the database until every partition becomes memory resident This approach may lead to a D-ARM algorithm that mines a database by loading it into the memory of large number of computers and then runs with no disk-I/O at all Second it would be interesting to have a parallelized version of the other single-scan ARM algorithm 226 DIC 226 on a share-nothing cluster  or of the two-scans partition algorithm Finally we feel that the full potential of the M-Max algorithm has not yet been

9 Here are some observations and explanations on the results 1\The total time of our comparison includes the time to write the association rules to a file; Bit-AssocRule is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the various Apriori algorithms \(64-221 times faster\he test data set, the big the time difference between the BitAssocRule and the various Apriori algorithms. We havenêt compared our algorithm with some of the other association rule algorithms such as VIPER  13,24] \(CHARM and CL OSE are base d on the closed frequent itemsets concept\d on their published comparison results with Apriori, our BitAssocRule is very competitive compared to them and a direct comparison will be conducted and reported in the near future 2\e or litter longer time than the various Apriori algorithms in constructing the 1-itemsets because of the extra cost of building the bitmaps for the 1-itemsets. But after the 1-itsemtset is done, Bit-AssocRule is significant faster than the Apriori algorithms in constructing large frequent itemsets because it only uses the fast bit operations \(AND COUNT and SHIFT\nd doesnêt need to test the subsets of the newly candidate 3\aps of the frequent items, and the bitmap storage \(uncompressed less than the original data set \(1/2 to 1/4 of the original data size The main reasons that Bit-AssocRule algorithm is significant faster than Apriori and its variations are 1\ocRule adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy, the transaction is decompose into vertical bitmap format and leads to focused search of smaller domain There is no repeated scan of entire database in BitAssocRule 2\snêt follow the traditional candidate-generate-and test approach, thus saves significant amount of time to test the candidates 3\basic operations are bit Count and bit And operations, which are extremely faster than the pattern search and matching operations used in Apriori and its variations 5. Conclusion The contributions of this paper are in two aspects:  we extend the application domains of bitmap techniques and introduce the bitmap techniques for complex DSS query optimization and association algorithm. We present a bitmap based query optimization algorithm to optimize complex query with multiple table join based on outer join operations and push the outer join operations from the data flow level to the bitmap level and achieve significant performance gain.   We introduce a novel algorithm to calculate the foundset for those tables involved in the prejoin table by using prejoin_bitmap_indexes and integrate this algorithm into the current commercial data flow based query engine seamlessly. Our query optimization can achieve an order of magnitude faster than conventional query engine Secondly we introduce the bitmap technique to the data mining procedure and develop a bitmap-based algorithm Bit-AssocRule to find association rules. Our BitAssocRule avoids the time-consuming table scan to find and prune the itemsets, all the operations of finding large itemsets from the datasets are the fast bit operations. The experimental result of our Bit-AssocRule algorithm with Apriori and AprioirHybrid algorithms shows Bit-AssocRule is2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster. This research indicates that bitmap technique can greatly enhance the performance for decision support queries and finding association rule, and bitmap techniques are very promising for the decision support query optimization and DM applications Bitmap technique is only one way to improve the performance of complex DSS queries and DM algorithm Parallelism is another crucial factor to improve the performance of DSS and data mining.  We are currently working on paralleling the bitmap-based algorithms and hope to report our findings in the near future 6. References  Agrawal R.

Related work The most similar to the representations based on generalized disjunctive sets is the NDR representation which consists of all frequent non-derivable itemsets [7 8], and the representations based on ?-free sets [7, 9]. It was shown in [8], that for each non-empty itemset Z, one can derive the lower bound \(l\(Z u\(Z on sup\(Z from the fact that sup\(Z Non-derivable itemsets are those for which u\(Z Z gt; 0. If u\(Z Z sup\(Z supersets Y of a derivable itemset are also derivable and u\(Y Y Y such that neither sup\(Z Z Z Z It was proved in [7, 8] that u\(Z Z  u\(Z?{a Z?{a for |Z| ? 1 This important result was used in [7, 8] to determine the upper bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets namely: non-derivable itemsets are not longer than log2|D|? + 1 Hence, the bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets is identical to the bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free sets \(please see Theorem 3.2 It has been proved in [7] that ?-free sets are a subset of non-derivable itemsets, so their length is also bounded by ?log2|D|? + 1 There is a claim in [7, 9] that the generalized disjunction-free sets equal the ?-free sets. This claim however, is not correct, which we will prove by the example beneath. Table 4 contains all generalized disjunction-free sets. Among them, there is {fh}, the support of which equals 0. The support bounds for {fh are found as follows \(please, see [7] for the details  sup\({fh f h   sup\({fh f  sup\({fh h  sup\({fh Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Hence, l\({fh fh fh sup\({fh free, is not a ?-free set Since the families of the generalized disjunction-free sets and ?-free sets may differ, finding the relationship between them or between the generalized disjunction-free sets and non-derivable itemsets remains a challenge 8. Conclusions The representations based on generalized disjunctionfree sets belong to the most concise ones among all lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In 


lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
