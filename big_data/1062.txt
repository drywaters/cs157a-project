Incremental Mining of Web Sequential Patterns Using PLWAP Tree on Tolerance MinSupport C.I Ezeife  School of Computer Science  University of Windsor  Windsor Ontario  Canada N9B 3P4 cezeife@uwindsor.ca Min Chen School of Computer Science University of Windsor Abstract This paper proposes an algorithm PL4UP which uses the PLWAP tree structure to incrementally up 
date web sequential patterns PL4UP initially builds a bigger PLWAP tree that includes all sequences in the database with a tolerance support t that is a fraction of the database minimum support s The position code features of the PLWAP tree are used to eciently mine this tree to extract both current frequent and non-frequent sequences which are likely to become frequent when the database is updated This approach more quickly updates old frequent patterns without the need to re-scan the entire updated database 
Keywords Incremental Mining sequential mining frequent patterns Apriori-like algorithms PLWAP tree Scalability 1 Introduction Sequential pattern mining is based on association rule mining concepts of support condence minimum support minimum condence and frequent sequence pattern When data are inserted or deleted from a database previous patterns may no longer be interesting and new interesting patterns could appear in the updated database The process of generating new patterns in the updated database old  new 
data using only the updated part new data and previously generated patterns is called incremental mining of sequential patterns Although sequential mining is an important data mining task it has received relatively little attention compared with association rules mining especially in the area of incremental mining of sequential patterns 4 E xist This research was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council NSERC of Canada under an

tree that is based on a lower threshold minimum support t which is a fraction of the applications regular minimum support s The tolerance support t is based on the average computed changing rate of data in the database 2 The Proposed Incremental PL4UP Algorithm With F and S representing frequent and small items in original database respectively while F  and S  represent updated large frequent items and updated small items in the updated database U old  new data all events items in updated database U will fall into six categories of items as 1 large in old database DB and still large in updated database U F  F   2 large in old DB but small in U F  S   3 small in old DB but large in U  S  F   4 small in old DB and still small in U  S  S   5 new items that are large in U   F   and 6 new items that are small in U   S   The main idea of PL4UP is to avoid scanning the whole updated database U DB+db but to scan only the changes to the database db Then to perform incremental mining by building a small PLWAP db tree for only these new changes to the database db Once this small PLWAP db is built itcanbeusedtoupdatetheexistingold PLWAP DB  With this approach old patterns can quickly be updated without the need to scan the old DB However this will work for ve of the six cases identied above but not for the third case when S  S  Ifthereare any items in this category the existing PLWAP DB will not contain adequate information regarding all sequences which had these previous small items not shown in the PLWAP DB  so that they could be updated with the new data The PL4UP solution is to use a lower tolerance support in building the initial PLWAP DB tree to accommodate most potentially frequent items Thus from the original PLWAP DB tree the small items S are broken into two groups to get those that are highly likely to become frequent during next database update potentially frequent PF and those that are highly likely to still remain small SS using the tolerance support t which is lower than the regular minimum support such that t  factor  s for 0  factor  1 The limit on the t value suitable for good performance is determined using the average rate of changes in the database collected over a period of time 2.1 Steps in Mining Frequent Patterns Incrementally with PL4UP 1 Construct initial PLWAP tree using tolerance minimum support t instead of minimum support s We obtain the frequent 1-items meeting support s F 1  the frequent 1-items meeting support t F t  the Small 1-items not meeting support s S 1 Fromthe S 1 list we obtain the potentially frequent 1-items in S 1 list but meeting support t PF 1  We also identify the potentially still small 1-items SS 1 in S 1 list but not meeting the support t The candidate 1-items C DB 1  recording the support of all items in the database are also obtained from the database From each transaction in the database we obtain two subsequences the frequent subsequence meeting s requirements  seq s ndthefrequent subsequence meeting the t requirements  seq t  2 Construct a PLWAP tree using the seq t from rst step above and the frequent F t items for header link connections This is called PL 4 UP DB tree 3 Now mine the PL 4 UP DB tree for tolerance frequent patterns called TFP by extracting all patterns with support greater than or equal to t Since TFP includes all SFP for support s requirements patterns that is TFP  SFP  we obtain the needed SFP from the TFP as those patterns with support greater than or equal to minimum support s 4 Now when database changes and we want to update the patterns incrementally Update all intermediate candidate lists and patterns as follows Obtain the updated candidate 1-items C  1 C  1  C 1  C db 1  F  1 and F  t are obtained as items in C  1 with supports greater or equal to regular support s and tolerance support t respectively F db 1  C db 1  F  1 and F db t  C db 1  F  t  Next the updated small potentially frequent and still small items in the changes to database db are obtained as follows S db 1  C db 1  S  1  and PF db  C db 1  PF   5 Construct the small PL4UP tree using only the changes to the database db and with frequent items based on tolerance support F db t Asignificant dierence in this step is that the frequent 1-items used to construct the small db tree is not that directly computed from tolerance support of db but computed from intersecting  C db 1  F  t  6 Combine the frequent patterns from the changes to database db and the old database DB keepProceedings of the International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium \(IDEAS04 1098-8068/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE

4 Experimental and Performance Analysis A performance comparison of PL4UP PLWAP and ISE algorithms was conducted and the results of the experiments are presented in this section All these three algorithms were implemented and run on the same datasets generated using the resource code for generating synthetic datasets downloaded from http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/syndata.html The correctness of the implementations were conrmed by checking that the frequent sequences generated for the same dataset by the three algorithms are the same The experiments were conducted on a Pentium 4 PC machine with 256 megabytes of main memory running Windows operating system The programs were written in C under visual C environment From observation of experimental result we can see that i as the size of the support increases the execution times of all the algorithms decrease ii for the same support the execution time of PL4UP algorithm is less than that of PLWAP and ISE algorithms Experiment 2 Execution Time for Databases with Dierent Sizes We use dierent database sizes that vary from 20k to 100k to compare the three algorithms The minimum support 5 is used for PL4UP ISE and PLWAP and the result of the experiment show that when the inserted transactions become large all the execution times become larger Also the larger size or updates to database aect the execution time of ISE and PLWAP with lower minimum support much more than with higher minimum support The PL4UP always achieves better performance than PLWAP and ISE 5 Conclusions and Future Work ISE 4 o r simila r a pr io r i lik e a lg o r ithms g ener a t e n umerous candidate itemsets that need to be computed at each level and scans the updated database U many times For all types of database updates ISE updates the old generated frequent patterns by mining data level-wise the same way If the PLWAP algorithm is directly used to mine the updated database it has to scan the updated database U two times to construct PLWAP tree and mine the tree step by step without using existing patterns and tree of the original database DB which wastes a lot of reusable resources The proposed PL4UP inherits the advantages of PLWAP and no huge candidate itemsets need to be generated They also fully utilize old existing information like the old patterns and tree for mining the updated database U Future work should investigate applying technique to distributed and parallel mining that may involve continuous time series data and to web content and text mining References 1 A g r a w a l  R  a nd Sr ik a n t R M ining S equen t ia l Patterns Proceedings of the 11th Intl Conference on Data Engineering Taipei Taiwan March 1995 2 H a n  J  K a m b er  M  Da ta Mining  C o n cepts and Techniques Morgan Kaufmann 2001 3 u  Y i E z e i f e C  I   P o s i t i o n C o d e d P r e O r d e r Linked WAP-Tree for Web Log Sequential Pattern Mining Proceedings of The 7th PacicAsia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining PAKDD 2003 Seoul Korea Apr 30May 2003 4 M a sseg lia  F  P o ncelet P  T e isseir e  M  I ncr e mental Mining of Sequential Patterns in Large Databases Actes des 16imes Journes Bases de Donnes Avances BDA00 Blois France October 2000 5 P ei J ia n H a n Jia w e i Mo r t a z a v i-a s l Behza d  Zhu Hua Mining Access Patterns Eciently from Web Logs Proceedings 2000 Pacic-Asia Conf On Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining PAKDD00 Kyoto Japan April 2000 6 P art h asarat h y  S   Zaki  M  J   Ogi h ara M   Dwarkadas S Incremental and Interactive Sequence Mining In Proc.\(1999 of the 8th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management CIKM99 251258 Kansas City MO November 1999 7 S ri k a n t  R am akri sh n a n   A gra w al  R ak esh   M i n ing generalized association rules In proceedings of the 21st Intl Conf on Very Large Databases VLDB Zurich Switzerland Sept 1995 Proceedings of the International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium \(IDEAS04 1098-8068/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE

Conclusions In this paper, we have introduced an efficient implementation of an FP-Tree constructing algorithm and an improved method QFP-grow th for constructing frequent patterns from FP-tree. QFPC can create FP-tree with one database scanning, QFP-growth can generate frequent patterns without conditional pattern-base and conditional FP-tree generation, and the frequent patterns are generated in order. Our future research work is to use the method into implementation of SQL-based, highly scalable FP-tree structure, constraint-based mining of frequent patterns sequential patterns, max-patterns, partial periodicity and other interesting frequent patterns mining References   R Ag rawal a n d R   Sri k ant F a st alg o rithm s  fo r m i ning  association rules.

some are best for dense type datasets Currently there is no single algorithm exist that shows global best performance on all types of datasets The main limitation of previous algorithms is that they really upon only single strategy and do no combine the best features of multiple strategies for speedup the process of itemset mining In this paper we show that combining the best features of multiple strategies into a single hybrid is more beneficial and efficient than relying upon single strategy Our different experimental results on benchmark datasets show that mining all and maximal frequent itemsets using our hybrid approach is more efficient than existing algorithms and gives global best performance 13 T Uno M Kiyomi H Arimura LCM ver 3 Collaboration of Array Bitmap and Prefix Tree for Frequent Itemset Mining In 1st Int'l Workshop on Open Source Data Mining in conjunction with SIGKDD2005 2005 14 M J Zaki and C Hsiao Charm An efficient algorithm for closed association rule mining In Technical Report 99-10 Computer Science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1999 8 References 1 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc ACMSIGMOD Int'l Conf Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc Int'l Conf Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499 Sept 1994 3 S Bashir A Rauf Baig HybridMiner Mining Maximal Frequent Itemsets using Hybrid Database Representation Appraoch In Proc of 10th IEEE-INMIC conference Karachi Pakistan 2005 4 D Burdick M Calimlim and J Gehrke Mafia A maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transactional databases In Proc ofICDE Conf pp 443-452 2001 5 Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations B Goethals and M.J Zaki eds CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 http:HCEURWS.org/Vol-90 6 K Gouda and M J Zaki Efficiently mining maximal frequent itemsets In ICDM pp 163-170 2001 7 G Grahne and J Zhu Efficiently Using Prefix-trees in Mining Frequent Itemsets In Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2003 8 J Han J Pei and Y Yin Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation In SIGMOD pages 1-12 2000 9 J Liu Y Pan K Wang and J Han Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection In Proc of KDD Conf 2002 10 G Liu H Lu Y Xu and J X Yu Ascending frequency ordered prefix-tree Efficient mining of frequent patterns In DASFAA 2003 11 J Pei J Han H Lu S Nishio S Tang and D Yang HMine Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases In Proc of ICDMConf pp 441.448 2001 12 A Pietracaprina and D Zandolin Mining Frequent Itemsets Using Patricia Tries Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 243 


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
