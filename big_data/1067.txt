2004 IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid Privacy-Preserving Association Rule Mining in Large-scale Distributed Systems Assaf Schuster Ran Wolff Bobi Gilburd Computer Science Department Technion  Israel Institute of Technology E-mail:{assaf,ranw,bobi}@cs.technion.ac.il Abstract Data privacy is a major concern that threatens the widespread deployment of Data Grids in domains such as health-care and finance We propose a unique ap proach for obtaining knowledge  by way of a data min ing model  from a Data Grid 
while ensuring that the data is cryptographically safe This is made possible by an in novative yet natural generalization for the accepted trusted third party model and a new privacy-preserving data mining algorithm that is suitable for Grid-scale sys tems The algorithm is asynchronous involves no global communication patterns and dynamically adjusts to changes in the data or to the failure and recovery of re sources To the best of our knowledge this is the first privacy-preserving mining algorithm to possess these fea tures Simulations of thousands of resources prove that our algorithm quickly converges to the correct result while us 
ing reasonable communication. The simulations also prove that the effect of the privacy parameter on both the con vergence time and the number of messages is logarith mic 1 Introduction The objective ora Data Grid is to maximize the availabil ity and utilization of data that was often obtained through the investment of much labor and federal capital. Maximal utilization would be achieved if the owners of different data resources\were able to share it with each other and with the research community at large i.e make it available for ev eryone Nevertheless this is frequently prohibited by legal obligations or commercial concerns Such 
restrictions usu ally do not apply to cumulative statistics of the data Thus the data owners usually do not object to having a trusted third party such as a federal agency\collect and publish these cumulative statistics, provided that they cannot be ma nipulated to obtain information about a specific record or a We thank Intel Corporation and the Mafat Institute for Rrsrwch ilnd Development for their generous support of this research 0-7803-8430-W04F$20.00 02004 IEEE 41 1 specific data source. Trusted third parties are however dif ficult to find and the 
procedure involved is necessarily com plicated and inefficient This scenario is most evident in the health maintenance business. Health Maintenance Organizations HMOs have a high interest in sharing medical data both for public health reasons such as plague control and the evaluation of different medical protocols and for commercial reasons such as detecting medical fraud patterns or medical mis conduct However sharing medical data is very problem atic it is legally forbidden to expose specific records  i.e a patient\222s medical record and it is commercially undesir able to expose statistics about a single 
HMO  e.g mortal ity rates or the average expenditure per client Similar ex amplcs can be found in other domains such as the finan cial domain in which it is desirable to share account infor mation in order to detect money laundering In both these cases the need for global statistics is so great that fedcral agencies do collect them Still the procedures involved are indeed complicated and at least in the HMO domain suf fer from regular information leaks with serious implications for some HMOs Distributed data mining offers a way by 
which data can he shared without compromising privacy On the one hand data mining techniques have been shown to be a leading tool for data analysis, and as such they are likely to satisfy re searchers\222 needs as an interface to the data stored in the Data Grid On the other hand the models produced by data min ing tools are statistical and thus satisfy the privacy concerns of the data owners. Thus, different HMOs can choose to re veal their databases not for direct reading but rather to a dis tributed data mining algorithm that will execute at the dif 
ferent sites and produce a statistical model of the combined database That the algorithm produces statistics is not in it self sufficient an HMO also has to make certain that the data mining algorithm does not leak information through its own operation For instance an algorithm in which each HMO computes its mortality rate and then sends it over to a polling station which computes the global statistics would not meet this criterion because the polling station would he informed of the mortality rate for each HMO This calls for a specific type of distributed data mining algorithm that is 


2004 IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid privacy-preserving Privacy-preserving data mining was first introduced by Agrawal and Srikant in 2MO 3 The original idea pre sented there is to perturb the data by adding random trans actions to the database These perturbations hide the orig inal data but average out in the statistics  i.e the same data mining models are created regardless of the perturha tions Perturbation fully guarantees data privacy and thus this approach is considered sufficient for the sequential set ting Yet in a distributed setting where there are several data sources, perturbation does not maintain the privacy of each of the sources e.g the mortality rate for each HMO Thus a different method must he employed in distributed settings An alternative approach to privacy-preserving data min ing is to replace each message exchange in an ordinary dis tributed data mining algorithm with a cryptographic prim itive that provides the same information without disclos ing the data of the participants for example rcplacing a sum reduction by a cryptographically secured sum reduc tion in which the participants learn only the final sum and not each other\222s partial sums. When practiced well, this ap proach guarantees the privacy of both single rccords and source statistics However all of the algorithms which have taken this approach so far have failed to scale above a few computational nodes They all rely on cryptographic prim itives that are both global  requiring all-to-all communi cation patterns  and rigid  requiring that the primitive be evaluated all over again if the data changes even slightly or a node joins or leaves the system That would be unac ceptable in a Data Grid system which is expected to scale to hundreds of nodes there are hundreds of HMOs in the US alone or even to tens of thousands of nodes a typi cal HMO uses the services of hundreds of independent lah oratories, clinics and medical specialists all of which have their separate databases\especially since communication is to be performed at Internet speeds Consider the algorithm described in 9 for the same dis tributed association rule mining problem that is the subject of this paper On several occasions that algorithm requires that a message traverse all of the computing nodes twice one-by-one, and that the algorithm hang until the message does so Furthermore if the data in even one part of the dis tributed database changes just slightly the whole algorithm has to he executed all over again The algorithm pays no regard to the possibility that one of the nodes might fail Clearly, this is unacceptable in large-scale systems The main contribution of this paper is in presenting a cryptographic privacy-preserving association rule mining algorithm in which all of the cryptographic primitives in volve only pairs of participants and are thus scalable We use a non-private association rule mining algorithm as a ba sis and replace the message that was sent by resources with encrypted versions which the recipient cannot decrypt By virtue of the encryption scheme we use oblivious counters a resource can still perform most of the steps required by the non-private algorithm by itself Several steps require the assistance of a manager Man agers are stateless entities implemented as part of the Data Grid infrastructure whose sole purpose is to decrypt mes sages thus there can be many of them and they can he lo cated as near to the resource as required  possibly even on the same machine It is important to note that a manager is not a trusted third party Instead using its ability to de crypt messages it can help the resource perform those steps without either of them learning anything other than the fi nal outcome of the algorithm Since the basic algorithm we use is extremely scalable in itself and since our transformation of it does not require global operators our algorithm can he shown to be scal able to millions of resources well above the current re quirements of Grid systems Furthermore the algorithm re sponds very efficiently to changes in the databases, espe cially if the changes are minute and do not affect the out come of the algorithm A key quality of our algorithm is that it offers a trade-off between the amount of privacy at tainable \(measured in the sire of the population on which the statistics are evaluated\and the computational effort re quired to attain this privacy Still even when the maximal security level is required the algorithm maintains some of its qualities such as the efficient response to changes in the data Finally the algorithm does not as our analysis re veals disclose any information other than the list of fre quent itemsets and the list of correct rules 2 Related Work The distributed association rule mining ARM prob lem has been studied for nearly a decade Until recently however none of the algorithms presented for this prob lem could scale above several dozens of participants The first scalable algorithm for the distributed ARM problem was presented in 14 Since our algorithm is based on that work we thoroughly describe it in Section 4 Nevertheless the algorithm does not preserve privacy; specifically if a re source communicates with the system via a single neigh bor then that neighbor will learn the resource\222s statistics e.g the mortality rate for that HMO Privacy-preserving data mining has received a lot of at tention in the past few years In 3 51 techniques based on perturbing the original data before initiating the mining pro cess were used. However this approach can only secure the privacy of records and not of the sources e.g of the pa tients but not of the HMOs An alternative to the perturbation approach is to develop cryptographically secured versions of the data mining al gorithm This has been shown to be possible for three data 412 


2004 IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid mining problems distributcd ARM the same problem dis cussed in this paper 191 ARM in vertically partitioned data I31  i.e where each transaction is split among several nodes, and decision tree induction IO The main problem with these three algorithms is that the cryptographic prim itives they use are global and rigid The evaluation of ev ery primitive requires the participation of all of the nodes and if the data at even one of the nodes changes or a sin gle node joins or leaves the system the process has to be repeated from scratch This means that none of these algo rithm can be employed in Data Grid scales 3 Problem Definition A Data Grid is composed of a group of resource nodes St  computers which contain parts of the database and a group of management nodes It  computcrs that manage thc system all of which communicate by exchanging mes sages via an overlay network composed of a SC ofedges Et The composition of the system may vary with time That is S AIc and Et may be different from St It and E Nev ertheless we assumc that an underlying mcchanism main tains a communication tree that spans all the resources We refer to the nodes of St as resources and to those of Mt as managers We denote E the set of edges colliding with a resource U at timet Neithcr the resources nor the managers trust each other Instead we make two accepted cryptographic assumptions on them The first is that they are honest-but-curious also referred to as semi-honest 7 they follow the protoco1,but may try to learn as much as they can from the computations they make and from messages they receive The honest-hut curious model was found useful in many domains includ ing data-mining  12,9 and secure information sharing I The second assumption is that colluding 7 is not allowed either between a resource and a manager a similar assump tion is made in 12,4 or between two resources as in 9 or two managers The association rule mining ARM problem is tradi tionally defined as follows Let I  iL,i2  im be the items in a certain domain An itemset is some sub set X 2 I A transaction t is also a subset of I associ ated with a unique transaction identifier A database DB is a list that contains IDBI transactions Given an item set X and a database DB Support X DB is the num ber of transactions in DB which contain all the items of X threshold MinFreq E 0,1 we say that an itemset X is frequent in a database DB if Freq X DB 2 MinFreq and infrequent otherwise For two distinct frequent item sets X and Y and a confidence threshold MinConf E 0,1 we say the rule X  Y is confident in DB if Freq X U Y DB 2 MinConf  Freq X DB We call and Freq X DB  Support\(X.DB lDBl  For some frequency confident des between frequent itemsets correct and the remaining rules false The solution of the ARM problem is R DB all the correct rules in the given database In many applications the database is updated over time and hence DBt will denote the database at time t and R DBt the rules that are correct in that database In dis tributed association rule mining the database is also parti tioned among the resources is different HMOs connected to the Data Grid We denote the union of partitions belong ing to a group of resources S C St by DBf that is DBt equals DBT When the number of resources is large and the frequency of updates is high it may not be feasible to propagate the changes to the entire system at the rate they occur Thus it is beneficial if an incremental algorithm can compute ad hoc results quickly and improve them as more data is propagated Such algorithms are called anytime a gorithms The performance of an anytime algorithm is mea sured by its average recal and precision Let Ru D be the ad hoc solution known to the resource U at time t The recall and precision of U at that time are R DBL]nR[DB  An anytime algorithm is said to be and Ik..[DBtII correct if during static periods, in which the database and the system do not change both the average recall and the average precision converge to one A distributed ARM algorithm is said to be privacy preserving if an observer that has access to all of the data of a single resource or a single manager \(database, internal variables and all of the messages it received plus some do main knowledge 7f e.g the demographic characteristics of a certain HMO

2004 iEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid 4 Prerequisites The work presented here relies on two bodies of re search a scalable algorithm for association rule mining which does not require global communication and a cryp tographic technique called oblivious counters Following is a short description of these methods 4.1 A Scalable Distributed Association Rule Min ing Algorithm  Majority-Rule In a previous paper  141 we describe Majority-Rule  a highly scalable distributed ARM algorithm The algorithm is based on two main inferences That the distributed ARM problem is reducible to a sequence of majority votes and that if the vote is not tied majority voting can be done by a scalable algorithm  which we also present in that paper Since it turns out that the frequency of an overwhelming number of candidate itemsets is significantly different from MinFreq i.e., the vote is not ticd\the outcome of these two observations is a local and thus highly scalable, distributed ARM algorithm The idea behind the scalable majority voting algorithm  Scalable-Mujority  is to have every node agree with its im mediate neighbors about the majority In the case of a dis agreement with a neighbor the node will share with that neighbor the evidence it has for the majority The node will make sure it does not mislead its neighbor by taking care to update it whenever that evidence is weakened as a result of other updates or as a result of a change in its vote This is achieved by storing at each node its input hit its vote the last message it sent to each of its neighbors and the last message it received from them Each message contains evidence which consists of two integers count and sum The first is the number of input bits the mes sage counts The latter is the number of those which me set. Each pair of neighbors computes the evidence that has been agreed upon Auv  Auu  sum f sumvu  X count cant where sumUU and countUw com prise the evidence stored in the last message sent from U to U sumVU and countVU comprise the most recent evi dence sent from zi to U and X is the majority threshold Ad ditionally node U computes the total evidence it has been informed of Au  sum  Xwunt where N is the set of U'S neighbors plus L which represents U itself countLu is defined as one and sum is one if U'S input bit is set and zero otherwise. Upon initialization each node that votes one sends this evidence to its neigh bors Then whenever A or A changes U will evaluate the following condition in order to decide whether it should send its current evidence to zi A 2 0 and A  A or A  0 and A  A This is referred to as the Majority-Rule Condition If it evaluates true U will send U the sum of the evidence collected from U'S vote and its other neighbon with the result that A be set to A To see how Scalable-Majority translates into an associ ation rule mining algorithm Majority-Rule consider a ma jority vote in which the transactions vote over every candi date itemset with each transaction voting one if it contains the itemset and zero otherwise and with X set to MinFreq Similarly to decide whether a rule is confident, the transac tions again must vote This time only transactions that in clude the left-hand side of the rule vote and their vote is one if they contain the right-hand side and zero otherwise X is set this time to MinConf It is left to show how candidates are generated Note that in Majority-Rule candidates must bc rules This is because Majority-Rule is an anytime algorithm, and as such it can not wait for termination before it produces rules Here a generalization of Apriori's Z criterion is used Each re source u.generaies initial candidate rules of the form 0  i for each i E I Then, each time it updates the candidate rule set it generates for each rule 0  X E E LIBt new candidate rules X  i  i for all i E X Additionally the resource will look for pairs of rulcs in 8 D which have the same left-hand side and right-hand sides that dif feronlyinthelastitem-X YU{il}andX YU{i2 For every is E Y the resource will verify that the rule X  Y U il,iz  i3 is also correct and then gener ate the candidate X  Y U il i2 It can be shown that the minimal set ofcandidate rules is created when I D is 100 precise 4.2 Oblivious Counters We denote public-key cryptosystems by E,D Epub\(m is the encryption of a given plain text m us ing the public key pub and DpyZu\(c is the decryption of a given cipher text c using the corresponding pri vate key prizi As we deal with a single key-pair we write E m instead of Epub m and D c instead of D c A public-key cryptosystem E D is called probabilis tic 8 if the encryption process involves in addition to the plain and public key a random element such that given two ciphers encrypted with uniformly selected random el ements it is hard to verify that they encode the same plain We denote E z  the rerandomization of E z  an other element in the cipher range such that D E z D E z but ET A public-key cryptosystem E D A A is called ad ditively homomorphic if there exist polynomial algorithms A and A such that for all E\(z E\(y 7  E z with high probability A E x E y  E z  y A E z E Y  E x  Y 414 


2004 IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid An additively homomorphic public-key cryptosystem can be used to implement oblivious counters by which one can add two ciphers without knowing their plain By us ing A iteratively one can easily calculate E m  z from E z for some m E A In the interest of clarity we mark E z E y for A E z E Y E 2 lEJy for A E z E y miE z for E m  z and CE z There are several cryptosystems which are both prob abilistic and additively homomorphic In such cryptosys tems the rerandomization operator can he implemented for example by E z  E z E 0 For implementing the oblivious counters, the algorithm proposed in this paper uses the popular Paillier cryptosystem I I  an additively homomorphic probabilistic cryptosystem over Z How ever, any other such cryptosystem can be uscd Finally we note that in order to support the encryption of ncgative inte gers standard shifting techniques can he applied forAf  A+\(A+\(E\(zi E\(z z 5 K-Private Distributed Association Rule Mining We now describe Private-Majority-Rule a k-private dis tributed association rule mining algorithm The master plan of Private-Majority-Rule is similar to that of Majoriry-Rule the resources perform majority votes over candidate rules to decide whether they are frequent and confident How ever in Private-Majority-Rule all of the counters are en crypted into oblivious counters that cannot be decrypted by the resources This ensures that a resource can never dis cover the data of its neighbors The only ones which can decrypt the counters are managers however a manager will never be given the oblivious counter directly Instead, when ever a resource has to decide whether to send a message to its neighbor it performs a secure protocol with a manager by the end of which the resource learns whether the mes sage should be sent and the manager learns nothing Also whenever new candidates should be generated, the resource performs a similar protocol with a manager by the end of which the resource learns the new candidate set and noth ing more and the manager learns nothing The private majority voting procedure we use is simi lar to the one described in 6 with one important differ ence In 6 the resource is not allowed to lean the ma jority However in privacy-preserving association rule min ing many majority votes are performed  one for each can didate  and those votes are dependent in the sense that a vote taking place for 0  U b signifies that the major ity for both 0  a and 0  b is one What this means is that, unlike the model discussed in 6 our majority vot ing algorithm must remain privacy-preserving even though a resource does learn the majority 5.1 Private-Majority-Rule Algorithm Consider a system composed of resources running Majority-Rule with all votes and consequently all mes sages encrypted in oblivious counters. Instead of maintain ing sumuv cmnluv sumvu countuu A and Auu it will maintain sum count sum count A and A  their encrypted versions mnt counts trans actions But in order to maintain k-resources privacy we also need to count resources For this purpose we add the counter num When the resource needs to send a neigh bor a message that sums the evidence provided by the rest of its neighbors it will use the c algorithm to sum the oblivi ous counters Problems arise only when it needs to evaluate the counters when it needs to decide whether a mes sage should be scnt or what the majority is In both these cases it must consult with a manager. Ncvenheless it is es sential that the manager not learn the contents of the oblivi ous counters Our first step thus is describing a secure primitive  PrivateEvalCond Algorithm I  by which a resource can use a manager to evaluate a condition without disclosing to the manager the contents of the respective oblivious coun ters The primitive's input is a tuple of encrypted values  xpr and a condition which should he evaluated on them The algorithm proceeds in three main steps First, the tuple is hidden among M similar ones Then the group of tuples is sent to a manager which decrypts them all and returns a vector containing the results of evaluating the condition on each tuple Finally the resource will choose the true result from amongst the returned values A re source will use this primitive on two occasions The first is when its input has changed and it has to decide whether to update a neighbor The condition in this case is that for the candidate rule considered either the Majoriry-Rule condition evaluates true or C,EN,Ycount  k mean ing the resource does not retain k-transactions privacy or CvEN,.numUU  k meaning the resource does not retain k-resources privacy The second occasion is when the re source needs to how whether the rule is correct; here, the condition is that Sign Au 2 0 and C,,N~counl 2 k and vEN,-numUV 2 k Using this secure primitive Private-Majoriry-Rule con tinues as follows Where a resource u in Majoriry-Rule would evaluate the condition on A and Auu to decide whether a message should be sent to a neighbor w in Private-Majoriry-Rule u will initiate the PrivareEvalCund primitive and send the message if the result is true When u needs to generate new candidates it will again initiate the PrivateEvalCond primitive in order to discover for each candidate whose oblivious counters have changed whether the rule is correct It will then generate new candidates according to the criteria defined in the Majority-Rule al 41 5

This is because the chances of guessing where the true inputs are hidden are lower than h Moreover, consecutive calls are independent and thus can not assist in boosting this proba bility The third somewhat more involved observation is that when U'S vote changes it is impossible to guess the change unless it affects the majority in a group of either transac tions or resources of size k Assume for example that U'S vote does change the majority in such a group In this case a random guesser that is given the majority before the change the majority after the change, and the information that there has been a change would do,just as well in guessing the ac tual change Now assume that the change in U'S vote does not affect the majority and suppose first that the major ity is of ones We claim that the resulting pattern of mes sages is independent of the data and thus nothing can be learned by looking at such patterns This is true because in Private-Scalable-Majority sum is first decreased below the new value and then increased to the new value see Al gorithm 2 Thus the change will first decrease A and then increase it If messages are sent they will be in response to Algorithm 2 Private-Scalable-Majority  Algorithm for a resource Input sum count A Private dynamic sum and count registers and the rational majority ratio X  X,/Xd Local variables The set of colliding edges E the privacy parameter k and the managers common public key Definitions NF  I U v E V  uw E E  E\(sum  E\(ccmnt numi2c  E\(I X,pi sum~&+sum Ani mnt::',U,+count:;c Outpuf Return the output of PrivateEvalCond3 with my where Cond ZI,XZ.Z  zl 2 k A zZ 2 k A z3 2 01 using C,E,VPcount C.tNrnum A as the inputs xl x2 x3 respectively Updule\(o sum t CwPUEN;1sum;2c count t Send sum;Zc count;;c num:zc to U MajorityCond\(u Return the output of PrivateEvalCond4 with my where Cond\(z1,xZ,z3,z4  ZI k V Xz<k v 23<0AZ4<0 v 23>0/\\Z4>0 using CWEN~coimtZ Cw,Nrnum::c A A;:clA;n as the inputs zl XZ z3 zq respectively On initialization for each uu E E or on failure or re covery of a neighbor v Set sum sum count count;:L num and On receiving sum count num from U Set sum t sum count t count numE t num On change in sum from s to sf Set sum to min\(s s  1 and call Onchange then set sum to maz\(s,s  1 and call Onchange finally set sum to s and call Onchange On a change in one of the local counters  OnChange For each neighbor U if MajorityCond\(v call Updafe\(v the decrease An increase in Au does not trigger messages if A is already positive The same argument holds when there is a majority of zeroes Hence, the pattern of mes sages is indeed independent of the data and nothing can be learnt from it A  ZvtNP Xdtsum:~',u,-X,icount    Cwj&E N cozLnt22cU,U num;;l,u Cw+vE N;'num to E 0 6 Experimental Results To evaluate the performance of Private-Majority-Rule we implemented a simulator capable of running thou sands of simulated resources The network topol ogy was generated using the BRIE topology gen erator ht tp   www c s bu  edu/bri t e Syn thetic databases were produced using the stan 41 6

Anyway, forward the message to the appro priate local Private-Scalable-Majon\222ty instance dard generation tool from IBM Quest group http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest Three databases were generated T512 T1014 and T2016 where the number after the T denotes the average transac tion length and the number after the I stands for the av erage pattern length Each database contains a million transactions Using standard pair-wise independent hash ing techniques, transactions are sampled from the database to simulate the local database of each resource Ex cept in Figure 2b the privacy argument k always equals 10 At the beginning of the simulation each resource samples 10,000 transactions which it processes in batches of about 150 After processing each batch it decides what messages should be sent and on every fifth batch it also communi cates with its manager to create new candidate rules We simulate dynamic databases by incrementing every resource with ten additional transactions at each batch We simulate dynamic composition changes by using 50 resources at the outset and adding an average of five at each hatch stop ping at about 2,500 resources. Transactions continue to he added and messages exchanged until the systems reach a near-stasis the computation never really terminates because transactions continue to be added Throughout this process we measure the recall and precision compared to the precal culated result, of the result at each resource In addition we count the number and type of messages that are exchanged The main results are presented in Figure I Figure la de scribes the recall of the algorithm In all three databases by the time each resource scans its pan of the database for the second time the recall has already reached 90 This is in comparison to just one scan in the Majority-Rule algo rithm 14 In the Private-Majority-Rule algorithm, a rule cannot be found correct before the algorithm gathers infor mation from k resources Thus candidate generation occurs more slowly and hence the delay in the convergence of the recall Figure Ib describes the precision of the algorithm The average precision also climbs above 90 in about two database scans An interesting phenomenon is the decline in precision for the T20.16 database toward the end of the first scan A deeper look reveals that the choice of MinFreq and MinConf led to the creation around that time of a very large number of candidate rules Sheer numbers dic tate that only a few of these candidates would he false pos itives. However since the number of correct rules is only ahout a hundred these false positives led to a noticeable de cline in precision Note however that the false positives were quickly identified and did not significantly impair the convergence rate of the precision for this database Figure IC describes the communication pattern of the algorithm broken down according to the context of the message resource-to-resource communication for the pur pose of an update resource-to-manager communication for the purpose of deciding whether to send a message and resource-to-manager communication for the purpose of de ciding whether a rule is correct and generating new candi dates accordingly At the beginning many candidates are generated. Because the resource has not yet gathered infor mation from k resources the manager will give a positive answer every time it is asked whether an update should be sent This explains the large quantity of update messages in the first database scan Another notable pattern is an increase in the amount of manager consultation messages However as time passes 41 7

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
