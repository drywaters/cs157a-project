Using Fuzzy Support and Confidence Setting to Mine Interesting Association Rules Yo-Ping Huang Department of Computer Science and Engineering Tohmg University Taipei, Taiwan I0451 R.O.C E-mail yphuang@ttu.edu.tw Abshad  This paper proposes a fuzzy model to derive the appropriate minimum support and confidence thresholds for mining the association rules The traditional data mining technologies of association rules usually base on user-defined minimum support and confidence values The most important problem is how to select the appropriate minimum support and confidence to find frequent itemsets Apriori algorithm the widely adopted approach exploits the following property to 
derive the frequent itemset If an itemset is frequent so are all its subsets That is Apriori algorithm generates itemsets in a level wise manner where each candidate in the jth iteration is generated from previous frequent lj-1 A generated candidate can be further pruned if any subset of size j-1 is not a frequent itemset Apriori algorithm relies on the essential assumption that all itemsets have a uniform minimum support value i.e we assume that all items in the dataset have the same nature e.g all the items have the same sale price or the same salability condition in different time intervals or locations However the 
assumption may not comply with the rules embedded in the large databases. Concept hierarchy is helpful to solve the problem and the support and confidence thresholds should vary especially while we consider items at different conceptual abstractions For example turkey and pumpkin pie are seldom sold together However if we look at the transactions in the week before Thanksgiving we may discover that most transactions contain turkey and pumpkin pie It means that we should apply different support values to different time intervals In this paper we present a framework of multilevel association rules mining in the presence of fuzzy concept hierarchies that will derive a reasonable minimum support and confidence setting without losing 
potential interesting rules Keywords Multilevel association rules mining fuzzy control model, concept hierarchy data mining I INTRODUCTION Association rule mining is an important process in data mining I-3,5,11,13-14,161 Some applications even need us to mine association rules in multiple levels of abstraction 8 For example a user may only concem with the associations between 223computer\224 and 223printer\224 Furthermore, he/she even wants to know the association between desktop PC price and laser printer price Constructing a concept hierarchy and then trying to discover knowledge in the multi-level abstractions can solve this problem Some approaches for mining multilevel rules are proposed. For example one can apply the Apriori algorithm 2 to examine data items at multiple levels of abstraction under the same minimum support

rare items we have to set minimum support very low However this may produce too many rules because those frequent items will be associated with one another in all possible ways and many of them are meaningless We should apply different minimum supports to different concept levels Some approaches are developed and progressively reducing the minimum support at different levels of abstraction is one of the methods 9 This method leads to fmd interesting rules at multiple concept levels which may not only discover rules at different levels but may also have high potential to fmd nontrivial and informative rules In effect concept hierarchy allows us to view the data at more meaningful and explicit abstractions and makes the discovered 
patterns easier to understand 7 However, none of existing methods deal with the ambiguity in conceptual abstraction Some examples can illustrate our point of view let\222s consider that if items X and Y have higher support in May and if we set lower minimum support for other months in the year we probably lose interesting rules that could be discovered in either the beginning of June or the end of April Another example is to consider the items\222 price effect on association rules Assuming that people buy computers and printers together is a common sense to us But is there any way to know whether people buy expensive laser printer while 
they buy expensive personal computer Fig 1 is the concept hierarchy that shows only the concept of desktop PC and laser printer Fig 2 is the concept hierarchy that displays the concept abstraction level of desktop PC and laser printer prices This is not a simple Boolean association rules mining Our work for mining rules is not just taking the item\222s quantitative attributes into consideration As we know, the quantitative attributes of items such as item price or transaction time stamp could he considered as fuzzy attributes 9 For example a price for product A may be considered as high, but the same price may 514 0-7803-8376-1/04/$20.00 Copyright 2004 IEEE 


be just medium for product B or even may be categorized as low price for another product The ambiguity exists in conceptual abstraction In this paper we will introduce the fuzzy set to explicitly represent and process this ambiguity A fuzzy set is an extension of a crisp set. Crisp sets only allow full membership or no membership at all where fuzzy sets allow partial membership In fuzzy logic every thiig is a matter of degree 17 It means that we cannot define a certain price only belonging to a certain set. And that also implies that the support value not only varies in different concept level but also varies in the same level of conceptual abstraction Fig 3 illustrates the fuzzy concept hierarchy for this example In this paper, by extending the multilevel mining method of association rules proposed by 8 a fuzzy inference model for deriving minimum support in the same concept abstraction level is developed The main contribution in our proposed method is that one more virtual conceptual level is added to help us find association rules with quantitative attributes consideration The fuzzy inference model will be applied to this special concept level to processing the ambiguity and then deriving reasonable minimum support values In effect different minimum support values represent different input conditions and will lead us to obtain different pattems. That is we have the ability to know the output pattems we got under what input conditions; therefore it is not necessary to define a lower minimum support value to prevent losing interesting rules This paper is organized as follows In section 2 the concepts related to our framework are introduced In section 3 an improved multilevel mining metbod of association rules is proposed In section 4 an experiment is conducted to identify our proposed framework. The study is concluded in section 5 11 RELATED WORKS A Apriori Algorithm The key of mining association rules is to set an appropriate support and confidence values to fid frequent itemset The well-known algorithm Apriori exploits the following property If an itemset is frequent so are all its subsets Apriori algorithm generates itemsets in a level-wise manner where each candidate k-itemset il  ik.2 ih ih in the kth iteration is generated from two frequent k-1 il    ik.2 ik and il    ik.2 ih A generated candidate can be further pruned if any subset of size k-Z cannot satisfy user defined thresholds such as minimum support The rules generated from the Apriori algorithm are known as Boolean association rules The mining of Boolean association rules did not deal with any attributes in database Attributes in database can be quantitative e.g age and income or categorical e.g zip code The mining of quantitative association rules tries to find rules in database containing both quantitative and categorical amibutes 15 An example of such a rule might be 22310 of married people between ages 40 to 60 have at least 2 cars\224 Our research is also taking quantitative attributes into consideration, but rather than mining quantitative association rules No matter Boolean or quantitative association rules mining the minimum support setting is always a problem In reality the minimum support should not be uniform This is especially true in mining multilevel association rules B Concept Hierarchy Concept hierarchies allow the discovery of knowledge at multi-level abstraction It defines a sequence of mappings fiom a set of low-level concept to high-level a more general concept In order to explore multilevel association rules mining one needs to provide data at multiple levels of abstraction This work can be done by providing concept taxonomies from the primitive level concepts to higher levels In many applications the taxonomy information is either stored implicitly in the database or provided by experts or users or computed by using cluster analysis methods 6 With the recent development of data warehousing and OLAP technology arranging data at multiple levels of abstraction has been an ordinary practice 4 Hence in this research we assume such concept taxonomies exist C Fuzzy Logic Control Fuzzy control which directly uses fuzzy rules, is the most important application in fuzzy set theory Using a procedure originated by Mamdani et al in the late 70s 12 three steps are taken to create a fuzzy controller 1 Fuzzification Using membership functions to graphically describe a situation 2 Rule evaluation and decision making \(Application of 3 Defuzzification and action taking \(Obtaining the crisp results In the design of a fuzzy controller one must identify the main inputfoutput control parameters and determine a term set that is at the right level of granularity for describing the values of each linguistic variable For example a term set for linguistic variable price may be defmed as low, medium high Several different types of fuzzy membership functions can be adapted to map crisp input values to partial membership degrees Assuming the control knowledge rule base can be well defined by experts and then we can make decisions according to input parameters and knowledge rule base Since the decisions outputs are still fuzzy we need to 224form these fuzzy outputs to crisp values Following is a simple example to show how fuzzy controls are constructed consider the following classic situation the inverted pendulum Here the problem is to balance a pole on a mobile platform that can move in only two directions to the left or to the right The angle between the platform and the pendulum and the angular velocity of this angle are chosen as the inputs of the system The speed of the platform is chosen as the corresponding output Then a knowledge rule base can be constructed by experts or experienced people. The final speed can be calculated through the above three steps fuzzy rules 515 


D Multilevel Association Rules Mining In multilevel association rules mining different minimum support setting should apply to different concept levels Some algorithms have been developed for efficient mining One approach progressively reduced the minimum support thresholds at lower levels of abstraction PI The underlying assumption in 8 was only to explore the descendants of the frequent items since if an item rarely occurs its descendants will occur even less frequently and thus are uninteresting The following describes the procedure of Hank algorithm 8 to find frequent pattems 1 Discover frequent pattems and strong association rules at the top-most concept level. Assume the minimum support at this level is 5 percent and the minimum confidence is 50 percent One may fmd a set of single frequent items each called a frequent 1-itemset a set of pair-wised frequent items each called a frequent 2-itemset and a set of strong association rules. At the second level if the minimum support is 2 percent and the minimum confidence is 40 percent, one may fmd frequent I-itemsets and frequent 2-itemsets and strong association rules 2 The process repeats at even lower concept levels until no frequent pattems can be found 111 THE EXITXDED MODEL In our extended model, we are going to find association rules that consider item\222s quantitative attributes To simply our discussion we will use the example shown in Fig 1 as a running example to illustrate ow framework. The approach is divided to the following steps A Mining Multilevel Association Rules First we use a hierarchy encoded transaction table instead of the whole original transaction table This is because a data mining query is usually in relevance to only a part of the transaction database sncb as computer and/or printer rather than all the items At this stage we do the multilevel association rules mining without considering any quantitative attributes We need to set the minimum support very carefully in order to collect all possible association rules In effect, the main purpose here is to do several times of evaluation to find reasonable minimum support range for each concept level The method we used is the multilevel mining algorithm for association rules described in section 2 B Adding One Concept Abstraction Level to Express Quantitative Concept The rules generated at the previous stage may be massive since the quantitative attributes are not taking into consideration Sometimes people may want to know for example the association related to price or purchase quantity Assume that people buy computers and printers together is a common sense to us But is there any way to know whether people buy expensive laser printer as they buy expensive personal computer At this stage one virtual concept abstraction level is added to represent the concept for a special quantitative attribute that may have some relations to mined rules This virtual concept abstraction is helpful for mining rules more related to consumer behavior For example, we can have 1 the association about famous brand sale; and 2 the association about marketing in different time interval Fig 2 is the example of concept hierarchy abstraction to express PC and price concept of laser printer. As we can see the price abstraction level partitioned into two or three concepts is added. However, new problem comes along with minimum support setting at this newly added virtual concept abstraction According to multilevel mining algorithm for association rule we sbould apply only one minimum support value at this level Therefore a lower minimum support value could be applied to collecting rules as many as possible. But there are also lots of uninteresting rules generated at this scenario Frequent items will be associated with one another in all possible ways and many of them are meaningless Setting a uniform threshold at this virtual level seems unreasonable to the human sense Let\222s use ow running example to demonstrate our approach In general expensive items usually have lower support value and medium price items have higher support This observation leads us towards to define for example three minimum supports setting for high medium and low price items Now we could use a higher minimum support to find the associations just related to medium price items This is trivial however if one wants to know the associations including medium and bigb price items then what minimum support should apply That is we would like to know whether there is a way to adjust minimum support setting that will fit our requirements rather than using previous fixed settings to mine rules C Constructing Fuuy Control Model to Infer Reasonable Minimum Support Setting Linguistic ambiguity usually exists in virtual concept abstraction Our example does not deal with this ambiguity On the contrary the price of any single item can only belong to one single price range set This is Boolean algebra that partitions universal domain into disjointed sets and an element either belongs to a certain set or does not belong to that set This does not comply with the human perception The fuzzy set concept is better than the partition method because the fuzzy set provides a smooth transition between member and non-member of a set 9 We should tum ow discrete concept abstraction to fuzzy concept abstraction and Fig 3 shows ow modification We then can set up a fuzzy control model as following steps 1 Identifying the linguistic input/output variables, e.g the PC price and laser printer price will be input variables and output will be minimum support Each variable has its own linguistic term set, e.g., high and low 2 Selecting the fuzzy membership functions for each input/output variable 3 Setting up the knowledge base 516 


4 Fuzzifying each input value by its corresponding 5 Applying the knowledge rule base to resolving the 6 Defuzzifying the fuzzy output to its crisp value Fig 4 shows the fuzzy control model for infemng a membership function conflict and making the decision reasonable minimum support value D Mining Association Rules with Inferred Minimum Support We can set a fuzzy control model to infer minium confidence value as well We could then apply the mining algorithm for association rules to discovering rules under a predefined condition Since the threshold value is inferred from a fuzzy control model the pattems will not lose the items in the sharp boundary between partitioned intervals IV EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section we will use our running example to evaluate the extended model Table 1 shows the price information about desktop PC and laser printer Table 2 shows the minimum support range from low to high We assume that multilevel association mining work is done and we like to know association rules about PC price from 570 to 625 and laser printer price from 250 to 270 In our model, both the PC price and printer price are the input variables. Minimum support value is the output variable Fig 5 shows the input/output variables and their corresponding membership functions Fig 6 is the knowledge base The crisp value of the control action is converted by using the COM \(Center of Maximum method. Table 3 shows the output results after defuzzification and the minimum output will be chosen as minimum support value Table 4 shows the comparing results between fuzzy minium support and uniform minimum support The output from fuzzy minimum support is reduced to almost half size of uniform setting Now we can take less time to review our mined rules and the most important is these rules should contain itemsets that match predefined price range Since the minimum support value is derived from a fuzzy inference model, the rules may reveal some surprising information to us V CONCLUSION We have extended the scope of multilevel association rules mining By adding one virtual concept abstraction level we can discover rules more realistic. We also defme different threshold settings for different concept levels and construct a fuzzy control inference model to derive the fuzzy minimum support values at the same concept level The major contribution of our model is to overcome the problem caused by the uniform minimum support setting. In other words, we can set a higher minimum support value derived from a mathematical method instead of setting a lower minimum support to prevent from losing interesting rules The benefit is that we get fewer rules without losing potential valuable association rules Our given example shows that our approach is easy to implement. Furthermore, by properly defining the virtual concept abstraction levels we can mine association rules more realistic to human sense e.g different locations lie north/south areas, different seasons or any time interval famous brandnon-famous brand concepts sale price and sale volume We can also specify more fuzzy linguistic terms to enhance fuzzy inference model that allows mined rules more comprehensible ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is sup orted by National Science Council Taiwan R.O.C ungr Grants NSC92-22,l3-E:036-017 NSC92-2516-S-036-001 and by Tatung University under Grant 89208-102-025 REFERENCES I R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami 223Mining association NICS between sets of item in large databases,\224 Pmc 1993 ACMSIGMOD Int Con Management of Doto pp.207-216 Washington D.C May 1993 R Agrawal and J.C Shafer 223Parallel mining of association des design implementation, and experience,\224 IEEE Tram Knowledge and Data Eng vol 8, pp.962-969 1996 R Agrawal and R Srikant 223Fast algorithms for mining association N~s,\224 Proc 1994 Int\222l Conj Very Large Data Bares pp.487499 Santiago, Chile, Sept 1994 S Chaudhuri and U Dayal 223An overview of data warehousing and OLAP technology,\224 ACMSIGMOD Record vol 26 pp.65-74 1997 E Cohen M Dam S Fujiwarq A Gionis P Indyk R Motwani J Ullman, and C Yang 223Finding interesting associations without supporl pruning,\224 Proc Int\222l Con Dolo Eng ICDE pp.489499 Feb 2000 I Ha\224 Y Cai and N Cercone 223Data-driven discovery of quantitative rules in relational databases,\224 IEEE Tram Knowledge and Data Eng vol 5 pp.2940 1993 7 I Han and M Kamber Data Mining Concept and Techniques Morgan Kaufmann San Francisco USA, 2001 8 J Han and Y Fu 223Mining multi-level association rules in large database,\224 IEEE Tmanr Knowledge and Data Eng vol 1 I pp.798-805 SeptembedOctober 1999 9 A Gyenesei 223A fuvy approach for mining quantitative association rules,\224 TUCS Technical Report no 336 March 2000 IO B Liu W Hsu and Y Ma 223Mining association rules with multiple minimum supports,\224 Prm Fifth ACM SIGKDD Int Con Knowledge Discovery ondDoto Mining pp.125-134 Sept 1999 Ill H Mannila H Toivancn and A Verkama 223Efficient algorithm far discovering association rules,\224 Knowledge DiFcovery in Datobues pp.181-192 Sept. 1994 I21 E.H Mamdani and S Assilian 223An experiment in linguistic synthesis with a fuzzy logic control,\224 International Journol of Man-Machine Studies,vol 7 no l,pp.l-l3 1975 I31 A Savasere, E.

 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simplied to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no benet to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are dened over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
