  1 Investigating the Effects of Atmospheric Seeing on the Detection of near Earth Orbiting Asteroids Capt. Anthony P. O\222Dell and Stephen C. Cain Air Force Institute of Technology Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 80305 937-255-3636 Anthony.odell@afit.edu  Abstract 227Computer simulations are used to compare the results of correlating a simulated image of an asteroid with a point spread function while varying the atmospheric parameter 12 The images contain a point source object that is smeared due to the atmosphere. The point spread function is calculated using r 0 since r 
0 can be measured at the time of time of data collection.  Thes e results are evaluated against an uncorrelated threshold detection algorithm using the same data input. The re sulting receiver operating characteristic \(ROC\show the effects of the different atmospheres on detection of different sized Near Earth Objects \(NEOs\for both the correlation and threshold algorithm. These results are discussed and compared Recommendations are made for applying these algorithms in the search for NEOs T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1

directly related to their size The dangers these objects pose prompted NASA to form a NEO Science Definition Team This team produced a report on August 22, 2003 that described and quantified the im pact these NEOs would have on Earth and its populace. The report called for cataloguing 90% of NEOs over 140 meters in size. Part of this recommendation was carried out in the form of the Spaceguard project. The Spacegua rd project searches for NEOs above 1 kilometer \(km\ in size.  NEOs over 1 km are considered extinction events. This search is nearly complete 1  1 U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright 2 
IEEEAC paper #1581, Version 5, Updated October 30, 2008 at the time of this paper\222s submissi  Although they may not be globally catastrophic, NEOs smaller than 1 km in diameter can cause massive regional damage such as the Tunguska air blast event of 1908 estimated to be 50-100 meters in diameter. These smaller 1km, NEOs are more numerous than the larger, > 1km NEOs and create more difficu lt detection issues. Due to their smaller size, their visual magnitudes should be larger making them harder to detect. Being more numerous and harder to detect than larger NEOs, it may be necessary to make more scans of the sky than were necessary for the Spaceguard project 
In order to address these issues it is necessary to readdress detection techniques. Seve ral techniques have been described in other research infrared satellites, space-based optical telescopes, and large \(greater than 1 meter based optical telescopes. Most of these have costs in the tens or hundreds of millions and use standard threshold techni  In this paper, a matched filter technique is described for using ground-based telescopes to detect NEOs and MatLab code is used to simulate this process 2  B ACKGROUND  Spaceguard The search for large NEOs has been conducted using both 
space and ground based large telescopes \(greater than 1 m in diameter\their searches they used resolutions greater then Nyquist thereby creating a liasing.  They use diffraction limited resolution which is referred to as Rayleigh resolution. This aliasing allows them to typically collect the majority of the photons from the NEO into one pixel and therefore by-pass the effects of the atmospheric seeing Aliasing does increase the pixel background and the noise per pixel. With most of the phot ons in one pixel, no filter is necessary and a straight-forward threshold detector can be used. The NEO Report uses a threshold of 6 standard deviations of the background noise or a signal-to-noise ratio SNR   
 


  2 Atmospheric Seeing Light from NEOs reach our at mosphere and are obscured and spread by turbulence in the layers of our atmosphere This turbulence results in the photons from the NEOs spread out spatially. This sp atial spread decreases the resolution possible. The resu lting shape of the image is changed from a point source to a circular image whose size is dependent on the turbulence in the atmosphere. The intensity of the image decr eases with distance from the center of the image. The turbul ence is parameterized by the seeing parameter, r0 Different locations have differe nt atmospheric seeing values and those values change over the course of time during the day and night. Locations with higher altitudes tend to have better atmospheric seeing parameters. The atmospheric seeing parameter can have values of 1 to 20 cm. Satellites such as the Hubble Space Tele scope, are not hindered by atmospheric seeing and therefore have better resolution but costs are dramatically increased over ground-based telescopes Point Spread Function \(PSF\ Matched Filter The turbulence affect described above results in the NEO\222s point source being spread in to a circular shape. This is referred to as the point spread function \(psf\s determined either by the telescope diameter or the atmospheric seeing parameter, which ever aperature is smallest. The photons from the NEO are distributed by this psf. Since the diameter of the telescope is known and r0 can be measured at the time of data collection, the psf can be calculated In a best case scenario, the NEO will be in the center of a pixel in the ccd and create the images shown below in Figure 1, Rayleigh resolution, and Figure 2, Nyquist resolution, which will be described in detail in Section 3 The photon distribution is greater in the Nyquist image due to its greater resolution which means fewer photons per pixel but a better defined psf For the best case scenario, the number of photons concentrated in one pixel of the Rayleigh psf is 61 percent for a seeing of 14. For a seeing parameter of 5 cm, the photon concentration decreases to 15 percent. For a seeing parameter of 20 cm, the percentage increases to 75 percent The number of photons concentrated in one pixel of the Nyquist psf is 19 percent for a seeing of 14. For a seeing parameter of 5 cm, the photon concentration decreases to 2.5 percent. For a seeing parameter of 20 cm, the percentage increases to 34 percent  Figure 1 \226 Rayleigh resolution PSF with seeing of 14 cm with source in center of pixel \(65, 65  Figure 2 \226 Nyquist resolution PSF with seeing of 14 cm with source in center of pixel \(65, 65 In the worst case scenario, the NEO will be in the corner of a pixel and therefore distribute its photons equally among four pixels and create a much broader psf. Figure 3 Rayleigh resolution, and Figure 4, Nyquist resolution, show the resulting images from the psf. The Nyquist resolution shows a better defined psf in this case also For the worst case scenario, the number of photons concentrated in one pixel of the Rayleigh psf is 30 percent for a seeing of 14. For a seeing parameter of 5 cm, the photon concentration decreases to 11 percent. For a seeing parameter of 20 cm, the percentage increases to 34 percent The number of photons concentrated in one pixel of the Nyquist psf is 14 percent for a seeing of 14. For a seeing parameter of 5 cm, the photon concentration decreases to 2.4 percent. For a seeing parameter of 20 cm, the percentage increases to 20.5 percent

This is possible by using the psf and a calculated estimate of the photon intensity of the object you are looking for. For NEO searches, the appropriate photon intensity should be from a 140 meter NEO since that is the limiting diameter we are looking for and larger NEOs will be easier to detect. The distance to the NEO is a more difficult assumption. This calculated psf is then correlated against the ccd image from the telescope. The result will be an image where the source is preserved but the surrounding background noise is reduced since the background noise will not correlate well with the psf. This will make it possible to detect dimmer NEOs then previously possible 3  P ROCEDURE  The MatLab computational language was used to simulate the data and perform the algorithms to test the correlation hypothesis The telescope diameter, d, used for these simulations was 1 meter with an area of .785 square meters. An integration time of 1 second is standard for all data sets. 100 background images and 100 images with a NEO source present were generated for each data set for statistical purposes. The number of images was kept lower to allow faster computation A ccd rectangular grid with 128-by-128 pixels was used for all simulations. The quantum e fficiency of the ccd is 66 percent to agree with NEO report simulations. Also, a detection limitation of SNR 6 is used for comparison purposes to the NEO report  Cutoff frequency, f c is given by \(1.1 is the wavelength of visible light, d is the diameter of the telescope, and z i is the number of pixels across the telescope plane  c i d f z

  4 results in more photons from the NEO being contained in fewer pixels for \(6 5\xel angle difference also means more background photons will be collected in the Rayleigh resolution pixels than for Nyquist resolution To compute the number of photons reaching the telescope from the NEO, a visual magnitude approach was used. The baseline for a zero magnitude object is Vega. Vega\222s temperature, 9602 Kelvin, was used to compute the luminosity of the star along with quantizing the visible wave numbers into discrete increments of 1 centimeter from 10000/.7 to 10000/.4, visual band used for these simulations  23 200 1 b hc kT hc L e 
003\327\b 10 The psf used for correlation is created with the NEO source in the center of a pixel unless otherwise stated in the Results Section or in the figure caption. This is regardless of the position of the NEO source used in the creation of the image Using these two correlated matrixes, the image and background, a threshold detection technique can be used to determine if a signal is present. First, the standard deviation of the background must be calculated using the values from the correlated background matrix and the mean of that matrix. With this, the value of the SNR 6 can be computed by multiplying the standard deviation of the correlated background matrix by 6. This value is the threshold for the threshold detector The threshold detector works by comparing each value in both the correlated image and background to the threshold value. Any value above the threshold value is considered a detection. This is considered a positive recognition of a source, the NEO. If the detection is in the background, it is a false alarm and is cataloge d as such. If the detection occurs in the image, it is a positive alarm and is cataloged as such At an SNR 6, the theoretical false alarm rate for each pixel with the matrix is 9.866x10^-10, calculated by \(11  2 6 2 0 2 5 dt 2 t e 
006 003 8 With the number of photons in each packet computed, they are summed together to find the total number of photons in the visible band received fro m Vega. To calculate the number of photons from a NEO with a specific visual magnitude he number of photons calculated for the baseline zero Vega by the following equation  2.512 p hotons 007 9 The same equation is used to calculate the number of photons for the background with a particular visual magnitude The photon number from the NEO is multiplied by the integration time of the exposure. This value is used along with the seeing parameter, r0, the pixel resolution, dx, and the ccd size to create a point spread function. The resulting psf will be a 128-by-128 matrix which represents the ccd The background is created by taking the number of photons calculated from \(2\ultiplying it by the integration time then dividing it by the total number of pixels in the ccd and adding it to each entry in a 128-by-128 matrix that represents the ccd. Due to the pixel angle difference between the two approaches, the Rayleigh resolution will have a background visual magnitude of 19.5 while the Nyquist resolution will have a background visual magnitude of 21.5 The image is created by adding each corresponding entry from the two matrixes together. Noise is introduced by using the \223poissrnd\224 function in MatLab to produce a poisson random variable noise to the data The background per pixel value calculated earlier is now subtracted from the image and the background image To perform the correlation, the Fast Fourier Transform FFT\he image, background, and psf is performed. The FFT of the psf is multiplied by the complex conjugate \(*\f the FFT of the image.

The power for each discrete photon packet is computed by multiplying the luminosity of each packet by the surface area of Vega The power is then spread ove r the surface area of a sphere with the radius of the distance from Earth to Vega. This is the flux that is incident on the 1 meter telescope. The flux is multiplied by the area of the telescope lens, .785 square meters, to find the incident power The incident power of each discr eet packet is divided by the specific power necessary for a photon at that wavelength  1 energy ch 
 


  5 The false alarm rate for the 100 background 128-by-128 matrixes is .001616. This is important to note for comparison versus the simulated false alarm rates given in the Results Section. The theoretical and simulated false alarm rates should be similar An acceptable positive alarm rate is considered to be 90 and above as is stated in the NEO report  4  R ESULTS  Two data sets were simulated for the Rayleigh resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude with a background of 19.5 visual magnitude. One with correlation, one without correlation, and both with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 is shown in figure 5  Figure 5 \226 Rayleigh resolution with and without correlation for a source locate d in the center of pixel The data shows that psf correlation with Rayleigh resolution has some benefit at higher SNRs and is well above the 90 discovery rate specified in the NEO report. The correlation technique gives it\222s best improvement as the SNR increases to 6 where it gives close to a 10 percent increase in detection probability Two data sets were simulated for the Nyquist resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude with a background of 21.5 visual magnitude. One with correlation, one without correlation and both with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 is shown in figure 6  Figure 6 \226 Nyquist resolution with and without correlation for a source locate d in the center of pixel When Nyquist resolution is used, it is evident from the data that correlation with the psf is necessary to increase the detection rate to just above 70 percent at SNR 6. The detection probability increases to over 90 percent by SNR 5 and reaches 100 percent by SNR 4 Without correlation, using Nyquist causes close to a 40 loss of detection capability when compared to the Rayleigh resolution detection in figure 5. With correlation, the Nyquist resolution detection is less than 10% lower then Rayleigh resolution detection from figure 5 at SNR 6. By SNR 5, the psf correlation of the Nyquist resolution has a higher detection probability then the uncorrelated Rayleigh resolution in figure 5 and continues to have a higher detection probability to SNR 3 Three data sets for the Rayleigh resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude with a background of 19.5 visual magnitude One with correlation, one without correlation, one with correlation from a psf with the source in the corner of the pixel, and all with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 is shown in figure 7  
 


  6  Figure 7 \226 Rayleigh resolution without and with correlation of psf in corner and center of pixel with source in corner of pixel The data shows that correlation with a psf from a center pixel aligned does not improve the detection probability Correlation with a correctly aligned psf does increase the detection probability as shown by the top data line Two data sets were simulated for the Nyquist resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude with a background of 21.5 visual magnitude. One with and one without correlation and both with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 is shown in figure 8  Figure 8 \226 Nyquist with correlation versus Nyquist without correlation for a source in corner of pixel The data shows that a correlation improves detection probability at all SNRs from 6 to 3. The point where the two lines cross is at different SNRs When compared to figure 7, the psf correlated Nyquist resolution detection probability is greater than the Rayleigh resolution threshold detection at all SNRs. As the SNR increase the improvement over the Rayleigh resolution threshold detection increase. At SNR 3, Nyquist resolution detection probability is 100 pe rcent and Rayleigh resolution detection is 80 percent. At SNR 6, Nyquist resolution detection probability is 40 percent and Rayleigh resolution detection is 0 percent Two data sets are shown in figure 9, one with the Nyquist resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude NEO with a background of 21.5 visual magnitude with correlation, and the other has Rayleigh resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude NEO with a background of 19.5 visual magnitude without correlation. A seeing value of 10 cm and telescope optics set for a seeing value of 14 cm. for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 was used for both sets of data  Figure 9 \226 Nyquist resolution correlated with a psf using a seeing parameter of 10 cm and Rayeigh resolution for a seeing of 10 cm. with telescope optics parameter of 14 cm The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation, when nonoptimal telescope parameters are used, shows an improvement over Rayleigh resolution with only threshold detection Figure 10 shows two data sets for a center pixel NEO with a visual magnitude of 20.7. The Rayleigh resolution plot uses a background of 19.5 and the Nyquist resolution plot uses a background of 21.5. The Rayleigh resolution without correlation shows a trend of improvement with increase in atmospheric seeing parameter. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation also shows a trend of improvement with increase in atmospheric seei ng parameter. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation does out perform the Rayleigh resolution without psf correlation for all seeing values. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation is a 2.5 times improvement on detection probability at a seeing value of 10 cm. At a seeing value of 20 cm., Nyquist resolution with correlation is still a 25% improvement over 
 


  7 Rayleigh resolution without correlation  Figure 10 \226 Varying seeing effect on Nyquist resolution with correlation and Rayleigh resolution for source in center of pixel Figure 11 shows two data sets for a NEO in the corner of a pixel with a visual magnitude of 20.7. The Rayleigh resolution plot uses a background of 19.5 and the Nyquist resolution plot uses a background of 21.5. The Rayleigh resolution without correlation shows zero detection rate below a seeing of 15 cm while above 15 cm, the detection rate is less than 10 percent. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation shows a trend of improvement with increase in atmospheric seeing parameter with a detection rate of 75 percent at a seeing of 20 cm. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation does out perform the Rayleigh resolution without psf correlation for all seeing values for a NEO in the corner of a pixel  Figure 11 \226 Varying seeing effect on Nyquist resolution with correlation and Rayleigh resolution for source in corner of pixel 5  C ONCLUSIONS  The psf correlation technique while only slightly better then the threshold detector in th e best case scenario, NEO in center of pixel, is a great improvement over the threshold detector in more difficult scen arios such as NEO close to edge of a pixel and telescope optics not properly aligned for correct seeing at time of data collection These factors make ground-based telescopes a viable option for detecting NEOs of 140 meters and larger by incorporating the psf correlation technique at Nyquist resolution; thereby, saving money versus using expensive space-based telescopes. Also ground-based telescopes are more numerous and multiple ground-based telescopes can scan more sky than one sp ace-based telescope. Multiple ground-based sites can be used for statistical purposes of im ground-based images can be averaged to reduce the background noise thereby, increases detecti on probability. Also, space-based telescopes are more difficult to acquire time, so groundbased telescopes are a more viable option for NEO detection Space telescopes incur significant costs and expensive maintenance and can have long down times waiting for maintenance. If the correlation process described in this paper were used for ground-base d telescopes, cost-savings could be significant while detection capabilities would only be slightly impacted The NEO report uses Rayleigh resolution in order to increase the number of NEO photons within one pixel to increase detection probability using a threshold detector The psf correlation process uses the Nyquist resolution to allow for better definition of the psf within the image. This spreads the NEO photons over more pixels, but the psf correlation process allows for better detection than the NEO report process For ground-based telescopes, elevation is important for the best seeing parameters as mentioned in Section 2. Using the psf correlation can limit the impact of lower elevations on the detection capabilities of a telescope, but not eliminate the detriment of lower elevation. It is still in the best interest of NEO detection to use the highest elevations possible with the best seeing parameters, but where cost prohibits the acquisition of higher elevation this process can help limit the impact The false alarm rate is minimal at SNR 6 as was computed in by equation \(11\ reducing to a SNR 5 would increase the false alarm rate only s lightly and the increase in detection capability will greatly outweigh the false alarm rate increase. Figures 5 through 8 show a great improvement from SNR 6, the far left of each graph, to SNR 5. The improvement is typically 2 times better detection probability. The psf correlation process improves 
 


  8 the detection capabilities for NEOs. The psf correlation process exceeds the NEO reports requirement of 90 detection of NEOs with a visual magnitude of 20.7. It could also detect a majority of NEOs over 50 meters The psf correlation process will require significant computational time and resources. This can be overcome by segmenting the images to be correlated and distributing them to several processers. This is a significant difference between the psf correlation process and the standard threshold detection process used today. The computational intensity of this process can be handled by most mainframes Movement of the NEO within the image from pixel to pixel during exposure is an issue for both the NEO report process and the process described in this paper. Integration must be long enough to allow for enough photons for detection, but not so long as to allow the NEO to move into another pixel thereby distributing it\222s photons into more pixels while the background intensity increases 6  C ONCLUSION  Nyquist resolution with psf correlation has been shown to be less affected by the atmo spheric seeing parameter than just using a threshold detector alone. Using a psf correlation technique for Nyquist resolution images has been shown to increase the probability to discover NEOs over the current aliasing and threshold technique in all situations addressed in this paper A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  The opinions and views expressed by the authors are not necessarily those of the Department of Defense or the United States Air Force R EFERENCES  1] Near-Earth Object Science Definition Team Study to Determine the Feasibility of Extending the Search for Near-Earth Objects to Smaller Limiting Diameters  August 22, 2003 2] E.

she performs requests, she does not explicitly make her role as the leader explicitly relevant. Rather, she compensate for the request by using positive politeness strategies. This corresponds with Mullany \(2004\d the findings in the çLanguage in the Workplace projecté [20, 26 By  u s i ng closeness strategies, the Agenda-leader presupposes common ground and familiarity, something which makes her appear as an egalitarian leader who trusts her team members and encourages them to act independently Despite the fact that the leader of Agenda by linguistic form appears as egalitarian and present in in-group communication she constitutes herself more as an authority towards externally co-workers When writing messages to out-group partners, she tends to use a more formal style. When performing requests, she uses more direct strategies and ground the requesting acts in her position as a leader, or refers to super-ordinates. By referring to hierarchical roles, she is making power categories overtly relevant. This may be an effective device to pursue a quick compliance to a request. Second, the Agenda-leader makes hierarchical categories explicitly relevant when managing conflicts This study has primarily shown that the Agenda-leader does not make hierarchical categories relevant when writing messages to the team-members. Her authority is downplayed, or back grounded, in favor of an emotional, personal relationship with her employees. These findings illustrate Fairhurstês point that hierarchy categorizations often are unspok h e Agenda-leader Line Myhre does not need to explicitly qualify herself as a leader each time she posts a request. Her appointed role as the leader of Agenda gives her an exclusive right to perform requests and the members are obliged to comply. In addition, the institutional role is enacted implicitly by the rhetorical devices identified in this study Her leadership role is constituted by and through the actions which she performs. Evaluating motivating and requesting are leadership actions 36  W h e n Li ne M yhr e p o s ts me ssa ge s to o u t group co-workers, she does not have the same exclusive right, or can not take for granted that the recipients will comply with her requests, since she is not their leader. Therefore, the requests need to be grounded in her institu tional role, or anchored in her super-ordinateês wish 5.2 Doing leadership is building trust The leadership carried out in Agenda seems to a great extent to be grounded on trust. In the present article, this has been exemplified by the addressing devices, the nick names, and the leaderês use of positive politeness when performing requests A characteristic of virtual teams and computermediated networks is that çboundaries are permeable, interactions are with diverse others connections switch between multiple networks, and hierarchies can be flatter and recursive \(É\he community exists more in the informal networks than predefined work-groups. Rather than fitting into the same group as those around them, each person has his/her own çpersonal communityé [37   Wellman \(2001\ers to this phenomenon as networked individualism ris k  w i t h t h e  networked individualism is that the social life at the work place may be fragmented, and that no one fully knows each other Where person-to person community is individualizing, role-to-role community deconstructs a holistic individual identity A person becomes only the sum of her roles, and there is the danger of alienation The compartmentalization of personal life within the household and within the community Ö may create an insecure milieu where no one fully knows anyone Wellman 2001:17 The leadership practices carried out in Agenda which is grounded on trust, may demonstrate an attempt to reduce these risks As mentioned in the review, one of the challenges for leaders of virtual teams is to duplicate the two key functional leader roles to the virtual team \(team development and performance management\ According to Bell and Kozlowski [6  this includes the leaders need to çclosely monitor any changes in environmental conditions Additionally it includes to motivating team members to çcommit strongly to the overall team effort and need to facilitate team coherence especially under high intensity conditionsé. In virtual teams, as in Agenda where people only rarely meet face-to-face, these functions are challenged. However, the leader seems to attempt to create a positive climate in the group, both by rhetorical devices as giving the group a nick-name and by providing receipts and acknowledgements in third position responses. These characteristics belong to the team-development function addition, arranging regular face to face meetings belongs to the performance management function Conclusively, the leader seems to duplicate both of the important leader functions Computer-mediated communication provides great opportunity for leaders to send out important information, request and monitor their members Even though the team-members are physically distant, the technology facilitates constraint-free communication and çhyperconnectivityé, i.e. çthe availability for people to communicate anywhere and anytim ai l  m a y f o s t er s o cial  presence in a greater extent than face-to-face, in the sense that e-mail messages are persistent and thus Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 
 


having more pervasive force. This makes it possible for leaders to appear powerful, even on a distance Interestingly, with respect of the amounts of messages, the reminders and extent of feedback [29  e A g e n da leader appears as a po w e rfu l  leader, displaying her hierarchical position in the group. Simultaneously, her methods of creating in group solidarity and performing requests, shows that her institutional role is back grounded as she enacts egalitarian leadership building socioemotional ties within the team 6.

Ensures that the integrity of the system as a whole does not suffer because of over optimizing any of the smaller pieces 225  Sees multi-view representations of sy stems to understand how the pieces fit together and interact. Visualizes systems in 3-D. Draws a picture in his or her mind, or on paper 225  Is able to look deep enough into a problem without losing focus on the big picture.  Sees the big picture while at the same time demonstrating an overall awareness of the details 225  Breaks the problem down into smaller manageable parts 225  Understands how the system works, what it was designed to do, its functions and 


  14 requirements. Is able to analyze the systems data. Traces implications of a problem in a step-by-step manner across the system Has the Ability to Find Connections and Patterns Across the System 225  Integrates and provides a connection between the various engineering segments of the project.  Is able to identify c onnections from separate elements of the project that others would not notice and brings these connections to the team's attention as a means to assist in solving underlying issues 225  Examines and explores the implications of how technical decisions being made affect the bigger system architecture Sees the ripple effect of changing requirements or making changes to any element of the system 225  Able to see system interfaces. Identifie s the impact that changes to one subsystem are having--or might have--on other sub-systems.  Locates and corrects sub-system 'disconnects' or 'inconsistencies' that are having a negative impact on system performance Sets Priorities 225  Sets technical priorities in order to maintain the balance for the problems at hand while achieving system requirements Keeps the Focus on Mission Requirements 225  Is focused on developing a system that meets the end-item product objectives and does not lose sight of this while integr ating the pieces of the system into the whole system 225  Studies, understands, and articulates the project\222s overall objectives.  Knows what the system must do and be in order to accomplish its objectives 225  Sets technical priorities with principal investigator and subsystem engineers to achieve system requirements Possesses Creativity and Problem Solving Abilities 225  Enjoys and is energized by fully concentrating on a problem for long stretches until solutions are formed and implemented. Possesses passion for problem solving 225  Takes the initiative to solve the problems 225  Solves problems with the team by listening to the issues, pinpointing problem areas, making technical recommendations; may help implement the solution 225  Does not adhere to rigid rules or formulas for system design, but may create new ideas and approaches that are necessary to deal successfully with system constraints Validates Facts Information and Assumptions 225  Breaks data into smaller pieces or parame ters.  Prioritizes the parameters then synthesizes the data to reach an answer or solution by examin ing system and subsystem operations in minute detail.  Recognizing that seemingly minor miscalculations can lead to signifi cant problems in system performance 225  Questions all assumptions that go into the design 225  Looks for, and anticipates, problems or issu es in the system in places that may not be covered with the right kind of data to make a decision 225  Looks for answers that may not be readily apparent from just looking at the data alone.  Does not rely solely on data Remains Open Minded and Objective 225  Receptive to hearing diverse varying opinions.  Is willi ng to re-think/re-work an issue or to change direction when new information or a better idea is presented 225  Evaluates decisions objectively.  Maintains flexibility by avoiding 'ownership' of a particular strategy or point of view Draws on Past Experiences 225  Draws from his or her hands-on experiences to develop the proper feel for succeeding on future projects, knowing when something looks "ri ght" versus "not even close\223 from past successes and failures 225  Solves problems with a balance of innovative developments and proven heritage products.  May rely on experience and ex isting design as guides, but sees each opportunity as a canvas to design new solutions 225  Uses experience, history, intuition, and se nsing in order to assess the situation and develop a solution Manages Risk 225  Uses past experiences to anticipate pot ential problems that may impact system performance 225  Identifies the key indicators and methods of testing for each type of problem 


  15 225  Develops mitigation strategi es for addressing the problems, should they arise 225  Is risk savvy. Understands that risk is perpetual and needs to be managed  Table 10 Technical Acumen Theme, Competencies and Behaviors Middle Competencies Actual Behaviors Possesses Technical Competence and Has Comprehensive Previous Experience 225  Shares his or her project experience, a nd acts as a reliable resource to the team and serves as the \221go to\222 person 225  Demonstrates the depth of technical knowledge and expertise necessary to perform, manage, and coordinate work-related activities 225  Possesses a strong, fundamental understanding of engineering principles along with a cross-disciplinary background 225  Engages specialists for their t echnical knowledge and abilities 225  Demonstrates ability to focus on details while keeping the big picture in mind.
