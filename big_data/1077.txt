LASA LOW-ENERGY ADAPTIVE SLOT ALLOCATION SCHEDULING ALGORITHM FOR WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS Sattar Hussain Amir Sepasi Zahmati and Xavier Fernando Senior Member IEEE Dept of Elect and Comp Engineering Ryerson University Toronto Canada ABSTRACT The wide range of wireless sensor network WSN applications makes it necessary to design MAC protocols that not only save energy and extend network life but also improve network throughput bandwidth utilization and latency performance In this paper we propose LASA Low-energy 
Adaptive Slot Allocation to replace the 002x slot size in classical Time Division Multiple Access TDMA schemes by a variable slot size that dynamically adapts to the data size generated at sensor nodes The proposed scheme eliminates slot idle time when nodes remain unnecessarily active with no data to transmit or receive This approach outperforms the static slot size TDMA scheme especially when there is a high traf\002c 003uctuation and a big variance in the sensor data length Our results show that this scheme signi\002cantly enhances network throughput reduces bandwidth utilization saves energy and extends network lifetime 
Keywords Wireless Sensor Network WSN  MAC  TDMA CSMA Energy-Ef\002cient 1 INTRODUCTION Wireless sensor networks can be deployed for a wide range of applications These networks use small inexpensive batterypowered sensors with low-power radio electronic systems In most cases these sensors are left unattended in a hostile environment which makes it dif\002cult to recharge or replace their batteries In addition these networks are challenged by the limited bandwidth assigned to their applications Therefore energy consumption and communication band 
width are the two main challenges in the design of WSN Energy consumption comes from transmitting/receiving data processing query requests and forwarding queries/data to neighboring nodes Ener gy is also consumed due to idle listening to the channel overhearing and generating/handling control packets On the other hand the bandwidth provided by sensor nodes is very low 10-250 Kbps Although WSN may need a fraction of this bandwidth in certain application the huge number of sensors deployed and the large volume of traf\002c generated in some other applications raise the concern about bandwidth limitation Moreover in delay sensitive 
applications throughput and latency become another critical factors in WSN operation One of the most energy-ef\002cient techniques is to organize nodes into clusters Clustering allows nodes to perform some functionality on a local scale that would consume too much energy on a global scale It is a completely distributed technique where each node independently makes its decisions based on local information without any centralized control Cluster formation is di vided into rounds of tw o phases a setup phase and a steady-state phase To start a new round nodes are synchronized to a common clock reference 
Then cluster heads are elected based on one or more network metrics such as node ID node degree residual energy communication cost load balance etc The elected cluster heads send short advertisement messages to let other nodes know that they have been elected as a cluster head for the current transmission cycle Once a sensor node receives a cluster head announcement it sends a cluster join message to inform the selected cluster head Signal strength known from received advertisement messages or any other metrics can be used as a criteria to select one of the available cluster heads In the steady state phase cluster heads coordinate the sen 
sor node access to the shared medium A cluster head acts as a local coordinator that schedules channel access to cluster members collects data from sensor nodes fuses the collected data if possible and forwards aggregated messages to the base station BS Obviously being a cluster head leads to more energy consumption Therefore the cluster head will drain its battery quickly if the headship is not rotated among different nodes Rotation of cluster headship can distribute energy load evenly in the network and prevent over-utilization of any node and prolong the network lifetime The rotation can be done randomly 
In sensor networks designing an energy-ef\002cient MAC protocol is another way to maximize network lifetime and improve network latency bandwidth utilization and throughput performance TDMA schedule is used to coordinate the access of cluster nodes to the common transmission channel in most MAC protocols Normally a cluster head computes the TDMA schedule and broadcasts it to all sensor nodes in its control Such schedule is necessary to avoid any collisions or message retransmissions and consequently reduces 
 


o verall energy consumption Thus for scheduled TDMA approaches the steady state phase is broken into slotted frames where each node is given a transmission slot and remains either in a sleep or a low power mode for the rest of the frame awaiting for its next transmission turn When nodes are assumed to have enough data to 002ll their transmission slots entirely the transmission channel will always be busy sending useful information and the system bandwidth will be utilized ef\002ciently Most of the proposed cluster-based schemes are making this assumption Unfortunately this is not the case in practice since the nodes may not necessarily have enough data to 002ll their slots Therefore a considerable amount of bandwidth is wasted in the waiting time of each node To alleviate this problem we introduce LASA that dynamically resizes the allocated slots to match the data size at each node The idea is to eliminate the unusable waiting time and utilize channel bandwidth more ef\002ciently The rest of the paper is organized as follows In section 2 we present the related works in this area Section 3 introduces the clustering algorithm's setup and steady-state phases Performance evaluation is given in section 4 Finally we conclude our work in section 5 2 RELATED WORK Limited energy resources provide the primary constraint for sensor network protocol design Other design constraints such as fairness latency throughput and bandwidth utilization appear for speci\002c applications and some MAC protocols are designed with these constraints In Heinzelman et al proposed the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy LEACH protocol LEACH is a self-organizing adaptive clustering protocol that uses randomization to distribute the energy load evenly among all sensors in the network LEACH is an application speci\002c protocol that combines clustering and data fusion to save energy The protocol implements a TDMA schedule to coordinate nodes access to the available channel Authors in proposed an adapti v e and distrib uted clustering scheme ADCS that can work with both uniformly and non-uniformly dispersed sensors Their approach elects nodes with comparatively more residual energy and more neighbors as a cluster heads The rest of nodes chose to join in a cluster considering both distance and load balance Melodia et al  investigated the relation between energy of routing tasks and the extension of topology knowledge range for each node in A wider topology kno wledge may improve energy ef\002ciency of the routing tasks but increases the cost of topology information due to signaling packets required to have such wider knowledge Authors used integer linear programming to determine the optimal topology knowledge range for each node to make energy-ef\002cient geographical routing decisions In Bolian Y in et al  proposed an energy consumption model to investigate the optimal transmission range in clustered wireless sensor networks Authors used this model to estimate the energy consumption based on network deployment parameters traf\002c pattern and energy model The presented work considers the cluster methods that generate a connecting dominating set CDS CDS is widely used in wireless sensor networks for topology control routing and broadcasting The accuracy of the model is veri\002ed by simulations under various network con\002guration Results obtained indicate that traf\002c load has much greater impact on the optimal range than nodes density Youssef et al proposed the Multi-hop Overlapping Clustering Algorithm MOCA in MOCA is a scalable randomized distributed algorithm for organizing nodes in overlapping clusters Having an overlapping cluster is bene\002cial in node localization ensuring inter-cluster connectivity and boosting the network robustness against cluster head failure The reported results indicate that MOCA is scalable in terms of communication overheads and achieves high node coverage In authors propose a no v el hierarchical routing protocol called Ef\002cient Power Management Protocol with Limited Cluster Size EPMPLCS which limits the size of clusters and avoids large energy consumption among cluster-heads and distant members in big clusters thus prolongs the network's lifetime In addition EPMPLCS supports the assumption that the data of different sensors in one cluster are highly correlated In authors proposed the Hybrid Ener gy-Ef 002cient Distributed HEED protocol HEED periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of their residual energy and communication cost HEED dose not make any assumptions about the distribution or density of nodes or locationawareness As is the case with LEACH HEED terminates in a constant number of iterations The protocol calculates the cluster range or radius using the transmission power level to determine the communication cost HEED also relies on TDMA as a media access control at the transmission phase The MAC protocol proposed in presents a frame w ork that encompasses network organization and routing protocols A collision-free TDMA access implemented along with a multi-hop tree-based routing scheme The work aims to reduce the number of control packets and save energy and computation cost In authors proposed a self-con\002guration and hierarchical protocol that constructs cluster members The sensors in this work can vote for their neighbors in order to elect suitable cluster heads Ergen et al  proposed a TDMA scheme that extends the common single hop TDMA to a multi-hop sensor network using a high powered access point to synchronize the nodes and schedule their transmissions and receptions The authors assume that the sink can reach all the nodes A Carrier Sense Multiple Access CSMA approach is used to avoid collisions Another way of combining CSMA with TDMA is presented in In this w ork the 
 


node only needs to wake up in its own time slot to check for incoming traf\002c instead of every slot as with classical senderbased schemes The protocol proposed in assigns TDMA slots to different groups of sensor nodes so that collisions among groups do not occur Based on the network topology this Group TDMA approach organizes nodes so that communications from different groups do not interfere The protocol divides the channel into spatial dimensions so that overall channel utilization is improved Ye et al proposed an e xtension to his S-MAC protocol that combine overhearing avoidance message passing and low-duty cycle achieved by periodic sleeping to obtain signi\002cant energy saving The adaptive listening approach implemented there largely reduces the cost of energy saving in S-MAC It enables each node to adaptively switch modes according to the traf\002c in the network 3 CLUSTERING ALGORITHM 3.1 Setup Phase Assuming N is the total number of nodes in the network the goal of clustering is to 002nd m local clusters in each cluster formation round so that each node v i  1 267 i 267 N  will be either a cluster head or a non-cluster head For cluster head selection the same criteria used in LEACH protocol will be implemented here However we propose a new TDMA schedule in the steady state phase to achieve better performance in term of energy saving bandwidth utilization throughput and latency Readers are encouraged to refer to for assumptions and other details The decision for each node to become a cluster head depends on a priori determined percentage of cluster heads and the number of times the node has been a cluster head so far After N=m rounds all node expected to have been a cluster head once and a non-cluster head for N=m 241 1 times And the probability for node v i to be a cluster head in the current round r which starts at time t will be P t i   m N 241 m 244  r mod N m  if G t i  1  0 if G t i  0  1 where G t i is an indicator for the node being a cluster head in the most recent rounds  G t i  0 if node v i has been a cluster head and 1 otherwise Implementing of this algorithm in the way speci\002ed earlier requires knowledge of the total number of nodes,N and the predetermined percentage of cluster head m=N  Once the sensor node receives the advertisement messages from the elected cluster heads it replies back with a cluster join message to inform the selected cluster head its membership Each node selects one cluster head that requires the lowest energy for communications based on the signal strength known from the advertisement messages sent by all the elected cluster heads Once the cluster formed the cluster head computes the TDMA schedule and distributes it to all nodes it controls A synchronizing signal is required to ensure all nodes are time synchronized and to start the set up phase at the same time 3.2 Steady-State Phase In the steady state phase each node awaits its allocated slot to start the transmission of data LEACH as the case of static slot TDMA protocols uses a static 002x slot size where all nodes are given the same transmission window regardless of traf\002c volume generated at each node data buffer occupancy  So the frame size will depend only on how many nodes are associated with in the cluster The basic assumption in such protocols is that all nodes have always data to send and to assign the same data length queue to all nodes Unfortunately this is not the case in many WSN applications where nodes may generate data at different rates Therefore these algorithms cannot adapt to the instantaneous sensor nodes demands and traf\002c 003uctuations  In fact the wide variety of proposed applications for sensor networks provides a challenge for protocol design because each application may produce traf\002c with different characteristics and requires dramatically different performance metrics Hence trading of f throughput latency and bandwidth utilization with energy ef\002cient algorithm may not be the right choice in all applications Designing a protocol that maintains high performance in these metrics as well as ef\002cient energy consumption is the main goal of this paper To address this problem we propose a dynamic slot structure for the TDMA allocation scheme  In our scheme the time slot is adaptively allocated according to the instantaneous traf\002c load at each sensor node Hence slots will no longer have the same size and the frame size will vary according to the number of nodes associated with the cluster and the slot size allocated for each node Basically adaptive slot allocation limits most of the drawbacks of the 002xed slot size structure For example if there is big traf\002c 003uctuations associated with the generated data a 002x slot size tuned for high traf\002c loads results in energy waste at low traf\002c or no traf\002c to transmit The energy waste comes as a result of nodes that remain active without data to be transmitted and their transceiver set to the transmission power and also due to cluster head idle listening listening to an idle channel to receive possible traf\002c The latter idle listening is one of the main sources of energy dissipation in WSN In addition a considerable amount of bandwidth is wasted due to time slots not being 002lled to capacity at light loads which means the channel bandwidth being under-utilized  On the other hand if the slot size is tuned for the low traf\002c load low throughput and high latency will result under high traf\002c load conditions Thus adapting the slot size to the data queue at each node will free the application from the burden of selecting an appropriate slot size and limit the classical TDMA problems associated to 002x slot size 
 


The proposed TDMA scheduling built on a control message 224 request 224 that is used by a cluster node to report the number of bytes to be transmitted in the next transmission frame The request depends on the buffer occupancy or the data queue size at the moment sensor node sends its request message To eliminate the need for extra overhead traf\002c the request message will be embedded in the end of the join message The message expected to be no longer than two bytes and has almost negligible in\003uence in protocol performance To compute new TDMA schedule a cluster head needs to collect all the requests from nodes associated with its cluster Typically by the end of each set up phase the cluster head must 002nish recognizing all its cluster's members and collecting their individual requests Based on these collected requests the cluster head computes the new allocation scheme In order to eliminate the computation time and avoid channel idle time the proposed scheme starts an early allocation mechanism where cluster head starts computation of slot allocation of already received requests while still receiving other join messages So when the last message is received the cluster head needs to add this request to the scheduled allocation before broadcasting the complete schedule to all cluster's members If the steady state phase involves transmission of multiple TDMA frames the node will send the request message at the end of its data transmission window In this case nodes need to wake up at the beginning of each transmission cycle to receive the new schedule As in the case of the classical TDMA schedule a synchronizing signal is required to ensure all nodes are time synchronized and start the set up phase at the same time Adaptive slot allocation mechanism is shown in Fig 1 Fig  1  Adaptive slot allocation for TDMA schedule Basically a node with no data to transmit will send a zero request to the cluster head Thus in the next schedule the node will be granted a very short time slot just to send its new request Also during steady state operation a sensor node may become disconnected either due to failure or battery drainage Therefore the cluster head will not receive any request from this node and consequently it is not considered for the next schedule Finally to avoid inter-cluster interference each cluster may communicate using different CDMA codes So the node elected as a cluster head randomly selects a code from a list of spreading codes to be used by all cluster members as the cluster's unique communication code 4 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this work the free space  d 2 power loss channel model is used for a small transmission range less than a threshold distance d o  d  do  while the fading  d 4 power loss channel model is used when the distance between transmitter and receiver is d  do  Hence a po wer control can be used to set the transmission power of each node according to the implemented model i.e according to the distance between the source node and the destination node Therefore to transmit a k bit message a distance d  the energy consumption is E T X   kE elec  kE f sc d 2 if d  d o  kE elec  kE mpc d 4 if d 270 d o  2 and the energy consumption to receive this message is E RX  kE elec  kE DF 3 where E elec is the energy dissipated at the radio electronics E DF  is the energy required for data aggregation E f sc and E mpc are radio ampli\002er energies for free space and multi path fading channel respectively Table 1 illustrates all the parameters used in experiment setup Table 1  Simulation parameters P arameter V alue Netw ork size 100 m x 100 m Sink location 0,-100 Static TDMA slot size 500 bytes Recei ved power threshold 6.3 nW E el ec 50 nJ bit E D F 5 nJ bit Bit rate R b 1 Mbps Threshold distance d o 87 m Idle power 0.05 Watts Ampli\002er Energy E f sc 10 pJ bit=m 2 E mpc 0.0013 pJ bit=m 4 Initial energy 2 J P acket header size 25 bytes W e assume 100 sensor nodes deployed in the network The minimum probability for becoming a cluster head is set to 0.05 Data is generated with a random queue size at each sensor node and upper bounded by the static slot size 500 bytes For the static slot allocation the time slot is 002xed at 4000 R b  4 ms  While for adaptive slot allocation each slot will assigned a variable time window determined by the size of the data generated at the node  For fair comparison the data size is considered for both approaches for energy consumption calculations  Thus in each transmission cycle frame 
 


we have a 002lled to capacity variable-size slots in the adaptive TDMA scheme and partially 002lled 002xed-size slots in the static TDMA scheme Fig 2 shows the total number of frames received at the BS over time It is clear from this 002gure that the adaptive slot allocation scheme results in more frames transmitted to BS compared to the static slot allocation scheme This advantage comes from the adaptation of slot size to the data queue in each node and removing the excess time resulted from slots not being 002lled to their capacity at light loads as the case in static slot allocation In other words frames length will be adapted to the data queues and more frames can be transmitted over time Consequently network throughput is improved and the data waiting time at node buffers latency is reduced as frames become shorter and transmission cycles come more often Fig  2  Number of received frames at the BS over time Fig.3 indicates how the number of frame received at BS per one round can be varied with the data queue generated at the sensor node As shown more frames are transmitted to BS in adaptive slot allocation as data size becomes shorter while the number of transmitted frames remains almost constant in the static slot allocation Fig 4 shows that with the adaptive slot allocation channel bandwidth will be used more ef\002ciently The result shown indicates that more than 90 of the bandwidth is utilized at high and medium loads This result is expected as the adaptive slot allocation eliminates the channel idle times resulted from slots not being 002lled to their capacity However at a very light loads below 10 TDMA schedules are required to be sent more often due to frames become very short resulting in more bandwidth waste Limiting the slot size to a lower bound may mitigate this problem Despite the energy dissipated due to the extra traf\002c required for sending TDMA schedules the adaptive slot allocation scheme saves more energy by eliminating the time the nodes remain active without data to transmit and also by eliminating channel idle listening Fig 5 shows the percentage of wasted energy to the overall energy dissipation in both schemes Results indicate that energy saved by eliminating idle time is more than that wasted by sending more TDMA schedules Hence the sensor network sends more frame to the base station before the last node has its battery drained as Fig  3  Number of received frames vs data size Fig  4  Bandwidth utilization vs data size shown in 002g 6 Fig 7 indicates how the percentage of wasted energy to the overall energy dissipation varies as traf\002c loads and network dimensions change It is obvious that for load of 0  4  less than 5 still can be achieved when the network diameter increases to 200 meters Fig  5  Percent of wasted energy to overall energy dissipation 5 CONCLUSION This work proposes a new TDMA scheme where time slots adapt dynamically to the size of the data generated at sensor nodes The main goal of this scheme is to reduce the time the nodes unnecessarily remain active with no data to transmit or receive Our work is compared to the classical static slot TDMA scheme and the results obtained indicate that this

They are sparse schemas that support the design of the data exchanges needed for employing AGI mission modeling capabilities The sparse schema is used for the first prototyping steps The schema will be brought in to compliance with the SPS Implementation Specification in the final steps of prototyping SpacecraftCapabilities The Spacecraft Capabilities Reque st schema, illustrated in Figure 6, consists of Country and Payload Type elements These are the elements define d in the spacecraft schema\222s Spacecraft Classification and Pa yload Operations elements If the User does not specify a country, the search will include all countries.  The Payload Type can be Optical Imager or Radar Imager.  If a Payload Type is not specified the search will include both imagers The User populates the Spacecraft Capabilities Request XML document and sends it to the PoC-SPS where it is received and parsed.  The PoC-SPS searches and retrieves Spacecraft Classification and Pa yload Operation data from the SOC, populates the Sp acecraft Capabilities Response XML document, and sends it to the User AcquisitionFeasibility The User receives and pars es the Spacecraft Capabilities Response XML document and selects the applicable spacecraft and imaging payloads.  The User populates the Acquisition Feasibility Request XML document and sends it to the PoC-SPS where it is received and parsed The Acquisition Feasibility Request schema, illustrated in Figure 6, contains Spacecraft Pa yload Pairing, Feature of Interest, and Acquisition Constraints The request also includes the radar scan mode from Radar Payload Operation element if th e imager is a Radar Imager A Feature of Interest is defined by a ground point A full set of acquisition constraints includes geometric temporal, environmental, and quality. Examples of acquisition constraints for an Op tical Imager are: geometric slant range elevation angle range, temporal - time of day interval, environmental - solar elevation angle range, and quality - ground sample resolution range The PoC-SPS does not incorporate ground sample resolution since it requires knowledge of the detector configuration.  For example, an optical detector would require, at a minimum, detector focal length and pixel width.  However, a User can select an imaging payload based on its ground sample resolution provided in the Spacecraft Capabilities Response XML document The PoC-SPS receives and processes the Acquisition Feasibility Request.  The spacecraft payload pairing is used to retrieve the payload field of regard from the SOC and the spacecraft orbital elements from CelesTrak, the authoritative source of NORAD or bital elements.  Then the AGI Components are activated to determine the Acquisition Feasibility Response The payload field of regard is used instead of the field of view because it corresponds to the in-track and cross-track range that the payload could be pointed The Acquisition Feasibility Response sequence contains a number of acquisition interval start and stop times and corresponding acquis ition geometry The PoC-SPS populates the AcquisitionFeasibilityResponse XML document and provides it to the User The User can request Acquisition Feasibility Responses from a number of potential DPs and select the DP that best satisfies the User needs 6  F IRE S AT S YS ML   AGI  C OMPONENTS I NTERFACE P ROTOTYPING  The interaction between the SPS operations and AGI Components is the basis of the interaction between a FireSat SysML model and AGI Components SysML is a domain-specific modeling language for systems engineering.

   11 The SysML model is of a hypothetical FireSat system - a space-based system for det ecting, identifying, and monitoring forest fires.   It is derived from the description in Space Mission Analysis and Design Third Edition, by Wiley J. Larson and James R. Wertz \(editors modeling is an International Council of Systems Engineering \(INCOSE\odel Based System Engineering MBSE\ilot project One of the goals of the FireSat MBSE pilot project is to develop an interface between the FireSat SysML model and STK/AGI Components The FireSat system consists of users, mission satellites communications satellites, and ground stations.  The SysML model is used to carryout trade studies of system design performance, and cost   The FireSat SysML model is created with MagicDraw 256  from No Magic and uses ParaMagic\231 from InterCAX to carry out trade studies.  Para Magic integrates Microsoft Excel, MATLAB 256 Simulink 256 and Mathematica into MagicDraw SysML models.  InterCAX is prototyping the SysML interface with AGI Components Figure 7 is an overview of how a FireSat SysML model could interact with AGI Components to carry out trade studies on FireSat system elements There are two types of interactions.  The first is a setup of the scenario elements cache c ontaining candidate spacecraft imaging payloads, relays, and ground stations.  These candidate elements are populated from the FireSat system elements pool.  This pool contains all of the FireSat elements and variations under consideration. The second interaction is a series of elements selections, accessibility queries, and coverage queries The accessibility and coverage data returned by AGI Components are used to assess FireSat measures of effectiveness.  Examples ar e area covered, revisit time memory margin, and power margin The accessibility and coverage data are also used to assess FireSat resource usage strategies, e.g 
200  Communication link availability for command uplink telemetry downlink, and image downlink 200  Memory used for image storage versus memory freed up by downlink during and after imaging 200  Power used for image collection and downlink versus power replenished during sunbathing and normal operations The current prototyping of the interaction between the FireSat SysML model and AGI Components is confined to the data exchange interface of Figure 8 200  Scenario Elements Initialization 200  Accessibility Chain Request and Response 200  Feature Coverage Request and Response The spacecraft orbit is modeled w ith the standard set of six orbital elements.  The imaging payload is modeled with rectangular or conic field of view half angles and a direction of pointing in the spacecraft re ference frame.  The field of view is modeled, instead of the field of regard, since it represents the extent of the coverage capability at any instance of time. The field of regard represents the potential coverage Accessibility chains are used to determine time intervals of accessibility through a string of serially linked scenario elements As an example, take a chain consisting of a feature of interest, a mission spacecraft, a relay spacecraft, and a ground station.  The chain capability determines the intervals of time that the missi on spacecraft is in view of the feature of interest and the rela y and, at the same time, the relay is in view of the ground station.  In view means that the lines of sights between th e elements satisfy viewing constraints A feature of interest, an imaging payload on a mission spacecraft, a relay spacecraft, and a ground station chain is more restrictive since line of si ght to the feature of interest must be within the imaging payload field of view. The satellite can image the feature of interest and downlink the image through the relay satellite during these intervals of time The feature of interest can be a point or an area.  An area is defined by a set of latitude, longitude, and altitude vertices connected by straight lines.  The AGI Components coverage capability fills in the area with grid points with a user defined spacing The user also selects among the following figure of merits for area coverage 200  Area covered, i.e. square kilometers 200  Percent of area covered 200  Area covered in each time interval 200  Minimum, maximum, and average response times 200  Minimum, maximum, and average revisit times 
 


   12 The response time is a measure of the time between a request for coverage of an area grid point and the time at which coverage is achieved The revisit time is a measure of the intervals during which coverage of a grid point is not provided, also known as coverage gaps 7  C URRENT S TATUS AND F UTURE P LANS  The SOC is currently populated with Earth observation navigation, communications and technology development spacecraft as well as ground facilities that support spacecraft launch and operations The SOC contains 59 Earth observation satellites from 20 countries.  There are 44 optical imaging satellites with a total of 116 operating modes, and 15 radar imaging satellites with a total of 66 operating modes.  An optical operating mode is a combination of sensor, spectrum projected field of view, and ground resolution.  Examples of radar operation modes are spotlight, stripmap, and scanSAR The schema has been defined for the User - PoC-SPS data exchange of Figure 6 and the Discover Sensors capability has been prototyped as A pplication Programming Interface API\e next step is to prototype all the capabilities as both as API and XML document interfaces Then, the XML document inte rface will be brought into compliance with the SPS Impl ementation Specification The prototyping of FireSat SysML and AGI Components interaction is taking place in geographically separated facilities: AGI in Exton, Pennsylvania and InterCAX in Atlanta, Georgia.  XML documents were exchanged by email during the initial prototyping.  Current prototyping incorporates program-to-program automatic exchange of XML documents, with all the prototyping at InterCAX Future prototyping will include an API passing of data The InterCAX approach to the design and implementation of FireSat SysML model and AGI Components interaction is addressed in reference 2 Figure 7.

   14 The schema has been defined for the FireSat SysML and AGI Components interaction of Figure 8.  The Setup System Elements and Determine Feature Coverage capabilities have been prototyped.  The next step is to prototype all the capabilities as both API and XML document interfaces 8  C ONCLUSIONS  An SPS providing a COTS GetFeasibility operation will make it easier for Users to discover sensors that fulfill their needs.  A COTS common inte rface will provide the User with one well-known set of operations for the initial discovery of candidate sensors A final selection of sensors can be carried out using the SPS operations of the individual DPs Additionally, an SPS server c ontaining a catalog of sensors can be created to provide the Users with one-stop-shopping for the initial discovery of candidate sensors The operations being developed now are for optical and radar sensors, but are extensible to Earth observation scientific sensors The design and implementation of the Magic Draw and ParaMagic FireSat SysML model interaction with AGI Components will be refined a nd then extended to other SysML tools The FireSat SysML model interaction with AGI Components proof of concept is also intended to provide the blueprint for the design and implementation of other types of SysML modeling of space based missions R EFERENCES   Docum e nt 07-014r3 at  http://www.opengeospatial.org   M a nas B a jaj, \223SLIM A C o l l a borat i v e, M odel B a sed Systems Engineering Work space for Next-Generation Complex System\224, 2011 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings, March 5-12, 2011 B IOGRAPHY  Dave Kaslow is Director, Product Data Management at Analytical Graphics, Inc.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
