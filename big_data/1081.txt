of semiconductor devices are required to build a larger SCM array in the real world which prefers a globally asynchronous and locally synchronous GALS design with different clock domains for system extensibility This paper presents the local-and-global stall mechanism LGSM for an SCM array implemented over multiple FPGAs to guarantee the data-synchronization among FPGAs operating at different clocks Prototype implementation with ALTERA Stratix III FPGAs shows that the proposed design does not give a big overhead to operating frequency and hardware resource utilization We also evaluate the scalability of the SCM array over multiple FPGAs considering actual stall cycles 
I I NTRODUCTION Scientiìc simulations such as computational uid dynamics CFD require high-performance computing HPC with oating-point FP operations which are nowadays achieved by the supercomputers composed of a lot of general-purpose microprocessors However several groups of the HPC applications cannot fully bring out the peak performance of the system because of their memory-intensive feature Generalpurpose microprocessors are not designed for such applications with low operational-intensity which is the number of FP operations per data read from the external memory due to cache misses Furthermore lar ge-scale parallel computers 
suffer from the overhead of message passing among nodes resulting in only a fraction of the peak performance of the entire system These inefìcient results are caused by the mismatch between the hardware resources of general-purpose microprocessors and those required for each application Custom computing machines CCMs providing dedicated resources to an individual application is one of the solutions to improve actual performance and achieve scalable performance to the increased hardware resources In recent years there have been reports to build CCMs with FPGAs Field-Programmable Gate Arrays   which ha v e been getting FP performance comparable to or more than the peak performance of microprocessors 
The state-of-the-art FPGAs are still expensive but contain  Corresponding author more DSP blocks and memory blocks in addition to larger logics and higher operating frequency than previous FPGAs Although FPGA-based implementation still has disadvantages in the overheads of area and operating frequency compared to ASIC it is signiìcant that we can easily build CCMs with FPGAs that are already commercial off-the-shelf So far we have proposed the systolic computational memory SCM architecture for high-performance and scalable FP computation based on the nite difference methods 8  The SCM architecture has an array structure of processing 
elements PEs with distributed local memories for scalable arithmetic-performance and internal-bandwidth to the array size In our previous research we showed that a prototyped array over two FPGAs achieves complete scalability to the array size irrespective of the limited inter-FPGA bandwidth  9 W e used a single clock source to be distrib uted to the FPGAs for synchronization however the single-clock distribution becomes difìcult and improper to a larger system with a lot of FPGAs connected For such a larger system multipleclock implementation e.g multiple boards with different clock-domains is feasible and has the advantage of system modularity and extensibility On the other hand multiple 
clock implementation requires an additional mechanism to synchronize parallel execution of computations among devices operating at different clocks In this paper we present a local-and-global stall mechanism LGSM for an SCM array SCMA implemented over multiple FPGAs to synchronize execution and data transfer among FPGAs with different clock-sources Since a sub-array implemented on each FPGA consists of many PEs and several sequencing units sequencers the local-stall mechanism stops the execution of PEs by stalling their sequencer when it detects read-empty or write-full on communication FIFOs Then the global-stall mechanism stops the remaining PEs one cycle after the local stall Through prototype implementation of 
SCMAs by using multiple FPGAs we show that the design with LGSM does not give a big overhead for operating frequency and hardware resource utilization We will evaluate the actual performance degradation due to stall cycles for sub-arrays on multiple FPGAs operating at different clock frequencies and demonstrate that the feasible conìguration ___________________________________ 978-1-4244-8983-1/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE

performance in the SCM architecture Fig.2 also shows the typical conìguration of an SCM array SCMA 8 9 The array has the 2D mesh netw ork where each PE is connected to the four adjacent PEs via communication FIFOs N S Wand E-FIFOs The PE has the oating-point multiply-and-accumulate FMAC unit for the neighboring accumulation with data read from the local memory or the FIFOs The result can be written to the memory and/or sent to the adjacent PEs Each PE in the array belongs to one of the several control groups CGs each of which has a single control unit called a sequencer  For example all the PEs on the left edge except the top and bottom corners of the array belong to the CG 6 in Fig.3 The PEs are controlled by the sequencer of the CG which successively outputs microoperations MOps to them We refer to a sequence of MOps as just a sequence  C Multi-device system To obtain scalable performance we have to implement a larger SCMA than the one tting a single semiconductor device and accordingly use multiple devices for largescale implementation Although the SCM architecture itself is designed for coarse-grain parallelism and synchronization we should consider the problems caused by the multi-device implementation such as the bandwidth problem and the synchronization problem The bandwidth problem arises from difference in available bandwidths for on-chip off-chip but on-board and inter-board data-transfer Typically the highest frequency and the largest number of wires are available on a chip giving the highest bandwidth while off-chip bandwidth is much lower than the on-chip one We further have lower bandwidth for cables between boards For such non-uniformity of bandwidth over multiple devices we homogeneously partition the entire array into sub-arrays each of which be implemented on a device as shown in Fig.2 and introduce the bandwidth reduction mechanism BRM consisting of the bandwidth reduction unit and the expansion unit of Fig.3 between the devices Fig.4 shows the structure of the 4:1 BRM which reduces the interPE bandwidth of 8 PEs into the one-fourth by applying timedivision multiplexing TDM to the net average bandwidth given by explicitly writing data to FIFOs Due to the ratio of communication cycles to computation cycles in neighboring accumulation the net bandwidth is much lower than the localmemory bandwidth of a PE On the other hand a large scale system with a lot of devices have the synchronization problem because of difìculty in distributing a clock source A system synchronized with a single clock-source is the best choice for implementation simplicity However we need an annoying clock distributor for single-clock synchronization As the number of devices increases in a physically larger system it becomes more difìcult to uniformly distribute a clock source to them without skew We can also use a clock chain however a 2D or 3D array of thousands devices requires a too long chain which is impractical In addition these dedicated clock-distributors and clock-chains remarkably reduce modularity and extensibility of the system that should be scaled Based on the discussion we make a choice of globallyasynchronous and locally-synchronous GALS design with multiple clock-domains In the simplest case each device has its independent clock source which is only referred by the directly-connected neighboring devices Thus different devices are globally asynchronous while logics within each device are locally synchronous Multiple clock-domains allow us to easily implement an extensible and scalable system with a lot of devices However it also causes a synchronization problem of execution and data-transfer among devices because clock sources have slight but inevitable difference in frequency For example if we have two clock oscillators for 100MHz they can be different from each other e.g 100.0001MHz and 100.0002MHz Since different frequencies cause different execution speeds we need to introduce some mechanism to logically synchronize PEs operating at different clocks In the next section we present the local-and-global stall mechanism to solve this synchronization problem for the GALS design of

 Read-Empty Detector Read-empty count FIFO-write Readissued Remaining data counter  zero 5 Fig 7 Read-empty detector dual-clock FIFOs DC-FIFOs which have multi-stage synchronizers allowing us to read and write FIFOs at different clocks However we still have to solve the synchronization problem caused by the difference in frequency among FPGAs The inter-PE communication is performed by explicitly executing MOps for communication which send data to the adjacent PEs or read data from the communication FIFOs If all the PEs are synchronized at a single clock we can statically schedule these MOps for adequate communication However if we use different clocks PEs operating at higher frequency can read an empty FIFO before the corresponding datum is written to the FIFO and/or write a full FIFO before the datum is read from the FIFO Therefore we need some hardware mechanism to suspend the PEs in the case of read-empty RE or write-full WF B Local-and-global stall mechanism for control groups For explanation here we assume that an SCM array is implemented over FPGAs A and B as shown in Fig.3 and FPGA A operates at higher frequency than that of FPGA B In this case RE or WF can be performed by the PEs of CGs 2 3 and 9 of FPGA A which are connected to the PEs of FPGA B To avoid RE and WF we need to stall the PEs by suspending their sequencers Once the sequencers of CGs 2 3 and 9 stop the PEs of the other CGs can perform RE or WF Therefore we also have to stall all the sequencers of FPGA A in the end Moreover we should release them from stalling immediately when FIFO-emptiness and/or FIFO-fullness are resolved As the most naive design we can implement such an SCM array that all the sequencers simultaneously stall just after RE or WF are detected However this design is impractical Although each sequencer can stall immediately when locally detecting RE or WF the stall signal takes more than one cycles to be distributed from a sequencer to the other sequencers and make them stall This is because the stall-signal distribution requires at least one OR operation for RE and WF detection long wires with large fan-out and another OR operation to generate the global-stall signal If we implement the stallsignal distribution within one cycle it reduces the operating frequency stall l.stall + g.stall stall = l.stall l.stall == 0 l.stall & g.stall == 1 start MOp execution not delayed d = 0 MOp execution 1-cycle delayed d = 1 Fig 8 State transition diagram of the stall control unit To solve this problem we introduce a local-and-global stall mechanism LGSM to the CGs which is based on the very simple concept that sequencers stall immediately when they detect RE or WF and the others stall several cycles later Fig.5 shows the overview of LGSM Sequencer 2 of CG 2 observes w E and f W to detect RE and WF which are the write signal of E\(east of its own PE and the almost-full signal of W\(west of the PE in FPGA-B respectively With w E  the sequencer counts the number of remaining data in the E-FIFO for the issued read-operation at present When the sequencer issues a read operation for an empty FIFO or a write operation for an almost-full FIFO the sequencer becomes the stall state immediately Then it sends a local-stall l.stall signal to the global-stall distributer GSD GSD has the inputs of the l.stall signals from all the sequencers For higher frequency the l.stall signal is latched at the output of each sequencer and reaches GSD at the next cycle In GSD OR operation with all the l.stall signals generates a global-stall g.stall signal which is distributed to all the sequencers If necessary we can insert additional latches into the distribution tree of the g.stall signal to prevent an operating frequency from decreasing Here for explanation we assume the distribution tree without latches that we implemented in the prototype system Sequencers in the execution state stall immediately when they receive the g.stall signal Note that the sequencers with delayed stall issue one more MOp than Sequencer 2 because it locally stalls prior to the global stall Therefore Sequencer 2 has to issue the MOp before the other sequencers resume execution C Stall control logic of a sequencer Fig.6 shows the stall control logic of a sequencer The logic generates the l.stall signal with RE and/or WF and then makes the sequencing unit stall when the l.stall signal or the g.stall signal is asserted Fig.6 shows the example of Sequencer 3 with the inputs of w N  w E  f S and f W  The readand write-signals for S N Eand W-FIFOs are sent to PEs as a part of MOPs Write-full is detected by using AND operation with the Write-*-FIFO signal and the f  signal Read-empty detection requires more complex logic a read-empty detector  to count the remaining data in the FIFO OR operation of the RE and WF signals generates the l.stall signal which is output to GSD and used by the stall control unit SCU

route?? The ordinal position on a route is denoted by a sequence number. This enables meaningful data selections The status demanded in requirement 3 is kept in a dedicated field of the fact table. The status can also capture the current state of an item that has not yet reached its destination. By using the status field to exclude arrivals, an aggregated near time monitoring is enabled \(requirement 4 Providing planned data to confirm with requirement 5 could not be realized in the classic way by simply including budget data in the fact table: Each item transfer is conceived to be an actual event defined by a real item and a real track section at an actual period of time. However, the actual route a item takes can very well deviate from the plan. For this reason, the field planned flag is included: The planned data is kept in separate fact fields that can be mirrored with the actual data by a join over the unique item number Requirements 6 and 7 are saliently depicted in the model. Of particular interest are the box, pallet, and container dimensions which store packaging information: Each individual article is an item that can be assigned to such a logistical unit during an item transfer. Simultaneously, the logistical units themselves are treated as items, although they have different global routes This data model does not include any recursions for packaging and routes in order to impose uniform aggregation paths. This leads to the requirement that such structures from operational systems must be recursively taken apart during data extraction. Figure 2 shows the three level hierarchy that has been designed for the prototype regarding the route  Global Route Section Sub Route Tr ac k S ec tio n H ie ra rc hy   Figure 2. Three level hierarchy  The global route labels the complete actual or planned transfer from the initial origin to the ultimate destination, while the sub route denotes a part of that route. This middle layer is included to be able to group subsequent track sections based on organizational responsibility. The section is the smallest unit the path between two RFID readers. For large scale implementations, the hierarchy might be further divided up. This should especially be necessary when a multitude of small-scale transport events enters the data set Eventually, quite a few attributes on the dimensions are basically potential cost \(or time Their combination should be reflected in the facts 6. Prototype and demonstration scenarios  


 The case studies introduced in chapter 4 were the starting point for the development of a prototype that is essentially built on top of the discussed data model The prototype is implemented in MS SQL Server 2005 \(representing the DWH Cognos 8 \(for the analyses type is generated with a data generator that has been realized in Java. During the data generation process systematical deviations can be injected into the data set \(e.g. a tendency to take alternate, expensive routes, shrinkage, or temperature-induced spoilage All relevant parameters regarding the set up and the deviations can be set in a XML definition file The scenarios that will be presented are based on the retail chain case and are built upon the same assumptions. All analyses work with a single integrated play facturer delivers products to a German retailer \(Figure 3 clude transportation by trains, ships, airplanes \(on an alternative route  Beijing Manufacturer Tianjin Check Point Stuttgart Retail Store Shanghai Port Hamburg Port Frankfurt GDC Karlsruhe Check Point Amsterdam Port   Figure 3. Schematic representation of the transportation routes in the data set Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 The current data pool addresses five different products with 10,000 items and covers a time horizon of one year. All planned and actual transfer events for the defined global route were generated. The resulting data volume already exceeds 40 MB. This indicates the amount of data that needs to be analyzed in a real world setting with several ten thousand product variants. The data volume results mainly from the item based tracking and the level of detail that is generated with the track sections. It primarily resides in the fact table In the following presentation, the problem area of transport route selection has been chosen because it surfaced both in the manufacturing and in the retail case. Furthermore, it exemplifies the potential of putting data into its logistical context, monitor current and historic data, drill into the data, and contrast plan and actual values. The problem thereby contains the core requirements discussed in section 4.3  6.1. Monitoring  The data model enables a near time monitoring of item subsets which have not yet reached their target destination. It is especially possible to watch the number of items which have been rejected \(manually or automatically sorted out because of defects or surpassing critical sensor values identified as missing, e.g. with smart shelves tool allows conducting aggregations for defined sets of items \(e.g. selected by product type and for a given 


global route etc      Figure 4. Monitoring shrinkage  Figure 4 shows the total number of rejected and lost items for the actual and planned sub routes on the global route Beijing  Stuttgart  The OLAP-based navigation on top of the derived data model allows for an immediate drill down and slicing of the data to give an overview on the current situation within one selected retail store. Thereby a clearer picture of ?hot spots? can be gained. Figure 6 shows such an analysis. The sequence of tracksections follows the basic store layout from the case study as shown in Figure 5   Store Floor Backroom Inventory Retail Shelf St or ag e Sh el f St or ag e Sh el f C he ck ou t C ou nt er s G oo ds R ec ep tio n To Store Floor   Figure 5. Schematic representation of the retail store  In the shown scenario the rejections agglomerate in goods reception and stocking. It can now further be analyzed if the situation is confined to a subset of the products, supplier, transportation mode etc     Figure 6. Drilling into the retail store 


Figure 6. Drilling into the retail store data subset  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 Figure 7. Deviations from the route \(historic data Based on the discussed data model, the system also allows for a visualization of current bottlenecks congestions, route deviations, and many other relevant events It needs to be emphasized that this type of scenario requires an efficient, near time data capturing mechanism on a level of detail and preciseness which is far from being available with established identification technologies  6.2. Analysis of historic data  The storage and aggregation of historic data is a facilitator for the identification of patterns e.g. regarding spoilage or unstable delivery reliability Among other scenarios, it supports the evaluation of different options regarding transportation routes For the demonstration, an analysis based on contrasting the actual and the plan number of items reveals a systematic deviation from the planned route about 50% of the articles are taking an unplanned transportation route which includes air-transportation The results are also reflected in the associated values for cost and duration Figure 7 depicts a snapshot that shows the number of items on its route and the resulting costs ? for the complete global route and broken down on sub route level. Especially the inclusion of sensor data allows to extend the evaluation to a variety of non monetary measures, e.g. on average transport conditions For well-structured problems the respective data can also be used as a flexile and precise socket for model-based systems that exploit the abundance of relevant optimization algorithms  7. Conclusions and outlook  As shown, the discussed data model incorporates the requirements introduced in section 3. Next to the scenarios presented in this paper, several others have already been filled with demonstration data. Although concrete dimensions and performance indicators vary, the basic model fits both the manufacturing and the vehicle case By aiming at integration and by including aggregation hierarchies and anchors for a variety of slicing options, the model is conceived to be adaptable to all sorts of applications that aim at the monitoring and he analysis of complex good flows with a multitude of individual steps and a lack transparency due to complexity, volume, and geographical as well as organizational distribution. The approach is especially Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 suited for automated data collection scenarios which deliver large amounts of precise data in near time This again highlights the role of the RFID technology and standards like those defined by EPCglobal, which are also seen as facilitators for the data integration across enterprise borders  The role OLAP plays in this research is twofold On the one hand, OLAP represents an established and powerful analytical approach by itself. On the other hand, during the iterative design of the model and the prototype it has proven to be a viable option to vi 


prototype it has proven to be a viable option to visually gather insights into the potential of an integrated, multidimensional data collection This data collection is seen as a core building block of a DWH with RFID data for applications in logistics. The DWH approach allows to embed analytical RFID-applications into centralized and specialized BI units and thereby to align them with the general trend in the decision support domain towards increased professionalization. However, from the data model it can already be seen that the refinement steps for the raw RFID measurements feeding the DWH are by no means trivial  They include 1. Assigning RFID measurement events to units of analysis ? in the model: the track section This also entails the necessity for a purposeful grouping of RFID readers 2. Deciding on what measurements are needed for which analysis at what time ? with consequences regarding the transfer medium \(satellite, cell phone network, or fixed line middleware infrastructure 3. Aligning the track sections with the planned route 4. Binding together events measured with RFID and data captured by other means, e.g. when sorting out defective products 5. Harmonizing the measurement values syntactically and semantically for all involved organizations 6. Harmonizing the dimensional data to get meaningful results 7. Building up the aggregation hierarchies which include packaging and routing hierarchies. It needs to be considered that the actual and planned routes can deviate and the routes and the aggregation hierarchies for the track section need to be \(re after each data load  Upcoming research activities need to address this ETL-process and provide for suitable ETL tool designs. Besides, the prototype, the data generator, and the resulting data set are subject to continuous expansion and refinement Parallel to this, further research activities aim at a quantitative exploration of the demand among different types of firms as well as at an extensive interview-based validation for both the prototype and based on that, the scenarios it embodies During this process, the prototype not only serves as a model for a potential analysis system. It also becomes a communication and research tool that visualizes conceived RFID scenarios and makes them falsifiable  8.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
