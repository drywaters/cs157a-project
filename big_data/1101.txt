Data Mining Pre-fetching, Cache 1 Introduction With the rapid development of Internet WWW is popular for its multimedia transmission and friendly interactivity Although the speed of network has been improved considerably in recent years the rapid expansion of using the Internet the inherited character of delay in the network and the RequesttResponse working mode of WWW 13 still make the internet traffic very slow and give no guarantee on the Quality 
of Service QoS Because HTTP has no states the web server cannot know the users\222 demand and the users\222 requests cannot be predicted Taking advantage of a cache mechanism and the time locality of WWW access the browser can preserve the documents ever accessed in the local machine By this means for the documents in the local cache the browser does not need to send the requests to the remote server or to receive the whole response from 
the remote one. Pre-fetching uses the space Hongji Yang Chih-Hung Chang Department of Department of Computer Science, De Information Science Montjiort University Feng-Chia University Leicestel; England Taiwan locality of access First the users\222 access requests are predicted according to the users\222 current request Second the expected pages are fetched into the local cache when the user is browsing the current page 6 Finally, the users can access these pages downloaded from the local cache 
And thus this can reduce the access delay to some degrees. Pre-fetching is one kind of active caches that can cache the pages which are still not requested by the user The application of pre-fetching technology in the web can greatly reduce the waiting time after users have sent their requests Pre-fetching technology is based on prediction algorithms Data mining is a technique, with which a lot of unknown, implicit but potentially useful information such as knowledge rules 
and regularities for decision-making are mined Based on the historic data and the current data accessed by the user users activities in the future are predicted through data mining and relevant web pages are pre-fetched The data in the users\222 local cache can be taken as the data sources of data mining This paper concentrates on the above issues and discusses the application of data mining techniques in the pre-fetching of web pages Firstly a simple WWW 
data model is given Secondly we put forward an interest association repository Thirdly we introduce the web data mining technology Fourthly an algorithm of predicting the users\222 activities is introduced. Finally, we present an agent based web pre-fetching system 2 Simple WWW Data Model T The web pages are defined in HTML language By using MIME a web page can contain different types of 372 0-7695-0933-9/00 10.00 0 2000 IEEE 


elements A hyper media system l is made up of web pages linked by hyper links among each other In order to predict a user\222s activities we need a data model to describe the interest association rules in the web pages Several data models 5,8,9,10,18 have described the WWW In order to meet the demand of data mining and represent the characteristic of the cache this paper proposes a simple WWW data model Some concepts and definitions of this model are presented below Definition 1 Let triple Id P time be a page node where each page node is associated with an Id time the latest time when the page node is accessed and P a collection of properties P  property p Ii 1,2  The property can be the relative URL the type the collection of linking nodes the container the content the updated time and so on According to whether the links exist 12 and the pointing direction of the links in the web pages the page nodes can be classified into isolated page nodes source page nodes and target page nodes A page node which does not contain any links is the isolated page node A page node which contains links is called the source page node of such links While a page node which is pointed by some other links is called the target page node of such links Apparently, according to different links one page node can be a source page node and/or a target page node of such links Definition 2 Let triple Id string target-node-id be a linking node where each Id identifies only one linking node string describes the presenting information of this linking node and target-node-id is the id of the target page node Definition 3 Let triple source-node L target-node be a link, where source-node is the source page node L is the linking node and target-node is the target page node L E collection of links in the source-node L.target-node-id  target-node Figurel Simple WWW Data Model Figurel shows the proposed simple WWW data model In this model, each node represents one web page these nodes are inter-linked by the links that clearly represent the association of these web pages The web browsers now use the cache technology which preserves the latest web pages accessed by the users When the users want to access these web pages again the browser first examines whether these web pages are cached locally If so the browser will then check whether the corresponding web pages are updated If updated these web pages can be achieved from the corresponding web servers Otherwise the pages are fetched from the local cache. That is to say it is a passive mechanism in current browsers The historic data in the cache reflect the users\222 interest in browsing information and the associating information among the users\222 interest is useful to foresee the users\222 activities The associations among the web pages in the cache can be described easily in the simple WWW data model in Figure 1 But unfortunately such a model can not visually represent the associating information of users\222 interests In order to predict users\222 activities and implement the active cache certain measures must be taken to transform the data in the cache from the simple WWW data model to another data model so that they become more suitable for predicting This approach will be introduced in the web data mining section below 3 Building the Interest Association Repository When a user is accessing a web page normally she or he will follow the links in the web page to access other web pages Based on the current web page we can predict the links to be accessed by the user, and then can pre-fetch these web pages which will speed up browsing It is supposed that the browser can pre-fetch all the pages pointed by the links in the current web page It works better when there are only a few links that point to the different web servers. But such method is not advisable The first reason is that it is generally not possible that the user accesses all the links in the web page. Another reason is if the fee is charged by network stream the user may pay much more overhead. Further more, the streams of the Internet system should be balanced So in this paper we sort the links in the web page according to certain policy and pre-fetch a few web pages which are more possible to be accessed. Considering the response time of the system and the difficult level in the realization of the different systems we apply the simple association rules to predict the users\222 activities The interest association repository is made up of some interest association rules The interest set dictionary T is represented as  t  t2  t  where t  t2   t are lemmas Here are more definitions Definition 4 The interest node is defined as a pair Node t   t  weight where t is the lemma in the interest set T and weight is the weight of t  Definition 5 The interest association rule is a triple 373 


Rule\(Node  t,T  t  Node t  weight, Node t  where weight is the probability from the interest node Node t t,T linking to the interest node Node t  t  O weight 21 Definition 6 The interest association repository is a set of interest association rules where RULE  Rule Node  t Node t  I Rule\(Node ts Node t  is a rule is a rule The interest association rules in the interest association repository must satisfy Rule\(Node\(t,T  Node\(t  I P\(Nudr\(t  P\(Node t   where  t It E T Rule\(Node ts Node t  E RULE The interest association rules in the interest association repository point out the probability from one lemma interest to another From the interest association repository the user\222s browsing tracks and the current web page we can predict the most possible accessed links in the current web page The interest association rules in the interest association repository are based on the analysis of the great amount of historic data We now introduce the construction of the interest association repository in details The repository can be constructed every certain time When the user browses a web page quite often she or he only accesses some web pages of her or his current interests Such web pages are more valuable than the historic data Considering the response speed of accessing the web pages we can not reconstruct the interest association repository completely But considering the user\222s browsing tracks we use a certain method that can modify the interest association repository step by step Therefore the fault of the data in pre-fetching period is avoided Users\222 browsing tracks are made up of the users\222 current accessing web pages If all the n previous pages must be processed when the user accesses the n+lth web page the response time cannot be assured when n is big So an incremental algorithm which modifies the interest association repository every time works well when the user accesses one web page Algorithm 1 the increment algorithm of adjusting the interest association repository Assume that the user is accessing the nth web page Y  A few steps are taken as follows to modify the interest association repository Step 1 Calculate the frequency of lemmas of T in the web page Y the slicing stemming and thesaurus technologies  161 are taken and a set K  Y     tf fi  I I_ t E T is obtained where fi is the frequency of t,\222 appearing in Y  f O,iE N Each Node  t  in the interest association repository is adjusted as follows Step 2 if Node  t  t  tf\221 and  tf f  E K Y  then Node t   Node t   f x F\(n where F\(n a monotonous and non-degressive function represents the freshness It is easily proved that the function F\(n ensures that the more recently the web pages are accessed the more favorable is to predict these web pages F\(n can be n nz and so on During this process the weight of the node in the interest association repository increases gradually according to the user\222s accessing sequence so that the sequence of the user\222s accessing tracks has been embodied in the interest association repository We can use the following steps to predict the links that will be chosen by the user 4 The Proposed Data Mining Technique Data mining has been well-known as a database technology developed in recent years  171 It can mine the implicit unknown and potentially useful knowledge and rules for predicting Using these rules we can predict the user\222s impending activities The interest association rules directly represent the relations of reasoning between interests But the data in the cache shown in the simple WWW data model directly represent the link relations in the web pages which cannot directly reflect the association degree between interests Therefore certain measures are taken to transform the data in the cache shown in the simple WWW data model The associations the sequence patterns and the sequence of same time can benefit from the association analysis in the data mining technology In convenience we do not consider the transferable relations among the rules when we build the interest association rules Hence it is suitable to apply the method of discovering relations by the model of the simple interest association rules Because mining information from the abundant historical data may take more time it is not proper to predict the user\222s activities online The solution is to use increment algorithm shown in the above to mine the user\222s browsing interest association rules every certain time based on the historical information in the cache Now we represent the algorithm for mining the association rules Algorithm 2 mining the interest association rules from the data in the cache for each page Yi in the set C do I for1 I for each link I in the set L  Yi  do  for2 assume I target-node  Yj  374

fetched web pages selected by the user to the number of the user\222s visited web pages The availability of the pre fetched web pages is the ratio of the number of the pre fetched web pages to the link number of the links in the user\222s visited web pages The pre-fetching ratio is the ratio of the number of the pre-fetched web pages to the number of the links in the user\222s visited web pages The less pre fetching ratio and the more hit ratio and availability of the pre-fetched web pages the better is the optimization of the system The experimental data shown in the table 1 are closely associated with the web sites selected by the user the user\222s current interest and the user\222s visiting activities The benefit of tracing the user\222s current interest is provided in the agent-based web pre-fetching system which can commendably adapt the user\222s current interest The whole evaluations in this experiment show that the average hit ratio is 50.0 and that the average pre fetching ratio is 23.4 We can conclude that the agent based web pre-fetching system optimizes the course of the user\222s visiting web pages 8 Conclusion This paper first presents a simple WWW data model and then introduces some technologies with which the data in the cache of the browser can be mined the knowledge is saved into the interest association repository and the users\222 impending activities can be predicted Integrated with the data mining technique the agent technology and the web technology better quality of web service for the users is provided The design ideas of the agent based web pre-fetching reflect the development tendency of intelligent web browsers 9 Acknowledgments We would like to thank Zhou Xiaoyu Xu Lei, Huang Hui Liu Yuan Li Shenzhi and other people at Ada lab who met to discuss the related issues and improved the readability References I Berners-Lee Tim .et al Hypertext Markup Language 2.0 Intemet Network Working Group RFCl866 MIT/W3C 1995 Bemstein, M 223An Apprentice That Discovers Hypertext Links\224 European conference on Hypertext Versailles 1990 3 Botafogo R.A Rivlin E and Shneiderman B 223Structural Analysis of Hypertexts Identifying Hierarchies and Useful Metrics\224 ACM Transactions on Information Systems 10\(2 April 1992 pp 142 180 Chen M S et al 223Data Mining for Path Traversal Patterns in A Web Environment\224 Proceedings of the 16\221h 2 4 International Conference of Distributed Computing System 1996 pp 385-392 Chen Ying Xu Hongbin and Wang Nengbin 223Towards Globalization of Distributed Data Sources over WWW  Data Model and Query Language\222\222 Journal of Sofmare Cheung D W et al 223Discovering User Access Patterns on the World Wide Web Knowledge Based Systems\224 Journal Elsevier Science 1998,10\(7 7 De Bra P Houben G J and Kornatzky Y 223An Extensible Data Model for Hyperdocuments\224 4th ACM Conference on Hypertext Milan December 1992 pp 8 Etzioni 0 and Weld D 223Intelligent Agents on the Internet, Fact, Fiction and Forecast\224 IEEE Expert 1995 9 Genesereth M R and Ketch S P 223Software Agents\224 Communication of the ACM 1994, 37\(7 pp 48-53 IO Gudivada V N 223Informaiton Retrieval on the World Wide Web\224 IEEE Internet Computing 1997 1\(5 pp Ill Krulwich B and Burkoy C 223The InfoFinder Agent Learning User Interests through Heuristic Phrase Extraction\224 IEEE Expert 1997 12\(5 I21 Leggett J et al 224Special issues on hypertext\224 Communications of ACM 1994 37\(2 pp. 26-1 08  131 Marko Balabanovic and Yoav Shoham 223Learning Information Retrieval Agents Experiments with Automated Web Browsing\224 Proceedings of the AMI Spring Symposium on Information Gathering from Heterogenous Distributed Resources Stanford CA March 1995 14 Peter W Foltz and Susan T Dumais 223Personalized Information Delivery An Analysis of Information Filtering Methods\224 Communications of the ACM 35\( 12 pp 5 1-60 December 1992  151 Robert Armstrong Dayne Freitag, Thorsten Joachims and Tom Mitchell, \223Web-Watcher A Learning Apprentice for the World Wide Web\224 Proceedings of the AAA1 Spring Symposium on Information Gathering from Heterogenous Distributed Resources Stanford CA March 1995 I61 Stotts P D et al 223Petri-Net-Based Hypertext Document Structure with Browsing Semantics\224 ACM Trans on Information Systems 1989 7\(1 pp 3-29  171 Zhang Weifeng and Xu Baowen, \223Research on Framework Supporting Web Search Engine\224 Journal of Computer Research  Development 2000,37  181 Zhang Weifeng Xu Baowen and Zhou Xiaoyu, \223Counting Techniques in Web Pages\224 Mini-Micro Systems in preparation I91 Zhang Weifeng Xu Baowen and Zhou Xiaoyu 223Web Page Techniques for Interacting between Elements\224 Computer Enginering in preparation 20 Zou Tao et al 223The Technology Implementation of Information Mining on WWW\224 Journal of Computer Research  Development 1999, 36\(8 pp 102 1  1024 5 1998,9\(8 pp 566-573 6 222-23 1 10\(4 pp.44-49 58-68 377 


old as in Section 6.2 and increasing confidence thresholds For example, the WWW database was mined with confi dence thresholds of 0.06 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 and 0.9 using a 0.06 support threshold in all cases The results of the application of this preprocessing tech nique on the association rules outputted by these ten min ing processes of the WWW database are summarized in the upper left hand histogram of Figure 2 Each gray bar indi cates the number of rules mined using a specific confidence threshold For example, the first leftmost gray bar in the WWW histogram depicts the 9,206 association rules that were mined with 0.06 confidence level The black bar su perimposed on it indicates the number of rules deleted as a result of the application of this preprocessing technique on the respective list of rules, 3,793 in this case That is over 41 of the rules mined by from the WWW database us ing 0.06 support and confidence thresholds were deleted by Interestingness Preprocessing technique 1. This deletion is very significant considering that no information of any sort was required to perform it. This Interestingness Preprocess ing technique performed even better on the output of mining the WWW database using increasingly higher confidence levels deleting as much as 65 of the rules mined with 0.9 confidence levels, as indicated by the rightmost bar in the WWW database histogram out of the 1,503 rules mined the rightmost gray bar\977 rules \(the superimposed black bar\rules were deleted The other five histograms in Fig ure 2 summarize the results of applying the first Interesting ness PreProcessing technique to the other five databases The average deletion brought about by the application of the first Interestingness PreProcessing technique are 49.3 f 7.9 for the WWW database, 55.2 f 9.8% for the Mushroom database 69.4 If 18.0 for the Nursery database 57.7 f 7.3% for the Chess database, 72.6 f 8.6 for the Adult database and 3.7 f 1.5 for the Gro cery database These results are extremely encouraging a significant number in most cases an average of over half the rules outputted by the mining algorithm are deleted by the application of this preprocessing technique This is a significant result not only because of the large number of rules that is deleted but also because this deletion requires no information of any kind from a user of the KDD process 6.3.2 The results of the application of the Interestingness PrePro cessing 2 technique \(Section 5.2 to the six databases were more modest than those of the application of the first tech nique Even these modest results are very significant a re duction even of a small percentage of the rules is both ef fective and important when these results are achieved au tomatically without any interaction with any users The average elimination brought about by the second prepro Results Interestingness Preprocessing Tech 2 Figure 3 Results of the application of Inter estingness Preprocessing 2 technique cessing technique was as follows 3.3 f 3.4 for the WWW database 17.4 f 5 for the Mushroom database 2.5 f 2.7 for the Nursery database 3.1 f 1.8 for the Chess database 1 f 1.9% for the Adult database We present the detailed results in a graphical representation in Figure 3 for the first two databases 6.3.3 Results Sequential Application of Interesting ness Preprocessing Techniques As depicted in Figure 1, the Interestingness PreProcessing techniques can and should be applied sequentially We pro ceeded to do so applying the two preprocessing techniques we introduced in this paper sequentially The results of this sequential application are depicted in Figure 4 7 Conclusions and Future Work In this work we defined an Interestingness Preprocessing Step, as part of the interestingness analysis framework, that eliminates association rules that can be determined to be not interesting in a user-, domain-, and task-independent man ner The generic nature of the preprocessing differentiates it from the interestingness processing that do impose a bias on the type of rules outputted as interesting In this work we also introduced the first Interestingness PreProcessing techniques The deletion of un-interesting rules by these techniques is very significant since it is achieved without requiring a user to provide any informa tion Our empirical results indicate that these are powerful techniques in most cases more than half the rules were eliminated by their application It is important to note that any filtering power however weak of any preprocessing technique is significant since all the Preprocessing methods are deployed sequentially immediately following the min ing process on any set of mined rules and these results add up We hope that this work will encourage the development of more preprocessing techniques by the KDD community 495

On the left side of Figure 8 are the mode s from which entrance to the state is allowed.  Note that si nce there is more than one state from which you can enter the ISS Operations State”, the entrance modes called out may not all be in the same state Similarly, the exit modes on the right hand side of the diagram lead to modes in different states The spacecraft states and tran sition activities were then modeled as operational flows in CORE as shown in Figure 9 \(next page\e operational activities and their logical sequence are consistent with the Spacecraft State Transition Diagram shown above in Figure 7.

 10 Figure 9 Spacecraft Operational Flow Functional Models After addressing the operational activities that the OSP system needed to perform, the functional models of the OSP system were developed consistent with the system engineering process discussed above.  The first step was to identify the physical hardware elements of the OSP system as prescribed by NASA.  The physical hardware elements of the OSP system were captured in CORE through component decomposition and represented as the product breakdown structure shown in Figure 10  Figure 10 Product Breakdown Structure of OSP System The OSP system functional models were developed by identifying the system functions based on the mission goals and operations that the system needed to perform.  These functions were then allocated to the prescribed physical hardware elements of the sy stem. As requirements and the system architecture evolved, the system functionality was re-allocated to different physi cal hardware elements.  In addition, the functional models also captured the physical interfaces between the OSP system, both internally and externally Interface Definition The CORE database also modeled and captured the interface complexity th at existed for the OSP system.  In the database a functional interface was represented as a collection of links that existed between physical hardware elements and an operational interface was represented as a collection of need-lines that existed between operational elements.  The links/need-lines were further defined by either  performance indices or constraints Internal and external functi onal interfaces were modeled within the CORE database by looking at different layers of the system physical hierarchy For example the interfaces between the OSP system and external systems were modeled as shown below in Figure 11, which depicts the interfaces that exist between the ISS Mating Adapter and ISS.  Internal functional inte rfaces were also modeled by looking at the interfaces that ex ist within the OSP System's physical product breakdown structure.  For example, Figure 12 shows the internal interfaces that exist w ithin the OSP System between the  ISS Mating Adapter \(ISSMA Spacecraft.

Therefore the OSP system had to meet the mission objectives using only existing technologies.  These existing technologies were introduced into the CORE modeling database as requirement constraints on the OSP system Requirements Management Requirements management was performed within the CORE database to track and perform requirements flowdown as well as tie the requirements together with the operational models, functional models, and technologies Requirements told either how well the system needed to perform, set constraints on the system, or defined the interfaces.  In the CORE database, all requirements appeared as either performance indices or constraints The customer objectives were introduced into the CORE database as originating requirements.  These originating requirements included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, guidelines, and standards.  Originating requi rements were then traced to OSP System Level requirements.  The OSP System Level requirements defined the performance indices and constraints at the system leve l.  These performance indices and constraints were then flowed down and decomposed into lower level performance i ndices and constraints at the segment level, element level, and component level.  This supported the development of the system and segment performance specifications and requirements traceability matrix All of the requirements captured in CORE were directly tied to either the operational model, functional model, or technologies.  If the requirement was a performance requirement, it was tied to either the operational or functional model through a performance index.  The performance index indicated how well the function or operation needed to be accomplished. The function or operation in turn was tied back to the hardware elements of the OSP system.  For example, the requirement for two days of contingency operations by the spacecraft while not mated to ISS was represented as a performance index exhibited by the “Spacecraft On-O rbit Operations” activity previously shown in Figure 9. The “Sp acecraft On-Orbit Operations activity was in turn performed by the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement set a constraint on the system, it was depicted as a constraint on either an operational element or hardware element in CORE.  For example, the requirement that the spacecraft shall have an operational service life of thirty years was captured in CORE as a constraint on the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement defined an interface, it appeared as either a performance index or constraint on a link.  For example, the requirement that the mechani cal interface between the ISS Mating Adapter and Spacecraft shall be the Low Impact Docking System \(LIDS constraint that was placed on 


 12 the “Mating Adapter to Sp acecraft Docking/Attachment Mechanism\(s\k previously identified in Figure 12 One of the challenges for the requirements management process was capturing the manmachine interfaces.  This specific challenge was to develop and implement a methodology that allowed operational requirements to drive the physical hardware design.  In CORE, this was accomplished by allowing performance indices tied to the operational model to decompose into performance indices related to the operational model as well as the functional model 6  C ONCLUSION  A robust systems engineering process is required for a large scale program with many interfaces.  The processes and implementation presented in this paper are ideal when faced with a rapidly changing requirements environment and dynamic interfaces.   Traditional acquisition of systems revolves around a rigid set of design-to requirements.   As recent history has shown, opera tionally based acquisition is on the rise.  This means that requirements are more likely to be in flux further into the program The C4ISR methodology and implementation presented in this paper provide a robust system engineering process for a large scale program with many interfaces.  In particular, the dynamic interfaces and the integration of human interfaces were handled through the development of segment states and modes.  The state transitions were driven by system operations.  This operations based systems engineering is necessary to understand large, complex systems The process was implemented using the CORE systems engineering tool.  A flexible tool such as CORE was required to build the custom schema required for this unique program.  The capability to rigorously define the dynamic interfaces as well as decompose those interfaces was required to capture the dynamics of operationally driven systems.  Functional and physical models responded to these operations. This implementation in CORE allowed for a “Systems of Systems” view to be modeled within the same database as requirements management The demise of the OSP and precursor programs cut short the full implementation of this process.  Given time, states modes, and then operational and functional models would have been built for all segments of the system.  In addition the end to end traceability from operational requirements to component design requirements would have provided a robust platform for system verification While human spaceflight is a unique problem, the issue of systems of systems” integration is present in many fields When this is coupled with human integration, the need for an operations approach is multiplied.  Determining how to operate a system after it is functionally and physically designed results in delays and cost escalation.  An approach that takes into account human interaction and operations at the outset is more likely to re sult in a system that succeeds throughout the program lifecycle 7  R EFERENCES    DoD Archi t ect ure Fram ework W o rki ng Group DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.0” August 30, 2003 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The primary development effort of the C4ISR CORE methodology as implemented on the OSP program was completed by Michael Wood, Orbital Sciences Corporation and Marge Dyer, Vitech Corporation 9  B IOGRAPHY  Staci N.

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
