Ef\336cient Relationship Pattern Mining using Multi-relational Iceberg-cubes Dawit Yimam Seid Sharad Mehrotra Department of Computer Science University of California Irvine 000 dseid,sharad 001 ics.uci.edu Abstract Multi-relational data mining\(MRDM is concerned with data that contains heterogeneous and semantically rich relationships among various entity types In this paper we introduce multi-relational iceberg-cubes MRI-Cubes as a scalable approach to ef\336ciently compute data cubes aggregations over multiple database relations and in particular as mechanisms to compute frequent multi-relational patterns 322itemsets\323 We also present a summary of performance results of our algorithm 1 Introduction Numerous analysis and data mining tasks in a wide va 
riety of applications including intelligence analysis social network analysis business data analysis web data mining and bioinformatics are based as much on the links among heterogeneous entities and events as the properties of individual entities Hence the databases in these applications contain both attribute and semantic relationship data This data is stored in multi-relational multi-table form in relational database systems as a set of linked tables each corresponding to some conceptual entity or relationship Multirelational data mining MRDM is concerned with the discovery of models and patterns from such databases How 
ever applying most MRDM algorithms to realistically large databases is fraught with several challenges including scalability and lack of integration with database systems 6  The two predominant approaches to MRDM are transformation of multi-relational data to a single table and then applying conventional single-table algorithms and direct mining of multi-relational databases A transformation approach that simply converts multiple tables into one joined relation 215universal relation\216 has been shown by a number of studies to suffer from several disadvantages including extreme horizontal and vertical data blow-up 13 l o s s 
of important semantic entity-relationship information carried by the join links 14 and i ncreas ed dat a redundanc y duplication that may introduce statistical skew 7 Propositionalization is a more systematic transformation albeit limited to classi\223cation tasks that reduces the data explosion by summarizing relationship information using aggregation functions However propositionalization also results in exponentially large attribute-value problems especially for non-numeric data sets 13 Moreo v e r  propos itionalization algorithms like Polka 9 a n d RELA GS 1 0  are b ased on inef\223cient data aggregation techniques i.e rely on mul 
tiple SQL group-bys which are known to scale poorly as compared to data cube operators This paper deals with the MRDM task of multi-relational association rule pattern mining that directly operates on multi-relational databases W e propose a scalable algorithm for frequent multi-relational pattern discovery that is ef\223ciently integrated with database systems Multi-relational Patterns A multi-relational association rule\(pattern 5 hencefort h abbre vi at ed as MR P  i s given as 000 000 001 000\001 000 000 001 001\002 001 003\004 001

000 001 that satisfy it while con\336dence is the probability of satisfying a certain subset of the pattern given the whole MRP Two streams of previous work has dealt with the discovery of association rules over multiple relations For 1 The support count is done on tuples in the target table Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22204 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 


prolog databases and datalog queries WARMR e x tends the Apriori algorithm to discover a limited class of MRPs There is also an optimization of WARMR called FARMER 12 Our approach di f f ers from t hes e a l gori t h ms in the following ways 1 It runs directly on relational databases and does not require the speci\223cation of any pattern structure instead we directly use the links i.e foreign key constraints among tables 2 It is based on a much more ef\223cient Iceberg-cube computation algorithms 3 It does not require the key of the target table to appear in all tables as in WARMR The work 11 has cons idered relational as s o ciation rule mining on a star-schema where the target table is the fact table and joins are of length one Unlike this body of work we consider association rules over tables with arbitrary structure and depth of joins 2 Multi-relational Iceberg-cubes We propose a novel approach based on Iceberg-cube computation 3 that s upports the critical component of MRP mining namely frequent 215itemset\216 conjunction discovery Iceberg-cubes are a type of data cube computed over attributes dimensions of a table where each aggregated value  measure  is above a given user speci\223ed threshold also called iceberg condition  When the aggregation function is COUNT Iceberg-cubes are equivalent to frequent conjunctions the threshold being the inimum support lue Iceberg-cube computation algorithms have two attractive features with respect to MRP mining 1 they are based on depth-\223rst traversal of the pattern lattice 2 which is much more ef\223cient than breadth-\223rst approaches employed by past work 2 they can be implemented inside database systems with relative ease Below we present an algorithm called multi-relational Iceberg-cubes MRI-Cubes that extends an Iceberg-cube computation algorithm called BUC Bottom-up computation to compute MRPs The MRI-Cube algorithm 1 ef\223ciently interleaves cubing predicate set enumeration with join path traversal while retaining the scalability of BUC by ensuring that only one partition of a single table is read to memory at a time 2 minimizes the number of tuples involved in the join paths reachable from the target table The Multi-Relational Iceberg-cube Trie Our algorithm utilizes a pre\223x trees trie referred to as multi-relational iceberg-cube trie or simply MRI-Cube trie  to integrate cubing with join path traversal Populated as the cubing algorithm progresses the MRI-Cube trie also stores counts and link structures of MRPs Each node in an MRI-Cube trie 2 for single table association rule mining as well the most ef\223cient techniques like Eclat and FP-growth are based on depth-\223rst approach see for comparison procedure MRI-Cube input,CloneJoinNodes 1  Cubing Phase 2 000

stores all information pertaining to the cuboid resulting from grouping by the attributes in the path from e root to itself In order to terlink group-bys over attributes from multiple tables in the MRI-Cube trie we distinguish between two ypes of attributes data attributes and join attributes Join attributes consist of foreign and primary keys of tables while all the other attributes are considered to be data attributes We make the reasonable assumption that join attributes store relationship information only The MRI-Cube trie consists of two types of nodes namely data nodes and join nodes designated by a boxed node in 223gure 2 that correspond to the two types of attributes Preprocessing In a preprocessing step we determine the join graph 3 rooted at the target table as well as the cubing order of attributes for each table using information in the database schema catalog Like BUC we order the group-by attributes based on decreasing cardinality The exception to this is the requirement that all join attributes be placed at the end of the cubing order The MRI-Cube Algorithm The algorithm is shown 3 Due to limited space we only consider patterns over acyclic join paths in

Pointer Figure 3 An MRI-Cube trie Node in 223gure 4 It iterates between two phases namely cubing phase and expansion phase The inputs are a data partition initially the whole target table and a queue of join nodes which is initially empty on which the partition is to be joined as expansion The Cubing Phase  The cubing phase lines 1-18 of 223gure 4 starts with the target table and recursively performs cubing on each attribute using BUC i.e applying 000\001\002 003\004\005\005 pruning until a join attribute is encountered or no more group-by is possible When a join attribute is reached group-by is performed on it like the other data nodes But the recursion stops and returns towards the root As such join nodes delineate the boundary of the cubing phase Every time the recursion returns to the root all the leaves in the MRI-Cube trie will have either join nodes or a data node with the 223nest granularity The Expansion Phase  The expansion phase is launched when the cubing recursion returns to the root Expansion extends cubing to the next table on the join path The expansion phase involves three steps Step 1 Pick the left-most leaf join node with the leastdepth henceforth referred to as the LM-LD node from the MRI-Cube trie and join the set of keys in this node with the referenced table lines 21-22 of 223gure 4 The in can be done using a hash based or sort e technique Since only foreign keys that meet the 000\001\002 003\004\005\005 condition are kept in the join node no redundant join is performed More importantly since the LM-LD node is the least aggregated node the result of this join is suf\223cient to expand all the nodes in the MRI-Cube trie corresponding to the same join attribute as the LM-LD node see 15 for a formal proof Step 2 Find all other leaf join nodes called 215 clones 216 that correspond to the same attribute as the LM-LD node by traversing the MRI-Cube trie horizontally backward from right-to-left  Lines 23-24 in 223gure 4 perform this traversal and store the clone nodes in a queue called 006 007 b\002\t\n b\001\002\013 b\f\t\003  Step 3 Recursively cube the joined table from step 1 while concurrently expanding the LM-LD node as well as all its clones in the right-to-left order with group-bys computed on the joined table\220s data attributes Speci\223cally all clone join nodes found in the leaves of the MRI-Cube trie are simultaneously grown using only one scan loading of a partition from the new joined table This can be performed by applying intersection e.g hash set intersection of the keys in the join node and e corresponding key in a partition In 223gure 4 the 006 007 b\002\t\n b\001\002\013 b\f\t\003 queue is passed in the recursive call to MRI-Cube line 26 so that subsequent cubing based on each partition of the joined table is applied on all clones Finally once e expansion of the current LMLD node and all its clones is completed i.e the referenced table is cubed on all its data attributes we pick the next LM-LD node and repeat the above process This continues until no more cubing or expansion is possible i.e until all leaf nodes are data nodes with no right-brother In addition to ensuring correctness the right-to-left expansion of clones allows us to prune expansion of join nodes when a partition can not result n cells that meet the 000\001\002 003\004\005 lines 13-14 in 223gure 4 As the clone nodes are traversed from right to left i.e from the least aggregated granule to the 223ner granule we can prune the expansion of clone nodes using the Apriori property This is because if a partition fails to produce qualifying cells when expanding a join node then it will not produce any qualifying cells in all clones on its left see 15 for a formal proof In summary the MRI-Cube algorithm offers i CPU ef\336ciency  a data partition is scanned only once ii Space ef\336ciency  at a time only one partition needs to reside in memory hence if a table does not 223t in memory it can be partitioned until it does iii Two types of pruning performed during the recursive cubing phase  000\001\002 003\004\005\005 pruning and e expansion phase clone expansion pruning Example 1 The cubing and expansion operations described above are illustrated in the MRI-Cube trie shown in 336gure 2 whose construction also mirrors the MRI-Cube algorithm The order in which the recursive cubing phase is executed is shown by the labels r 000  r 001  etc The order in which the join nodes are expanded is shown by the labels t 000  t 001  etc The horizontal line across the trie shows the point where the algorithm entered into the 336rst expansion phase After the 336rst expansion phase labels are shown only for the cubing done on the LM-LD nodes the same processing is done simultaneously for all clones 3 Performance Analysis In this section we validate the performance of the MRICube algorithm We implemented our algorithm using C Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Internati onal Conference on

a target table for MRI-Cube For FARMER we had to convert the dataset to a predicate-based representation and specify the required patterns similar to the schema of the database as well as other required parameters and biases The 223gures show that as both min supp and data size increases MRI-Cube achieves greater performance In fact for data size above 500k FARMER could not stop after an hour see 223gure 6 Synthetic dataset This dataset was generated using the following parameters number of records per table number of attributes average number of distinct values for each attribute and average join cardinality for a pair of tables Zipf distribution was used to generate attribute values Since FARMER requires setting complex parameters and biases which make it dif\223cult to run over complex schemas we do not compare MRI-Cube with it on the synthetic data Instead we compare MRI-Cube with a naive approach called 215Join-then-mine\216 that 223rst performs s and then applies single table cubing The joined tables are found by a series of outer joins starting from the target table Although the resulting cubes do not possess the useful structure found in MRI-Cube patterns we believe this approach\220s performance as compared to MRI-Cube shades light on the effect of MRI-Cube\220s ability to avoid redundant joins Figure 7 and 8 show that while the run e of Join-thenmine explodes fast with increase in number of tables and average number of attributes per table MRI-Cube achieves a much slower rate of increase Figure 9 compares run time as the maximum join path length increases Again MRICube showed lower rate of rum-time increase Finally 223gure 10 shows performance against increase in min supp In this case the rate of run time growth for Join-then-mine was close to that of MRI-Cube This may be due to the common pruning technique i.e Iceberg cubing used by both Acknowledgments This research is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No

2004 IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid An additively homomorphic public-key cryptosystem can be used to implement oblivious counters by which one can add two ciphers without knowing their plain By us ing A iteratively one can easily calculate E m  z from E z for some m E A In the interest of clarity we mark E z E y for A E z E Y E 2 lEJy for A E z E y miE z for E m  z and CE z There are several cryptosystems which are both prob abilistic and additively homomorphic In such cryptosys tems the rerandomization operator can he implemented for example by E z  E z E 0 For implementing the oblivious counters, the algorithm proposed in this paper uses the popular Paillier cryptosystem I I  an additively homomorphic probabilistic cryptosystem over Z How ever, any other such cryptosystem can be uscd Finally we note that in order to support the encryption of ncgative inte gers standard shifting techniques can he applied forAf  A+\(A+\(E\(zi E\(z z 5 K-Private Distributed Association Rule Mining We now describe Private-Majority-Rule a k-private dis tributed association rule mining algorithm The master plan of Private-Majority-Rule is similar to that of Majoriry-Rule the resources perform majority votes over candidate rules to decide whether they are frequent and confident How ever in Private-Majority-Rule all of the counters are en crypted into oblivious counters that cannot be decrypted by the resources This ensures that a resource can never dis cover the data of its neighbors The only ones which can decrypt the counters are managers however a manager will never be given the oblivious counter directly Instead, when ever a resource has to decide whether to send a message to its neighbor it performs a secure protocol with a manager by the end of which the resource learns whether the mes sage should be sent and the manager learns nothing Also whenever new candidates should be generated, the resource performs a similar protocol with a manager by the end of which the resource learns the new candidate set and noth ing more and the manager learns nothing The private majority voting procedure we use is simi lar to the one described in 6 with one important differ ence In 6 the resource is not allowed to lean the ma jority However in privacy-preserving association rule min ing many majority votes are performed  one for each can didate  and those votes are dependent in the sense that a vote taking place for 0  U b signifies that the major ity for both 0  a and 0  b is one What this means is that, unlike the model discussed in 6 our majority vot ing algorithm must remain privacy-preserving even though a resource does learn the majority 5.1 Private-Majority-Rule Algorithm Consider a system composed of resources running Majority-Rule with all votes and consequently all mes sages encrypted in oblivious counters. Instead of maintain ing sumuv cmnluv sumvu countuu A and Auu it will maintain sum count sum count A and A  their encrypted versions mnt counts trans actions But in order to maintain k-resources privacy we also need to count resources For this purpose we add the counter num When the resource needs to send a neigh bor a message that sums the evidence provided by the rest of its neighbors it will use the c algorithm to sum the oblivi ous counters Problems arise only when it needs to evaluate the counters when it needs to decide whether a mes sage should be scnt or what the majority is In both these cases it must consult with a manager. Ncvenheless it is es sential that the manager not learn the contents of the oblivi ous counters Our first step thus is describing a secure primitive  PrivateEvalCond Algorithm I  by which a resource can use a manager to evaluate a condition without disclosing to the manager the contents of the respective oblivious coun ters The primitive's input is a tuple of encrypted values  xpr and a condition which should he evaluated on them The algorithm proceeds in three main steps First, the tuple is hidden among M similar ones Then the group of tuples is sent to a manager which decrypts them all and returns a vector containing the results of evaluating the condition on each tuple Finally the resource will choose the true result from amongst the returned values A re source will use this primitive on two occasions The first is when its input has changed and it has to decide whether to update a neighbor The condition in this case is that for the candidate rule considered either the Majoriry-Rule condition evaluates true or C,EN,Ycount  k mean ing the resource does not retain k-transactions privacy or CvEN,.numUU  k meaning the resource does not retain k-resources privacy The second occasion is when the re source needs to how whether the rule is correct; here, the condition is that Sign Au 2 0 and C,,N~counl 2 k and vEN,-numUV 2 k Using this secure primitive Private-Majoriry-Rule con tinues as follows Where a resource u in Majoriry-Rule would evaluate the condition on A and Auu to decide whether a message should be sent to a neighbor w in Private-Majoriry-Rule u will initiate the PrivareEvalCund primitive and send the message if the result is true When u needs to generate new candidates it will again initiate the PrivateEvalCond primitive in order to discover for each candidate whose oblivious counters have changed whether the rule is correct It will then generate new candidates according to the criteria defined in the Majority-Rule al 41 5

This is because the chances of guessing where the true inputs are hidden are lower than h Moreover, consecutive calls are independent and thus can not assist in boosting this proba bility The third somewhat more involved observation is that when U'S vote changes it is impossible to guess the change unless it affects the majority in a group of either transac tions or resources of size k Assume for example that U'S vote does change the majority in such a group In this case a random guesser that is given the majority before the change the majority after the change, and the information that there has been a change would do,just as well in guessing the ac tual change Now assume that the change in U'S vote does not affect the majority and suppose first that the major ity is of ones We claim that the resulting pattern of mes sages is independent of the data and thus nothing can be learned by looking at such patterns This is true because in Private-Scalable-Majority sum is first decreased below the new value and then increased to the new value see Al gorithm 2 Thus the change will first decrease A and then increase it If messages are sent they will be in response to Algorithm 2 Private-Scalable-Majority  Algorithm for a resource Input sum count A Private dynamic sum and count registers and the rational majority ratio X  X,/Xd Local variables The set of colliding edges E the privacy parameter k and the managers common public key Definitions NF  I U v E V  uw E E  E\(sum  E\(ccmnt numi2c  E\(I X,pi sum~&+sum Ani mnt::',U,+count:;c Outpuf Return the output of PrivateEvalCond3 with my where Cond ZI,XZ.Z  zl 2 k A zZ 2 k A z3 2 01 using C,E,VPcount C.tNrnum A as the inputs xl x2 x3 respectively Updule\(o sum t CwPUEN;1sum;2c count t Send sum;Zc count;;c num:zc to U MajorityCond\(u Return the output of PrivateEvalCond4 with my where Cond\(z1,xZ,z3,z4  ZI k V Xz<k v 23<0AZ4<0 v 23>0/\\Z4>0 using CWEN~coimtZ Cw,Nrnum::c A A;:clA;n as the inputs zl XZ z3 zq respectively On initialization for each uu E E or on failure or re covery of a neighbor v Set sum sum count count;:L num and On receiving sum count num from U Set sum t sum count t count numE t num On change in sum from s to sf Set sum to min\(s s  1 and call Onchange then set sum to maz\(s,s  1 and call Onchange finally set sum to s and call Onchange On a change in one of the local counters  OnChange For each neighbor U if MajorityCond\(v call Updafe\(v the decrease An increase in Au does not trigger messages if A is already positive The same argument holds when there is a majority of zeroes Hence, the pattern of mes sages is indeed independent of the data and nothing can be learnt from it A  ZvtNP Xdtsum:~',u,-X,icount    Cwj&E N cozLnt22cU,U num;;l,u Cw+vE N;'num to E 0 6 Experimental Results To evaluate the performance of Private-Majority-Rule we implemented a simulator capable of running thou sands of simulated resources The network topol ogy was generated using the BRIE topology gen erator ht tp   www c s bu  edu/bri t e Syn thetic databases were produced using the stan 41 6

Anyway, forward the message to the appro priate local Private-Scalable-Majon\222ty instance dard generation tool from IBM Quest group http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest Three databases were generated T512 T1014 and T2016 where the number after the T denotes the average transac tion length and the number after the I stands for the av erage pattern length Each database contains a million transactions Using standard pair-wise independent hash ing techniques, transactions are sampled from the database to simulate the local database of each resource Ex cept in Figure 2b the privacy argument k always equals 10 At the beginning of the simulation each resource samples 10,000 transactions which it processes in batches of about 150 After processing each batch it decides what messages should be sent and on every fifth batch it also communi cates with its manager to create new candidate rules We simulate dynamic databases by incrementing every resource with ten additional transactions at each batch We simulate dynamic composition changes by using 50 resources at the outset and adding an average of five at each hatch stop ping at about 2,500 resources. Transactions continue to he added and messages exchanged until the systems reach a near-stasis the computation never really terminates because transactions continue to be added Throughout this process we measure the recall and precision compared to the precal culated result, of the result at each resource In addition we count the number and type of messages that are exchanged The main results are presented in Figure I Figure la de scribes the recall of the algorithm In all three databases by the time each resource scans its pan of the database for the second time the recall has already reached 90 This is in comparison to just one scan in the Majority-Rule algo rithm 14 In the Private-Majority-Rule algorithm, a rule cannot be found correct before the algorithm gathers infor mation from k resources Thus candidate generation occurs more slowly and hence the delay in the convergence of the recall Figure Ib describes the precision of the algorithm The average precision also climbs above 90 in about two database scans An interesting phenomenon is the decline in precision for the T20.16 database toward the end of the first scan A deeper look reveals that the choice of MinFreq and MinConf led to the creation around that time of a very large number of candidate rules Sheer numbers dic tate that only a few of these candidates would he false pos itives. However since the number of correct rules is only ahout a hundred these false positives led to a noticeable de cline in precision Note however that the false positives were quickly identified and did not significantly impair the convergence rate of the precision for this database Figure IC describes the communication pattern of the algorithm broken down according to the context of the message resource-to-resource communication for the pur pose of an update resource-to-manager communication for the purpose of deciding whether to send a message and resource-to-manager communication for the purpose of de ciding whether a rule is correct and generating new candi dates accordingly At the beginning many candidates are generated. Because the resource has not yet gathered infor mation from k resources the manager will give a positive answer every time it is asked whether an update should be sent This explains the large quantity of update messages in the first database scan Another notable pattern is an increase in the amount of manager consultation messages However as time passes 41 7

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
