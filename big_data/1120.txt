of a single moving platform the estimation problem is hi&ly nonlinear and in certain conditions the range is not even 223observable\224 4,5 Now using several sites to locate targets seems to be a highly adopted approach[6,7 In the absence of noise interference and missed detections bearing lines from two passive sensors wiU intersect to determine a unique location sparse scenario is assumed However in dense environments there may be multiple targets in a given plane and the bearing lines 
of passive sensors will triangulate and create a number of false intersection points In order to diminate these false intersection points correctly and quickly two-level bearing measurement association algorithm is proposed in this paper This method firstly uses a rule to eliminate some false intersection points so the computation burden is decreased Then the maximum Ilkelhood algorithm 8 is used to associate the bearing measurements which can ensure the true association rate is high Simulation is also made and the resuits reveal the feasibilay and 
validity of the bearing measurements association algorithm presented in hi paper and multiple targets can be located and tracked at the same time by passive sensors 2 Bearing Measurements Association Let Z,\(k  Z,\(k  a Z,\(k denote the bearing measurement sets measured by M passive sensors at time k where Z,\(k 8,,,8,,,...,8 1 s1,2 M and N denotes the number of the targets measured by the s passive sensor

Concurrent support counting and the placement of variable sized candidates KISP might have only very few new-candidates at a very low minsup value since the information gathered from each mining all contribute to the candidate reduction In each pass, the number of candidates inserted into the hash-tree is far less than that of GSP Thus KISP is enabled to accommodate more candidates in the same hash-tree during the same pass of database scanning Consequently, we may release the restriction of counting only candidate k sequences to count variable sized candidates concurrently in pass k and reduce the total number of database passes  KISP assumes nothing about the main memory size so that the available memory might be insufficient for generating new candidate k sequences. Analogous to GSP  if the set of frequent k-1 sequences cannot fit into the memory, we apply the relational merge-join technique without pruning [14 to g e n e r a te X k and then output X k to disk after counting  On the contrary, the set of X k is possibly small and occupies only a small part of the memory. We maximize memory utilization by continuously generating the candidates of longer size into the hash-tree until the memory space is nearly full KISP can estimate the space required for X k with S k-1  KB.base  d N k-1  minsup   described in the following Considering the number of candidates generated in each pass X 2 has more candidates than any other X k because none in the candidate superset of size two can be pruned For candidates of X k where k 2, some frequent  k-1 sequences are not to be joined if their subsequences do not match. Assume the number of patterns in S 1  KB.base   p and the number of patterns in N 1  minsup  is q The number of new-candidates in pass 2 is 3 p  q  2  p  q  3 p 2 p  pq 3 q 2 q This formula can be applied to estimate roughly the maximum number of candidates in other passes. Whenever there is room for the next set of candidates in a batch KISP continuously generates and inserts them into the same hash-tree  The hash-tree in GSP is designed to store the same sized candidates in the leaves originally. Accommodating variable sized candidates in the same hash-tree might produce the problem of having no item for hashing. For example, inserting a candidate 4 sequence might cause the re-distribution of an overflowed node, while the re-distribution might need to hash on the fourth item of a candidate 3 sequence in the node. We modify the hashing procedure to put the same prefixed candidates, despite their sizes, in the same leaf. In case there is no item for hashing any more, the candidate is stored in one of the descendent leaves \(due to splitting the overflowed leaf We select the leaf having the fewest number of candidates stored to maximize memory utilization. Since candidates of different size are stored in the same hash-tree, we can check the variable sized candidates against a data sequence at the same time. Therefore, the concurrent support counting minimize the number of database scanning required in KISP  Note that a similar technique named pass bundling is described for association mining in o w e v e r  pass bundling statically sets a limit to determine whether the generation should be continued or not, while KISP  dynamically estimates and computes the available memory for maximum utilization  4.4. Manipulation of the knowledge base The knowledge base should provide fast access to the supports of patterns, support quick estimation of candidate storage required, and be able to expand incrementally Figure 2 displays the logical structure of the knowledge base  A knowledge base is composed of a minimal KB.base and one or more KB heads The minimal KB.base is the smallest KB.base among all the KB.bases in the KB heads. We create a KB head to store the newly acquired information only when the \221new pattern\222 mining part of KISP is executed. A KB head comprises \(1\a KB.base indicating the counting base while adding this head \(2\e number of pattern-support heads ps_heads indicating the total number of pattern-support heads in this KB head \(3\e pattern-support heads  summarizing the pattern-support tables, and \(4\he position of next KB head linking the next KB head so that the knowledge base can \221grow\222 incrementally We group all the same sized patterns in the pattern-support tables so that the pattern information of desired size can be directly found through the position of pattern-support in the corresponding ps_head. The summary information the size of the pattern the total number of counted candidates and the total number of non-zero patterns ps_head is used to estimate the number of new-candidates. The pattern-support table is a list of \(support, pattern\pairs. Note that we keep only the Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


 patterns with non-zero support value to minimize the total size of each pattern-support table. The supports of patterns of the same size\tored in support-descending order in the structure to ease the searching of valid patterns on answering an online query. An option to eliminate support sorting is writing the supports in the order of hash-tree traversal. Even when the pattern supports are directly stored without sorting, searching within the knowledge base is still more efficient than re-mining 5. Experimental results Several experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the KISP algorithm, using an 866 MHz Pentium-III PC with 256MB memory running the Windows NT. Like most studies on sequential pattern mining [2, 4, 12, 14, 16 w e g e n e rat e d t h e sy nt h e t i c  datasets for these experiments using the procedure described in Du e to s p ace li m it w e on l y report th e  results on dataset C 20 T 2.5 S 4 I 1.25 having 100,000 sequences 025\006  N 10000 N S 2500, and N I 25000 026\006 We refer readers to [2 o r th e d etails o f th e p ara m eters  5.1. Comparisons of KISP and GSP  The effect of using knowledge base without concurrent counting optimization is studied first. The interactive discovery comprises five consecutive queries, with minsup  values starting from 2.5% down to 0.5 Figure 3 compares the relative performance of KISP  and GSP The total execution time is 435 minutes by KISP  and 799 minutes by GSP  KISP runs faster than GSP for individual mining except for the very first mining. Figure 3 also depicts the ratios of the number of candidates in GSP to those in KISP Take minsup 0.75% for example the execution time ratio of GSP to KISP is 2.1 times. The time saved by KISP resulted from the reduced number of candidates\227 GSP counted 2.3 times the number of candidates. To illustrate the accumulating power of KB  the number of candidates generated by GSP and by KISP  in each pass is enumerated in Table 1 KISP exhibits excellent mining capability for query intensive applications. As we increased the number of queries from 3 to 11, the average execution time \(also the time required for posterior queries\ed from 1763 seconds to 514 seconds In the experiments with concurrent optimization, the number of database scanning reduced by concurrent support counting is 6, and the reduced execution time is 94 seconds for the mining with minsup 0.5%. Most scans were combined in pass three so that the total number of passes and the total execution times were reduced When users need to find the appropriate set of patterns by reducing the number of patterns found in a query, the next specified minsup would be greater than the counting base of KB  KB  base e next experiment, all KB  base s of the KB s were 0.5%, and 100 minsup s ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% were randomly selected. The mining results are all available in very short time with average execution time 4.3 seconds and maximum execution time 22 seconds. For most queries, the execution time of KISP  is several orders of magnitude faster than GSP which always re-mines from scratch. However, one drawback of KISP is that the size of KB in proportion to the number of candidates stored, might be larger than the size of the original database. For example, the size ratio of KB to DB  is 4.9 for minsup 0.5 5.2. Scale-up experiments In the scale-up experiments, the total number of customers was increased from 100K to 1000K, r unning the same series of minsup 2.5% down to 0.5%\ince KISP  retrieves merely S k-1  KB.base  i.e. f r equ e n t   k-1 sequences in KB for generating candidate k sequences, even without large memory KISP may efficiently discover patterns in large databases with KB  Figure 4 shows that the execution time of KISP increases linearly as the database size increases. The execution times are normalized with respect to the time for 100 000 customers 6. Conclusions The knowledge discovering process is iterative and requires many times of mining since no one can predict the best parameters for the desired outcome. Even a change in minimum support value would demand current approaches to execute the time-consuming process again, not to mention the various query operations such as mining constrained patterns [1 pa t t e rn s  w i t h  h i erarchy 14  In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient mining algorithm for interactive discovery of sequential patterns about varying support thresholds. The proposed KISP  algorithm constructs a knowledge base KB in-disk to minimize the response time for iterative mining. No mining is required if the query result is a subset of KB  otherwise, we speed up individual mining through accessing only frequent sequences in KB for direct new-candidate generation. The proposed approach directly generates only the new candidates not being considered before, concurrently counts variable sized candidates in the same database scanning, and incrementally expands the knowledge base. Only the non-zero patterns grouping by size are kept to minimize the size of KB while providing fast access to pattern information. The performed experiments show that KISP enhances GSP by several orders of magnitude for interactive sequence mining, with good linear scalability  However, the disk space could be a problem without Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE

Experimental Results We investigated our approach against 19 different datasets from [20] as well as a different datasets for forecasting the behaviour of an optimisation heuristic within a hyperheuristic framework [5, 16]. Stratified tenfold cross-validation was used to derive the classifiers and error rates in the experiments. Cross-validation is a standard evaluation measure for calculating error rate on data in machine learning. Three popular classification techniques a decision tree rule \(PART CBA have been compared to MMAC in terms of classification accuracy, in order to evaluate the predictive power of the proposed method The choice of such learning methods is based on the different strategies they use to generate the rules. Since the chosen techniques are only suitable for traditional classification problems where there is only one class assigned to each training instance, we therefore used classification accuracy derived by only the top-label evaluation measure for fair comparison All experiments were conducted on a Pentium IV 1.6 GH PC.  The experiments of PART and RIPPER were conducted using the Weka software system [20]. Weka stands for Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. It is an open java source code for the machine teaching community that includes implementations of different methods for several different data mining tasks such as classification, clustering, association rule and regression. CBA experiments were conducted using a VC++ implementation version provided by [19]. Finally MMAC was implemented using Java We have evaluated 19 selected datasets from Weka data collection [20], in which, a few of them \(6 reduced by ignoring their integer and/or real attributes Several tests using ten-fold cross-validation have been performed to ensure that the removal of any real/integer attributes from some of the datasets does not significantly affect the classification accuracy. To do so we only considered datasets where the error rate was not more than 6% worse than the error rate obtained on the same dataset before the removal of any real/integer attributes.  Thus, the ignored attributes do not impact on the error rate too significantly Many studies have shown that the support threshold plays a major role in the overall classification accuracy of the set of rules produced by existing associative classification techniques [9, 12]. Moreover, the support value has a larger impact on the number of rules produced in the classifier and the processing time and storage needed during the algorithm rules discovery and generation. From our experiments, we noticed that the support rates that ranged between 2% to 5% usually achieve the best balance between accuracy rates and the size of the resulted classifiers. Moreover, the classifiers derived when the support was set to 2% and 3 achieved high accuracy, and most often better than that of decision trees rule \(PART the MinSupp was set to 3% in the experiments. The confidence threshold, on the other hand, is less complex and does not have a large effect on the behaviour of any associative classification method as support value, and thus it has been set to 30

Our algorithm outperforms the rule learning methods in terms of accuracy rate, and the won-loss-tied records of MMAC against PART, RIPPER and CBA 13-6-0, 15-4-0 and 154-0, respectively The evaluation measures of MMAC have been compared on 9 solution runs produced by the Peckish hyperheuristic [5] with regard to accuracy, and number of rules produced. Figures 3a and 3b represent the relative prediction accuracy that indicates the difference of the classification accuracy of MMAC evaluation measures with respect to those derived by CBA and PART, respectively. In other words, how much better or worse MMAC measures perform with respect to CBA and PART learning methods. The relative prediction accuracy numbers shown in Figures 3a and 3b are conducted using the formula PART PARTMMAC Accuracy AccuracyAccuracy  and CBA CBAMMAC Accuracy AccuracyAccuracy  respectively. After analysing the charts, we found out that there is consistency between the top-label and label-weight measures, since both of them consider only one class in the prediction. The top-label takes into account the topranked class, and the label-weight considers only the weight for the predicted class that matches the test case Thus, both of these evaluation measures are applicable to traditional single-class classification problems. On the other hand, the any-label measure considers any class in the set of the predicted classes as a hit whenever it matches the predicted class regardless of its weight or rank. Is should be noted that, the relative accuracy of MMAC evaluation methods against dataset number 8 in Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART 


Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART achieved a higher classification rate against this particular dataset A comparison of the knowledge representation produced by our method, PART and CBA has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the set of rules derived. Figure 4 represents the classifiers generated form the hyperheuristic datasets. Analysis of the rules sets indicated that MMAC derives a few more rules than PART and CBA for the majority of the datasets. In particular, the proposed method produced more rules than PART and CBA on 8 and 7 datasets, respectively. A possible reason for extracting more rules is based on the recursive learning phase that MMAC employs to discover more hidden information that most of the associative classification techniques discard, since they only extract the highest confidence rule for each frequent item that survives MinConf Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 6. Conclusions A new approach for multi-class, and multi-label classification has been proposed that has many distinguishing features over traditional and associative classification methods in that it \(1 that contain rules with multiple labels, \(2 evaluation measures for evaluating accuracy rate, \(3 employs a new method of discovering the rules that require only one scan over the training data, \(4 introduces a ranking technique which prunes redundant rules, and ensures only high effective ones are used for classification, and \(5 discovery and rules generation in one phase to conserve less storage and runtime. Performance studies on 19 datasets from Weka data collection and 9 hyperheuristic scheduling runs indicated that our proposed approach is effective, consistent and has a higher classification rate than the-state-of-the-art decision tree rule \(PART and RIPPER algorithms. In further work, we anticipate extending the method to treat continuous data and creating a hyperheuristic approach to learn  on the fly   which low-level heuristic method is the most effective References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
