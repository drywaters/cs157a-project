 Abstract 227There is already a modest body of research on structural properties of online social networking websites However, there seems to be a big gap when it comes to important questions related to underlying network forces that create that structure. Drawing from empirically grounded theories of off-line communication networks, hypotheses about the biases forces\eating the friendship structure in educational online social networking websites are set up, for dyadic and triadic levels of analysis. Hypothesized micro forces are then empirically investigated by building probabilistic models from the data of an online educational social network, using recent re 
formulations of a biased net modeling approach. In addition magnitudes of forces are investigated longitudinally, based on five observations of a network. Results indicate the existence of all the hypothesized micro structural forces. Reciprocity is by far the strongest force acting in the network, followed by transitivity, similarity and lastly, closure. Reciprocity is shown to increase with the time, whereas transitivity and similarity decrease. Closure bias first decreases, and then steadily increases  Index Terms 227Online Social Networks, Social Networking Websites, Network Structure, Social Network Analysis, Data Mining 
I  I NTRODUCTION  Popularization of online social networking websites such as MySpace and Facebook revolutionized the way people connect and interact with each other. The structural properties of these online social networks \(OSNs\ have recently received attention from research community. However online social networking websites are a fairly new phenomenon and their network structures are not yet studied extensively and sometimes also not carefully. Almost all of the existing studies that examined friendship networks considered macro level structural properties of OSNs. The small number of the studies that involved analysis of the micro 
level structural properties of OSNs are of a limited value, since the micro-level structural processes were either not modeled from the micro-level point of view or their models were to simplistic. The goal of this paper is to start filling this gap, by examining what micro-level structural forces create friendship structure in online social networking websites. On the basis of empirically grounded theories of off-line communication networks, hypotheses are set up about the local forces that, for dyadic and triadic levels of analysis, create the friendship structure in OSNs. Although meaningful theoretical insigh ts can be obtained from expressing theories mathematically, these are not sufficient in themselves to argue for the acceptance of theory. As Hol 
land and Leinhardt note in [12 223 it rem a i n s f o r em p i rical  investigation of these theories in order to help us distinguish formal theory from formal nonsense.\224 In this paper micro structural forces are probabilistically modeled by using recent advances in biased net theory. Datasets from Fitcolab, an educational online social networking website for the students of School of Information Technology in Bosnia, were used for empirical analysis and testing of the proposed hypotheses II  R ELATED WORK  Various descriptive methods from the fields of graph analysis and social network analysis were used for the exploration of macro structural properties of online friendship

since the micro-level structural processes were not modeled from the micro-level point of view Trying to close the micro-macro ga opos ed a  very simple micro-process model intended to explain degree distribution, degree correlation and clustering coefficients. The model includes two processes of how people make online friendship links: process based on connecting nearest neighbour \(representing triangulation\ and a random linkage process. The main drawback of this approach is that it didn\222t account for direction of the friendship links, and thus it is neither capable of evaluating reciprocity nor it can differentiate between different kinds of triangular effects III  P ROBLEM OF COMPETING MICRO FORCES 
 The general problem of the existing research on the analysis of the micro forces acting in online social networking websites is that the micro forces are not properly modeled. By merely observing specific macro structural patterns it is not possible to disentangle which force\(s\ener Haris MEMIC   School of Information Technology, Dzemal Bijedic University, Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina e-mail: memic@ieee.org Structural Micro Forces in Online Social Networking Websites Impact on Friendship Structure 2009 Third IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Techn\ologies \(IEEE DEST 2009 605 
 


ated them. This is because different types of forces can lead to the same structural patterns. Triangular structure between three users, as displayed in Fig. 1, for example, can arise because of either transitivity or random chance of connection, or some other micro structural force It is not possible to evaluate exact level of, say transitivity, without a proper mathematical model that incorporates other micro forces in the model and let the forces control for \(compete against\ other in the model IV  T HEORY AND HYPOTHESES  When dealing with relations in online social networking websites we are dealing with graphs whose actors are social beings and whose friendship and communication choices are social in their nature. Thus, it was decided to draw hypothesis about the dyadic and triadic micro structural forces in social networking websites, from the general communication and social theories that were previously empirically tested in off-line settings Theories of network excha d s o cial ex c h a n g e  2 s u g g e s t th a t  if th e r e l a ti o n is o n e o f th e p o s it i v e s e n t iment, people will create network ties by exchanging information or material resources. According to these theories social networks with above average reciprocity levels are more likely to occur. Reciprocity is a tendency for a tie from i to j to occur more frequently than by chance, if there exist a tie from j to i Accordingly, first hypothesis is  H1 Educational online social networking websites have stronger reciprocity levels of friendship relation than would be expected by chance  Theories of cognitive balance [11, 13 u gg e s t t e n d encies toward consistency in relations. According to these theories human networks have tendency toward transitivity Transitivity is the tendency for a tie from i to k to occur more frequently than by chance if there exist ties from i to j  and from j to k In friendship networks this captures the idea that my friend\222s friends tend to be my friends This is illustrated in Fig. 2\(a\d leads to the second hypothesis  H2 Educational online social networking websites have stronger transitivity levels of friendship relation than would be expected by chance  Granovetter's 'strength of weak ties' theory ar g u e d i n   d R o n Bu rt s t h eor y of s t ru ct u ral h o les 3], both sug gests that a tie from i to j is to occur more frequently than by chance if there exist ties from k to i and from k to j This captures the idea of the closure, suggesting that a person\222s    Figure 1.

It was found that all of the four hypothesized forces were present. Reciprocity and transitivity were found to be the strongest force in the network, followed by closure.

If all the bias events fail to occur the tie may still form with chance probability, depending on the density of the network.

pendent events. No tie forms only if all applicable events fail to occur, simultaneously. Probability that a tie fails to occur is, thus, the product that all relevant bias events fail to occur \(including the random chance of connection\. Relevant bias events for a particular tie depend on the ties that surround it. The biases are quantified trough bias parameters, which are the probabilities that corresponding bias events occur. Thus, the parameters vary between 0 and 1. In the case that all biases are 0, the result is what is expected in a random network with the same density. Parameters of the specific bias events can be estimated from models Random chance of connection \(density\n also be included in models as a bias event, as it was done in this paper In order to be able to test the proposed structural forces following bias events are incorporated in stochastic models for this research: density \(d\reciprocity \(r\sitivity \(t closure \(c\d similarity \(s A biased net model is specified by deriving the dyad census by conditioning on the rest of the network \(without considering the dyad in the qu estion\, as function of bias events.

Fitcolab is an online social networking website for the students of School of Information Technology in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Student population consists of regular, on-campus students, and online learning students. Fitcolab was officially launched on December 29 th 2007 This paper considers two datasets from Fitcolab. The first encompasses friendship links of all 1219 registered users \(excluding administrator and dummy accounts\ince the inception of the network until February 15 th 2009, and is denoted as FIT-ALL. The second dataset, denoted as FITNEW, considers freshman students who enrolled to their first year of studies in October 2008. Almost all of these students were registered to the online social network between October 14 th and October 19 th 2008. This dataset thus, consists of all the friendship links for 257 students since October 14 th 2008 until February 15 th 2009  Table 1: Dyadic outcome probabilities  1\(\1\(\1\(\1\(*\1\(\1\(\1\(\1\(\|1Pr 00 dstcdstc GD ij ij ij ij ji ij s t m s t m ij ij

The expression within the rectangular brackets refers to the probability of j 002 i tie being present, which is probabilistically represented as 1 minus the probability of j 002 i tie being absent. j 002 i will be absent \(its probability = 0\ if all of the following are satisfied: a\e closure event fails to occur, raised to the number of common parents of i and j b transitivity event fails to occur, raised to the number of the children of j who are parents of i c\similarity event fails to occur, raised to the power of the number of children of both i and j and d\dom chance of connection fails to occur The product, shown in the second equation after the closing rectangular expression, represents the missing i 002 j tie which is similar like the j 002 i tie, but includes also the bias for reciprocity; because of the existence of j 002 i tie As of yet, a maximum likelihood method for model estimation is not available for the family of biased net models. However, the models can be estimated by a pseudolikelihood method in the following manner. Let D ijuv denote a random variable corresponding to the state of ij dyad that takes on a value 1 if x ij u and x ji v. Then, the probability that D ijuv is unity will be the probability that the ij dyad takes on the value x ij u and x ji v, conditioning on all other dyads in the graph G ij th u and v being either 0 or 1 the pseudolikelihood function, as shown in t h e n  be defined as in \(1 Fit of the models can be assessed with pseudolikelihood ratio statistic, as shown in \(2

Although FIT-NEW is a subset of FIT-ALL, it can be considered as a separate network dataset, since its network boundaries are clear and naturally defined. It is a more homogenous network than FIT-ALL Additionally, the strength of individual bias parameters for FIT-NEW network dataset was analyzed longitudinally Five different observations were taken into account. First observation is from October 26 th 2008. Remaining four network snapshots are four weeks apart from each other starting from October 26 th and ending on February 15 th  2009 The friendship links in Fitc olab are directed, unlike in some of the popular online social networking websites such as Facebook. The datasets have been anonymized prior to the investigation Fitcolab was build on the top of Elgg, award winning open source social networking software. The author of this paper considerably modified and extended the software package in order to accommodat e it to its user population and to make it more competitive with other social networking websites VII  R ESULTS  A. Results of hypotheses tests The four proposed hypotheses were tested for both of the datasets. Baseline model for testing the hypothesis is the model that includes a single bias parameter \226 random chance of connection \(density\his model is denoted as Model 1. Eight additional models were examined, all of which included density and reciprocity biases. Previous investigations of both offline d on l i n e 4] s o ci al n e t works have indicated very strong reciprocity levels. This is the reason for inclusion of reciprocity bias in all but the baseline model. Model 2 includes density and reciprocity biases. Models 3-5 include density, reciprocity and one of the triadic biases. Models 6-8 include density, reciprocity and the combination of two of the triadic biases. Model 9 includes all of the proposed biases. The results of model fitting for FIT-NEW and FIT-ALL datasets are displayed in Table 2 and Table 3. Table cells contain values of estimated bias parameters and standard errors, which are shown in parentheses The best fitting model for both of the datasets is Model 9, the model that includes all of the effects: random chance of connection, reciprocity, transitivity, similarity, and closure. In all of the models, including the Model 9, all estimated parameters are more than twice the magnitude of the respective standard errors. This is an evidence for strong indication that all of the four hypothesized network biases are significantly different from zero It is noticeable that there are differences in magnitudes of individual biases. However, there is consistency across the two datasets in this respect, as in both cases the reciprocity is by far the strongest bias for the creation of the network ties, transitivity being the second strongest, followed by similarity and lastly, closure The best models from two different datasets also tell us that that reciprocity bias is somewhat stronger in FIT-ALL network, whereas all other biases are significantly weaker This might be because FIT-ALL is more diverse network consisting of the students of different grade levels and different enrolment generations All of the hypothesized biases are significantly larger than the density bias. Density bias, representing the random chance of connection, is 0.0012 in FIT-NEW and 0.0004 in FIT-ALL \(Model 9\. Observed densities for these two networks are 0.0134 and 0.0035. Thus, about 1/10 of all friendship ties in both datasets are created by random chance of connection, whereas ca. 9/10 of ties are generated as a result of before mentioned local micro-forces  Table 2: Parameter estimates together with respective standard errors \(shown in parentheses\nd the goodness of fit for FIT-NE W models, including density, reciprocity, transitivity, similarity and closure biases  FIT-NEW Density Reciproc.

Longitudinal analysis of biases Most of the work related to the macro structure of online social networking websites considers single static snapshots of these websites. In this paper, besides investigating micro structural forces, an additional step is made by studying how each of the individual forces behaves over the time This is studied on FIT-NEW, an evolving online social network of freshman students. FIT-NEW is a homogeneous social network dataset which was free of school activities Fig. 3 shows how the network density increased over the time, during the period of the data analysis. Network density increases rapidly until somewhere between the second November 23 rd d third \(December 21 st observation. Afterwards network density continues to increase, but slowly   Figure 3: Network density of FIT-NEW over the time  The large majority of all of the users from this dataset were registered during the first few days of this network existence. It seems that most users created the large portions of their friend-lists before the third observation point \(during the first 9 weeks of FIT-NEW\. The fact that the network ties were much more intensely created at the beginning, and less intensely afterwards, reflected on the longitudinal movements of magnitudes of bias parameters Density bias \(random chance of connection\, not to be confused with the density of the network, was stable during the investigation, as shown in Fig. 4. Reciprocity bias has shown tendency to increase with the time. Fig. 5 shows the magnitude variation of the reciprocity. It was found that there was decreasing tendency over the time for transitivity and similarity biases, as displayed in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Very interesting results have been obtained for the closure bias From the first to the second observation point the closure dropped almost threefold, just to start steadily increasing from the second observation point onwards. This longitudinal patterning is displayed in Fig. 8    Figure 4: Density bias of FIT-NEW network over the time   Figure 5: Reciprocity bias of FIT-NEW network over the time 2009 Third IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Techn\ologies \(IEEE DEST 2009 609 
 


    Figure 6: Transitivity bias of FIT-NEW network over the time   Figure 7: Similarity bias of FIT-NEW network over the time   Figure 8: Closure bias of FIT-NEW network over the time  VIII  C ONCLUSION  Based upon communication and social theories, this work proposed and tested hypotheses for four micro structural forces that create friendship structure in online social networking websites. Two network datasets from an educational online social network were used for the empirical investigation. Nine stochastic models, each incorporating different combination of micro structural forces, were built and compared, using recently reformulated bias net theory. Hypotheses for all of the processes were confirmed. Best fitting model was found to be the one which incorporated all of the proposed forces. Reciprocity is the strongest force acting in the network, followed by transitivity, similarity and finally closure. Longitudinal analysis showed the evolution of individual forces and the network density. Irregularity of the closure bias needs to be further investigated IX  R EFERENCES  1  Y. Y. Ahn, S. Han, H.

 9   These parameters were calculated using the relations  Analysis of Model A and B  Since both models A and B had same wave deflection angle the analysis gave similar results  For M 1 1.73, ratio of specific heats 1.4 and 12 degrees the ratio of pressure after and before the shock was calculated to be 1.920  The Mach number after the shock was found to be 1.25, it shows that it is still in supersonic regime and therefore the oblique shock formed is a weak oblique shock  Wave angle is also given by the sum of the Mach angle  and small angular difference Therefore      Here is given by the relation   1 1 2 4 \(M 1 2 226 1    That is, for a finite deflection angle the direction of weak oblique shock wave differs from the Mach wave direction  by an amount which is of the same order as   The Mach wave direction was calculated as 35 degrees and was calculated to be around 12 degrees. Sum of these two parameters gave the wave angle to be 40 degrees This is in good accordance with the experimental analysis of Models A and B, which is about 50 degrees  Pressure and temperature before and after the shocks were calculated from the isentropic relationships as the flow was assumed to be isentropic. The following values were determined  P1 = 0.197 bar = 19.7kPa P2 = 0.38 bar = 38kPa  T1 = 187.8 K T2 = 228.6 K  Analysis of Model C  Detached shock was observed near the nose of Model C This shock resulted as the wall deflection angle was greater than max Model C had was designed to have a blunt nose. In such a case, the shock wave remains detached at all supersonic Mach numbers. The flow immediately behind the shock was subsonic. It was difficult to determine the sonic line  The analysis of the flow fiel d associated with detached shock becomes very difficult because of transonic flow which prevails behind the shock. In such a case, the shape of the shock was observed and the detachment distance was determined. It becomes co mplicated to measure the properties in such rarefied flows. Hence the following parameters were found  The detachment distance was found to be 0.3cm from the nose of the model and the shape of the detached shock resembled conventional detached shock wave. However oblique shocks were noticed towards the downstream flow over the model as marked in the picture. The strength of the detached shock waves weakens with the formation of the oblique shock and further weakens until it becomes a Mach line, far away from the object. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of rectangular windows the entire section of the model could not be studied  6. F LUENT S OFTWARE A NALYSIS   Fluent is a general purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. Fluent technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. Th is software was chosen to compute, analyze and model the flow conditions in and around moving models  The wind tunnel models were modeled in Gambit software package and two dimensional analyses was done. Two dimensional analyses were to simplify the complexities arising from turbulent flow model analysis. The top and side views of the models were meshed using Gambit and were exported to Fluent to model the flow conditions  The 2ddp version in Fluent was used. The flow was modeled using density based solver, k-epsilon viscous model was used and properties of air were assumed to be constant. The analysis was done for normal supersonic cruising conditions at 50000 ft at a pressure of 12000 Pa and temperature 216 K. The Mach number was set to about 1.8 for analyzing Model A and B and sonic Mach number for Model C  Analysis of Model B  The top and sectional side views of the model were plotted and meshed using Gambit mesh solver. The mesh was imported in Fluent and the operating conditions were set as stated in the previous paragraphs. The analysis gave contours of pressure, temperat ure, velocity, Mach number and turbulence      
 


 10    The above contour shows static pressure distribution across the model. It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
