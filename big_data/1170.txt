detecting adverse drug reactions ADRs from drugs is that they may not be obvious until long after they are widely prescribed Part of the problem is these events are rare This work describes an approach to signal detection of ADRs based on association rules AR in Australian drug safety data This work was carried out using the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee ADRAC database which contains a hundred and thirty seven thousand records collected in 1972-2001 period Many signal detection methods have been developed for drug safety data most of which use a classical statistical approach Some of these stratify the data using an ontology for reactions t the application of drug ontologies to ADR signal detection methods has not been reported We propose a novel approach for detecting various signal levels by using an overlapped windowing approach The overlapping windows help to detect smooth transition of signal We use association rules for measuring signi\223cant change over time for different hierarchical levels of drugs using the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical ATC system of drug classi\223cation ontology and their reactions based on the System Organ Classes SOC ontology Using association rules and their strength for different levels in the drug and reaction hierarchy helps in the detection of signals at particular levels in higher order using a bottom up approach The results of a reliminary investigation of ADRAC data using our method demonstrate that this approach could produce a powerful and robust ADR signal detection method I I NTRODUCTION Post-marketing safety databases are large sparse full of biased uncontrolled and incomplete data The detection of unknown and unexpected connections between drug exposure and adverse events AEs is one of the major challenges of pharmacovigilance r the identi\223cation of possible connections in large databases automated statistical systems have been introduced with promising results From the large numbers of associations so produced the human mind has to identify signals that are likely to be important in need of further assessment and follow-up and that may require regulatory action Man y approaches ha v e been tried for the analysis of adverse reaction data such as Fisher\220s Exact Test and matched pair designs McNemar\220s test Reporting Odds Ratio ROR and Yule\220s Q Recently  r e gulatory authorities drug monitoring centers and pharmaceutical companies have directed more attention to the development implementation  and deployment of computer-assisted signal detection systems The three most commonly used methods with the greatest published experience are proportional reporting ratios PRRs  6 an application of empiric Baysean screening EBS known as the mulit-item gamma Poisson shrinker MGPS  7 8 and the Bayesian con\223dence propag ation neural network BCPNN 9 The Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee ADRAC database has been developed and maintained by the Therapeutic Goods Administration TGA with the aim to detect signals from adverse drug reactions ADRs as early as possible The ADRAC data contain 137,297 voluntarily reported adverse drug reaction records involving 5057 different drugs based on the 217drug dictionary\220 used by ADRAC of 7416 available drug terms and 868 different reactions based on 1392 available reaction terms There are many 223elds in the ADRAC database including report date and 223elds containing drug and reaction terms There are two groups of ten 223elds which are allocated for drug terms and reaction terms A more detailed account of the ADRAC database is n n A Data Consolidation The biggest challenge in summarizing safety data is the need to consolidate the massive amount of data into a manageable format One way s o group the safety data into K classes characterized by body systems and determined in conjunction with underlying disease and treatments involved Such pooling of data through coding is especially helpful for rare events  12 The W orld Health Or g anization WHO maintains such a classi\223cation of reaction terms These are groups of adverse reaction preferred terms pertaining to the same systems n class SOC The Australian drug safety data maintained by ADRAC uses WHO ADR terms and SOC grouping see 14 15 F o r more details of SOC information in ADRAC see There has been a need for a similar kind of grouping to apply to drugs in the ADRAC data which are currently listed by trade name In these data some of these trade names were assigned anatomical-therapeutic-chemical classi\223cation ATC codes by ADRAC t in cases where the trade name had more than one ingredient ATC codes were not assigned This paper applies an ad hoc classi\223cation made by us where each trade name code was assigned a corresponding Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Computati onal Intelligence for Modelling, Control and

ATC code The classi\223cation system implemented was the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology ATC codes in order to enable i the grouping of the same substance into one code and ii the grouping of related substances into more general categories To this purpose the ATC codes for drugs have been purchased by us from Ms Kirsten Myhr RELIS 330st Ullev 034 al University Hospital 0407 OSLO http://www.whocc.no B ATC embedded code The ATC encoding system implements an an embedded encoding system which employs a seven character coding system As an example the 223rst member of the system will be used The l we call l 0 the character is 217A\220 the l 1 is 217A01\220 l 2 is 217A01A\220 l 3 is 217A01AA\220 and l 4 is 217A01AA01\220 The embedded coding can be utilized to simplify database queries and algorithm coding Employing this embedded coding which resides in the ATC code string can be now utilized to aggregate the data at the required level C Classi\223cation of ADRAC data for this analysis For the purposes of this present investigation in cases where the original drug code had more than one ingredient a unique code was assigned from ATC codes for combinations of ingredients This was done in order to preserve a one-toone correspondence between original drug codes and the ATC codes facilitating comparison of the two drug classi\223cation schema This resulted in 1806 ATC drug terms from the 5081 drug trade name terms There are 223ve evels of classes in the ATC system l 0 had 14 classes l 1 had 95 l 2 had 217 l 3 had 581 and l 4 had 1785 D Critical Terms From the third quarter of 1998 a ew 223eld has been added at the end of the WHO-ART 223le which indicates Critical Terms Critical terms are a subset of adverse reaction terms referring to or possibly being indicative of serious disease states which have been regarded as particularly important to follow up  This is a v ery important component of e xpert kno wledge which can be incorporated into the ADR signal detection In this report we weight critical reaction terms to highlight associations which are likely to be of greater interest and particularly those that are rare E Motivation Automated signal detection and data mining techniques are evolving rapidly but several outstanding issues remain problematic These include the absence of a gold standard against which to evaluate signal detection methods lack of validation and comprehensive head-to-head comparisons of the various methods lack of transparency f the Bayesianbased methods lack of best practices or recommended data mining protocols the in\224uence of AE dictionary structure on performance characteristics limited speci\223city and potential for misapplication of these techniques In one study there were 136 relevant DECs that triggered safety-related labelling changes for 39 drugs during a 7-month period PRRs generated a signal of disproportionate reporting with almost twice as many drug-event combinations DECs as MGPS 77 versus 40 DECs generating signals of disproportionate reporting with only PRRs were both medically serious and non-serious No medically important events were signalled by MGPS only  Other dif 223culties with MGPS are 215signal leakage\216 in which a signal truly associated with drug A may manifest as an apparent signal with drug B due to the fact that the two drugs are frequently co-prescribed and 215signal masking\216 whereby a signal for drug A can be diminished in magnitude if drug B has a very dominant signal in the database Some of the logic for example triage logic for signal selection and follow-up are discussed in relation to UMC data by Meyboom et al  and St 036 ahl et al  22 Therefore there is still more work to be done in the ADR signalling methodology II M ETHOD AND R ESULTS A Aim The aim of this paper is to present the developments in our approach to developing an ADR signalling method We use the SOC reaction term and ATC drug term hierarchies to establish drug-reaction associations by traversal of the ATC tree where reaction frequencies are signi\223cant based on Chi-Square 205 002 2  The algorithm then surveys the temporal reporting of these reactions using a varying time window which smooths monthly variation and seeks to 223nd frequent associations also using the 002 2 test of a critical nature The algorithm then generates a report on the signal status of this reaction set B Research Methodology 1 The association between drug/class and reactions Among many different techniques used to extract useful knowledge from databases Association Rule mining has in recent years attracted the attention of data mining communities Association rule mining is a form of data mining used to r interesting relationships amongst two or more attributes in data Association rules were introduced by Agrawal et al and originated with the problem of supermark et basket analysis In basket analysis association rules were used to 223nd associations between the items bought by a customer in order to 223nd which items were frequently bought together The 223ndings can be used to understand customers\220 buying habits and preferences in order to increase pro\223ts An association rule is an expression of the form X 002 Y support  where X and Y are sets of items that are often found together in a iven collection of data The attribute group on the left hand side of the arrow s called the antecedent or 215left hand side\216 LHS and the group of attributes on the right hand side of the arrow s called the consequent or 215right hand side\216 RHS While association rules have n o be useful in practical applications AR algorithms tend to generate large numbers of rules most of which are of little interest In order to 223lter uninteresting rules the interesetingness and usefulness of an association rule has been based on user de\223ned support and con\223dence thresholds Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Computati onal Intelligence for Modelling, Control and Automation, and Inter national Conference on Intelligent Agents, Web Technologies and Internet Commerce \(CIMCA-IAWTIC\22205

If both support and con\223dence values are greater than the threshold the association rule is considered interesting The support is the percentage of rows in the database containing both X and Y  In this study we do not use support as a measure of interestingness because higher support will 223lter out rare associations In many real life applications some items appear frequently in the data while others rarely appear If we use support as a measure of interesetingness those rules that involve rare items will not be found The con\223dence is the conditional probability of Y n X for example con\223dence  P  Y  X   Our method seeks to 223nd if there exists any association between any particular drug or drug class and a set of critical reactions using a tree structure For example an association rule R1 drug  M01AH01 002 reaction  636 con\223dence 35 means that 35 of patients who took drug M01AH01 Celecoxib had reaction with code 636 hypertension This association can also be represented as conditional probability P  reaction  636  drug  M 01 AH 01 In this study the traditional AR approach is not directly used We organize generated association rules by separating the discovered rules into rule sets Each rule set contains association rules that share a common consequent r example association rules drug  M01 002 cardiovascular reactions and drug  M02 002 cardiovascular reactions represent a rule set because they share the same consequent We generate the tree using a breadth 223rst search The root of the tree denotes the top drug class l for example M and children nodes denote a subclass of the parent node for example M01 M02 and M03 and s denote a particular drug for example M01AH01 During traversal of the tree we 223nd if another l f the tree needs to be generated according to our rgence criteria The details of our algorithm are as follows Step 1 We select the top drug class and and a reaction class of interest r example we select drug class M and reaction class 205 cardiovascular reactions SOC1000  Step 2 We generate the next l f the drug class as child nodes of the tree We 223nd the set f children for the drug classes that are associated with the selected reaction class r example for drug class M e 223nd children M01 M02 M03 and M04 and then for each child we generate group of association rules for class 205 cardiovascular reactions SOC1000 R1 drug  M01 002 cardiovascular reactions R2 drug  M02 002 cardiovascular reactions R3 drug  M03 002 cardiovascular reactions R4 drug  M04 002 cardiovascular reactions If the discrepancy between the con\223dence values of these association rules is substantially high this group is considered different on the basis of cardiovascular reactions otherwise the group is considered similar f the group is considered different by using the 002 2 test we 223nd if there is a signi\223cant difference in frequencies We generate a contingency table containing frequencies and calculate the chi-square value If we 223nd                      Fig 1 Tree traversal of signal algorithm signi\223cant differences we choose child\(ren with maximum frequency Figure 1 illustrates breadth search steps Figure 1 depicts such a traversal For example if drug class M is chosen the children M01 M02 M03 M04 M05 M09 are examined M01 is found to be signi\223cant so its children M01A M01B M01C are examined M01A is found to be signi\223cant so its children M01AA M01AB M01AC M01AE M01AG M01AH M011AX are examined M01AH is found to be signi\223cant so its children M01AH01 M01AH02 are examined M01AH01 see Figure 2 where reaction class SOC1000 was chosen is found to be signi\223cant The algorithm terminates at this leaf Step 3 We continue the above step 2 until 200 the lowest l f drug class is found or 200 002 2 test fails This means that this particular drug class l s responsible for the reactions Once search process terminates we generate association rules for drug\(s and adverse reactions A drug can be either drug class for example M01AH or drug for example M01AH01 Adverse reactions ADR are reactions belonging to the same reaction class r example ADR 67 68,104 belong to cardiovascular reaction class SOC1000 as illustrated in Figure 2 Association rules displayed in Figure 2 are used for descriptive purposes r examplethe highest bar Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Computati onal Intelligence for Modelling, Control and Automation, and Inter national Conference on Intelligent Agents, Web Technologies and Internet Commerce \(CIMCA-IAWTIC\22205 0-7695-2504-0/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

Fig. 5. FP-tree for the database TDB in TableI nodes of theFP-tree In the next scan, the set of sorted \(frequency descending order prefix-tree as a branch. The root node of the tree is labeled with "null", every other node in theFP-tree additionally stores a counter which keeps track of the number of itemsets that share that node. When the frequent items are sorted in their frequency descending order, there are better chances that more prefixes can be shared, thus theFP-tree representation of the database can be kept as small as possible The compact transaction database and CT-tree data structure introduced in the previous sections are very different from above approaches. First of all, the prefix-tree andFP-tree data structure are constructed in the main memory to optimize the frequent pattern mining process, whereas CT-tree is designed to generate compact transaction database and store it to disk for efficient frequent pattern mining and othermining process in which compact database can save storage space and reduce mining time In addition, the counter associated with each node in the prefix-tree and FP-tree stores the number of transaction containing the itemset represented by the path from the root to the node. However, each path from every node of the CT-tree to the root represents a unique transaction, and the associated counter records the number of occurrences of this transaction in the original transaction database Moreover, for a given transaction database, the number of nodes and node-links in FP-tree will change with different minimum support threshold specified by the user. But there is only one unchanged CT-tree for every transaction database And the FP-tree structure can be constructed from a compact transaction database more efficiently in only one database scan, since the head part of a compact transaction database lists all items in frequency descending order, and the body part stores all ordered transactions associated with their occurrence counts VII. CONCLUSIONS We have proposed an innovative approach to generating compact transaction databases for efficient frequent pattern mining. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by the experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets. It can not only reduce the number of transactions in the original databases and save storage space but also greatly reduce theI/O time required by database scans and improve the efficiency of the mining process We have assumed in this paper that the CT-tree data structure will fit into main memory. However, this assumption will not apply for very large databases. In that case, we plan to partition original databases into several small parts until the corresponding CT-tree can be fit in the available memory. This work is currently in progress VIII.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
