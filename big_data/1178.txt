each active normal system behavior and doesn't mistake the normal connection thus only the suspicious connections would be      analyzed more than 80 packets are normal and don't need behavior fre tsio behavior etc.aIs nextensibilit n processing influence to the system speed is very littlea All the aptility aew asoec rit y network compution information of the host computer is combined to a union and the environment New system security holes and imtrusion properties are expanded and enhancedfor the data mining engine methods are continuously being discovered so it's imperative so the mining process 
is efficient and accurate Fuzzy mining also that IDSs be update frequently and timely IDS relied on the be used in intrusion detecting and rule sets comparing The system builder's hand code intuition and experience are out of framework provides abilities of detection report and response fashion and their updates are expensive and slow Speed is Experimental results show the rapidness and accuracy of the another standard of IDS it runs the faster the better proposedframework By amending the algorithm of data mining is not the best way to improve the speed and accuracy of IDS system The more appreciate thing is 
how to find suspicious connection I INTRODUCTION immediately and make a quick evaluation In order to meet these requirements a new framework is Intrusion detection can be defined as identifying designed unauthorized use misuse and abuse of computer system by both inside and outside intruders Intrusion detection System II SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE IDS can be categorized into anomaly detection and misuse detection 1 Anomaly detection systems assume that an A Introduction of The Main Layers intrusion should deviate the system behavior from its normal The framework consists of 5 main layers as bellow pattern Misuse detection systems assume that an intrusion 
can Data source layer In other IDS data mining uses only the be detected by matching the current activity with a set of basic properties of traffic packets such as timestamp source intrusion patterns and destination IP service type packet size etc In fact this After decades of development data mining technology is kind of mining neglected the relationship between the net successfully used in intrusion detection system traffic packets and the state of host computer it can't find rules Association rule mining is very important data min'n mg 
between host state and net links no matter how many efforts technique A typical example of an association rule mined had been made some other properties should be expanded into from audit data can be ftp->get 0.4,0 1 witch implies 40 of the mining process the time when the user use ftp command get command is also Misuse detecting layer this layer can detect known invoked and doing so constitutes 10 of the command issued intrusion by comparing the activities with the intrusion by the user Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant 2 patters in knowledge database with high speed 
and accuracy use apriori algorithm to mine association rules It needs a regularly updated pattern database very much The W Lee SJ Stolfo and KW Mok 3 utilized association rule layer consists of system log miner protocol analyzer and mining and frequent episode mining to mine rules from system corresponding knowledge database the knowledge database is audit data to form a normal profile partly the trained result with DARPA2000 data sets and it can Partitioning quantitative audit data into intervals may cause be maintained by the IDC too The biggest data source of sharp boundary problem 
during mining Tow adjacent data values may be mined as two different types normal/abnormal protocol analyzer can decode the traffic packets in different for having different support values Consequently an intrusive depth such as no decoding head decoding middle decoding pattern with a small variance may remain undetected To over a c dcIng t dcI wa ne differen come this problem fuzzy data mining was employed fortieadgtifrntnomto,i'sctoldbyheIC intrusion detection in 4 where quantitative features are categorized into categories having fuzzy membership values After studying the existing work repeatedly we found there 1-4244-0020-1/05/$20.OO a2005 IEEE 1 of 4

Manager manages the agreed proposals and provides necessary information for the process of derived data generation The Template Generators generate templates based on the proposals A template is similar to a multi-resolution cache object 10 and a n X SL stylesheet 13   I t c ontains information for the Data Generators to generate different 221views\222 based on different p ermissions to the levels of behavior logs For example a simple ACL Template Generator can be implemented by attaching ACL s Access Control Lists to raw data on which derived data depend In addition an ACL Filter can be developed to 036lter out unauthorized components from the template produced by the ACL Template Generator To illustrate suppose a derived data 000 002 004 006 002 t 013 depends on the raw data 002 r 006 002 020 and 002 021 where 002 004 023 002 r 025 002 020  and 002 t 023 030 031 002 033  When a template about the pair is generated the ACL Template Generator attaches the ACLs of 002 r and 002 020 to 002 004  and the ACL of 002 021 to 002 t  If a requester wishes to obtain the pair but he has no permission to view 002 r then 002 004 will be 036ltered out and only 002 t is provided For some applications rather than 036ltering out entirely a component of a derived data a more sophisticated template may be developed to leave the component but removing the effect of the raw data on which the component depends but a requester has no permission to view it This will be left to our future work 7 Future Work Other than a concrete implementation of DDS there are many interesting things left to be done st we observe that this paper focuses on user behaviors in using services in cyberspace Similar methods may be used to develop a framework for studying user behaviors in more general applications Secondly current design in DDS does not consider storage limitation The retention of outdated logs and their destruction time may be considered to save storage space Third XQuery is u sed in DDS for derived data de\036nition However XQuery provides only simple aggregate functions such as sum count min max etc More complicated data mining functions such as 036nding association rules or sequence patterns may be included Finally in case a user wishes to manually modify the generated derived data should such modi\036cation be allowed If so should requesters be aware of such modi\036cation and how References  G  A dom a v icius a nd A  T u zhilin U s i ng data m i ning m e thods to b u ild customer pro\036 les Computer  34\(2 Feb 2001  R  M  A rlein B J a i M J a k obs s

the initial global candidate set would be similar to the set of global MFIs. As a result, during the global mining phase the communication and synchronization overhead is low  0 2 4 6 8 1 0 Number of Nodes Figure 5. Speedup of DMM 4.4.2 Sizeup For the sizeup test, we fixed the system to the 8-node con figuration, and distributed each database listed in Table 2 to the 8 nodes. Then, we increased the local database sire at each node from 45 MB to 215 MB by duplicating the initial database partition allocated to the node. Thus, the data distribution characteristics remained the same as the local database size was increased. This is different from the speedup test, where the database repartitioning was per formed when the number of nodes was increased. The per formance of DMM is affected by the database repartitioning to some extent, although it is usually very small. During the sizeup test, the local mining result of DMM is not changed at all at each node The results shown in Figure 6 indicate that DMM has a very good sizeup property. Since increasing the size of local database did not affect the local mining result of DMM at each node, the total execution time increased just due to more disk U 0  and computation cost which scaled almost linearly with sizeup 5 Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a new parallel maximal fre quent itemset \(MFI Max-Miner \(DMM tems. DMM is a parallel version of Max-Miner, and it re quires low synchronization and communication overhead compared to other parallel algorithms. In DMM, Max Miner is applied on each database partition during the lo 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 Amwnt of Data per Node \(ME Figure 6. Sizeup of DMM cal mining phase. Only one synchronization is needed at thc end of this phase to construct thc initial global candi date set. In the global mining phase, a top-down search is performed on the candidate set, and a prefix tree is used to count the candidates with different length efficiently. Usu ally, just a few passes are needed to find all global maximal frequent itemsets. Thus, DMM largely reduces the number of synchronizations required between processing nodes Compared with Count Distribution, DMM shows a great improvement when some frequent itemscts are large \(i.e long patterns employed by DMM for efficient communication between nodes; and global support estimation, subset-infrequency based pruning, and superset-frequency based pruning are used to reduce the size of global candidate set.

sketch-index in answering aggregate queries. Then Section 5.2 studies the effect of approximating spatiotemporal data, while Section 5.3 presents preliminary results for mining association rules 5.1 Performance of sketch-indexes Due to the lack of real spatio-temporal datasets we generate synthetic data in a way similar to [SJLL00 TPS03] aiming at simulation of air traffic. We first adopt a real spatial dataset [Tiger] that contains 10k 2D points representing locations in the Long Beach county \(the data space is normalized to unit length on each dimension These points serve as the  airbases  At the initial timestamp 0, we generate 100k air planes, such that each plane \(i uniformly generated in [200,300], \(ii, iii destination that are two random different airbases, and iv  the velocity direction is determined by the orientation of the line segment connecting its source and destination airbases move continually according to their velocities. Once a plane reaches its destination, it flies towards another randomly selected also uniform in [0.02, 0.04 reports to its nearest airbase, or specifically, the database consists of tuples in the form &lt;time t, airbase b, plane p passenger # a&gt;, specifying that plane p with a passengers is closest to base b at time t A spatio-temporal count/sum query has two parameters the length qrlen of its query \(square number qtlen of timestamps covered by its interval. The actual extent of the window \(interval uniformly in the data space \(history, i.e., timestamps 0,100 air planes that report to airbases in qr during qt, while a sum query returns the sum of these planes  passengers. A workload consists of 100 queries with the same parameters qrlen and qtlen The disk page size is set to 1k in all cases \(the relatively small page size simulates situations where the database is much more voluminous specialized method for distinct spatio-temporal aggregation, we compare the sketch-index to the following relational approach that can be implemented in a DBMS. Specifically, we index the 4-tuple table lt;t,b,p,a&gt; using a B-tree on the time t column. Given a count query \(with window qr and interval qt SELECT distinct p FROM &lt;t,b,p,a&gt WHERE t?qt &amp; b contained in qr The performance of each method is measured as the average number of page accesses \(per query processing a workload. For the sketch-index, we also report the average \(relative Specifically, let acti and esti be the actual and estimated results of the i-th query in the workload; then the error equals \(1/100 set the number of bits in each sketch to 24, and vary the number of sketches The first experiment evaluates the space consumption Figure 5.1 shows the sketch index size as a function of the number of sketches used \(count- and sum-indexes have the same results more sketches are included, but is usually considerably smaller than the database size \(e.g., for 16 signatures, the size is only 40% the database size 0 20 40 60 80

Figure 5.2a illustrates the costs of both algorithms for countworkloads with qtlen=10 and various qrlen \(the index used in this case has 16 sketches also illustrate the performance of the relational method which, however, is clearly incomparable \(for qrlen?0.1, it is worse by an order of magnitude we omit this technique Sketch-pruning always outperforms na  ve \(e.g., eventually two times faster for qrlen=0.25 increases with qrlen, since queries returning larger results tend to set bits in the result sketch more quickly, thus enhancing the power of Heuristics 3.1 and 3.2. In Figure 5.2b, we compare the two methods by fixing qrlen to 0.15 and varying qtlen. Similar to the findings of [PTKZ02]4 both algorithms demonstrate  step-wise  growths in their costs, while sketch-pruning is again significantly faster The experiments with sum-workloads lead to the same observations, and therefore we evaluate sketch-indexes using sketch-pruning in the rest of the experiments 4 As explained in [PTKZ02], query processing accesses at most two paths from the root to the leaf level of each B-tree regardless the length of the query interval Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE sketch-pruning naive relational 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 number of disk accesses query rectangle length 300 0 100 200 400 500 600 1 5 10 15 20 number of disk accesses query interval length a qtlen=10 b qrlen=0.15 Figure 5.2: Superiority of sketch-pruning \(count As discussed in Section 2, a large number of sketches reduces the variance in the resulting estimate.

For comparison, we index the table using a 3D R*-tree on the columns time, x, and y. Given a query, this tree facilitates the retrieval of all qualifying tuples, after which a post-processing step is performed to obtain the Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE number of distinct planes \(in the sequel, we refer to this method as 3DR method introduces a regular res  res grid of the data space, where the resolution res is a parameter. We adopt 16 sketches because, as mentioned earlier, this number gives the best overall performance Figure 5.5 compares the sizes of the resulting sketch indexes \(obtained with resolutions res=25, 50, 100 the database size. In all cases, we achieve high compression rate \(e.g., the rate is 25% for res=25 evaluate the query efficiency, we first set the resolution to the median value 50, and use the sketch index to answer workloads with various qrlen \(qtlen=10

The sketch index is faster than 3DR by an order of magnitude \(note that the vertical axis is in logarithmic scale around 15% error observations using workloads with different qtlen Finally, we examine the effect of resolution res using a workload with qrlen=0.15 and qtlen=10. As shown in Figure 5.6c, larger res incurs higher query overhead, but improves the estimation accuracy Summary: The proposed sketch method can be used to efficiently approximate spatio-temporal data for aggregate processing. It consumes significantly smaller space, and answers a query almost in real-time with low error 3D Rsketch number of disk accesses query rectangle length 1 10 100 1k 10k 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 16 14% 15 15% 13 relative error number of disk accesses query interval length 1 10 100 1k 10k 1 5 10 15 20 16 15% 15% 12% 11 relative error a qtlen=10, res=25 b qrlen=0.15, res=25 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 25 50 100 number of disk accesses resolution 20% 15% 14 relative error c qrlen=0.15, qtlen=10

We execute our algorithms \(using 16 sketches these rules, and measure \(i  correct  rules divided by the total number of discovered rules, and \(ii successfully mined Figures 5.7a and 5.7b illustrate the precision and recall as a function of T respectively. Our algorithm has good precision \(close to 90 majority of the rules discovered are correct.

Conclusions While efficient aggregation is the objective of most spatio-temporal applications in practice, the existing solutions either incur prohibitive space consumption and query time, or are not able to return useful aggregate results due to the distinct counting problem. In this paper we propose the sketch index that integrates traditional approximate counting techniques with spatio-temporal indexes. Sketch indexes use a highly optimized query algorithm resulting in both smaller database size and faster query time. Our experiments show that while a sketch index consumes only a fraction of the space required for a conventional database, it can process 


required for a conventional database, it can process queries an order of magnitude faster with average relative error less than 15 While we chose to use FM sketches, our methodology can leverage any sketches allowing union operations Comparing the efficiency of different sketches constitutes a direction for future work, as well as further investigation of more sophisticated algorithms for mining association rules. For example, heuristics similar to those used for searching sketch indexes may be applied to improve the brute-force implementation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Yufei Tao and Dimitris Papadias were supported by grant HKUST 6197/02E from Hong Kong RGC.
