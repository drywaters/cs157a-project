Association rules have proved their influence in different industrial fields, where their goal is to identify the relations existing among the events that are stored in large databases However, in order to enumerate the association rules, there is a need to identify the frequent set of itemsets \(i.e. those events that occur together in a sufficient number of

transactions\. In this paper, a new representation structure for the data stored in any transactional database is proposed This structure, which we refer to as Positional Lexicographic Tree \(PLT\, provides an efficient mechanism  for subset checking based on a summary of the data extracted from the database. This makes PLT a promising tool for most of the existing data mining approaches. Moreover, our proposed PLT structure regulates the data in the database so that they can be applicable to compression and indexing techniques which makes PLT suitable for supporting large databases First, we introduce the PLT construction process, then 
highlight the different mining approaches that can be modulated to take advantage of PLT. We then present our algorithm and finally prove its correctness 
Recent developments in information technology have allowed a massive amount of data to be generated and stored in large databases. These enormous databases create a challenge in terms of discovering hidden patterns presented in the data; these patterns cannot be discovered using the traditional query languages associated with the current database management systems, and are important in that they

can improve the decision-making process Data mining has received a great deal of attention in recent years within the database community, where different data mining techniques have been proposed to extract hidden patterns from large databases. Among many interesting domains of data mining, transactional databases of supermarkets have been the focus of many researchers, where each record of these databases contains information such as the transaction identifier the date of the transaction, the set of items bought in that particular transaction, and possibly the customer 
identifier. A data mining problem in this context is mining the association rules; this problem was first introduced in [1   Th es e r u l es g i v e a n  i d ea o f t h e s et o f  items that can be bought within the same transaction An example of such rules might be that 95 % of customers who buy item 
X Y 
are willing to buy item in the same transaction \(95% is the support of the rule Generating all the association rules will help mangers make decisions about their business, such as which items should be placed next to or near each other catalog design, customers\220 buying habits, and butting 
items on sale. In addition, association rules have been applied to other domains such as medical data and web page access habits Theoretically, if we have a set of 
n 2 n n 
relations to exist among these events; these relations are used to formulate the association rules. In order to compute the support of the rules, the set of relations should be checked against the database to determine the frequency of each relation; for large 
events \(items there is a potential for 
this huge search space will degrade the performance of any algorithm designed to 
solve this problem. Another dimension that adds more computational costs to the overall process is the large size of the database, which must be scanned several times in order to generate the frequencies. All of the algorithms in the literature tried to utilize different heuristics and pruning techniques in order to efficiently determine the set frequent relations \(a relation is frequent if its frequency is greater than the user\220s predefined threshold The problem of the association rules can be divided into two steps [1  I n t h e f i r s t s t e p t h e s e t o f ite ms e t s  
itemset and relation refer to the same concept\ that exceeds a predefined threshold are determined; these itemsets are called frequent. In the second step, the association rules are determined from this set of frequent itemsets. In this paper, we introduce a new representation for the data stored in the database; this new representation takes the form of a lexicographic

Our enhancement is in the way in which this representation makes subset checking a light process, as well as the applicability of this data to compression and indexing techniques This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a formula definition for frequent itemset generation. Section 3 surveys some of the existing methods. Section 4 defines our new representation for the data \(the positional lexicographic tree\. Section 5 illustrates the construction and mining procedure Section 6 concludes the paper itemset. A transaction if if Several algorithms in the literature proposed to attack the problem of mining frequent itemsets from large databases; these algorithms differ mainly in the way in which they represent the database and in the way in which they generate the frequent itemsets    As defined in  t h e p r o b l e m of m i n i ng association rules can be formulated as follows: Let  Let   where The association rules are implications of the form and if each transaction of the transactions that contain also contain items is called of the transactions in T X D 002 We say that the rule has a confidence 006 1 Through this paper we will refer to the support as the number of transactions that contain the itemset rather than ratio These algorithms can be classified into two main approaches: the candidate generation approach and the pattern growth approach. In terms of these approaches the algorithms also differ in the way in which they represent the database. The two most popular formats are vertical layout, where each item is  associated with the list of transaction identifiers where it was occurred and horizontal layout, where each transaction identifier is  associated with the list of items The candidate generation approach enumerates the frequent itemsets in a level wise manner, with several scans for the database. In each iteration, the itemsets found to be frequent are used to generate the candidate possible frequent itemsets\o be counted in the next iteration. Within this approach are the AIS algorithm 1  A pr i or i  A pr i o r i I d  a n d A pr i or i H y p r i d 2   D H P  Directed Hashing and Pruning\ [5   th e P ar t it i o n  algorithm  a n d D IC \(D y n a m i c It e m s e t Co un t i n g  7  Th e m o s t p o p u l a r al g o r i th m o f t h e ca n d i d at e generation approach is the Apriori. Others except AIS are optimization of Apriori In the Apriori algorithm, a database scan is conducted in order to determine the set of frequent items. From this set of items it then generates a candidate set to be counted in the next step by joining the set of frequent itemset found to be frequent in the current pass. In addition, it prunes the set of candidate based on the anti monotone property, which states that all subsets of frequent itemsets should be frequent in order to eliminate candidates that have at least one infrequent subset. This process is repeated a number of times equal to the size of the largest frequent itemset The pattern growth approach tries to avoid the large number of candidates generated in each pass and overcome the repeated scans of the database, which makes most of the algorithms in this approach to outperform most of the candidate generation approach algorithms The core algorithm of the pattern growth approach is the Frequent Pattern growth \(FP-growth\ proposed by Han et al, [3  I n t h is me t h o d  t h e d a tab as e is  converted to a compact representation in the form of a tree called Frequent Pattern tree \(FP-tree\, which is much smaller in size than the original database. The FP-tree is constructed in such a way that all relevant information needed in the mining process is presented in the tree structure. Building the tree structure requires only two scans for the database. After building the FPtree, the FP-growth routine mines all the frequent patterns from the tree structure without referring to the original database and without generating candidates Only one itemset can be considered at a time, and a new tree is constructed from the set of itemsets that occur. This tree is called conditional structure; this D T T T X X K K T X X s D X 1 X X X X X c c X Y I D I Y be a subset of items such that be a set of distinct items. Let is to find all the association rules that have support and confidence greater than or equal to the user predefined minimum support and minimum confidence respectively Once the frequent itemset are determined generating the rules is straightforward; so the focus of the paper will be on how to enumerate the frequent itemsets efficiently  The Association rules mining problem over database I i 1 i 2 i n

If this vector previously existed we merely increment its frequency. Otherwise, we simply add it with a support count equal to 1. In other words we partition the database to a set of partitions such that each partition stores the vectors of the same length. In addition, we store the summation of the position values presented in the vector with each vector. This value will be used during the mining procedure using the conditional approach.

We begin by providing an illustrative example followed by a formula description of the algorithm Table 1 shows a database of six transactions. In the first step, the database is scanned to determine the set of frequent 1-itemset. Since the only frequent items can participate in formulating the frequent itemsets, this step aims to eliminate those items that less support than the user\220s predefined minimum support. Assume that the  absolute support count is 2. The set of frequent 1 items are then{\(A,4\\(B,5\,\(C,5\,\(D,4\ The number beside the item refer to its frequency. The next step is to associate  a unique  number with each item using the Rank function. As a result we have: Rank\(A 1, Rank\(B\ 2, Rank\(C\ = 3, Rank\(D\ = 4   X ={x 1 x 2 203..,x k  X X`={x 1 x 2 x k-1  Rank\(x\220 i ank\(x i-1  Rank\(x\220 i  Rank\(x\220 i  Known k+1 k-1 k-1 k-1 X\220 = {x 1 x 2 x\220 i x i+2 x k  Assume Assume 


It is clear that the support count of any itemset is equal to the number of times it occurs as a single transaction plus the number of transactions in which occurs as a subset. The next two subsections discuss how the positional lexicographic tree can be used during the mining process using two different approaches. Top down and conditional V\220 PLT V\(t\220 PLT Structure j = k down to 2 Add V\220 with V\220.Freq = V.Freq L= L-1 D, min_sup k i i t pos Generate frequent 1 items Then for each entry presented in 003 003 003 003 of  the form [p 1 p 2 203.,p k  w it h p s as  p o s itio n al  values, we generate the  vectors of the first two subsets at level k-1  as follows A The first subset is constructed based on lemma 4.1.3.a by removing the last positional value p k  B The second subset is constructed by replacing p k and p k-1 by their sum, lemma 4.1.3.b For reasons of efficiency and correctness, we may include the first step above in the positional tree construction process since we need this step only for the already existed vectors not for those that are generated using part B above. This is done by adding the vector at different levels in the database by considering one position at a time. For instance, vector 1,1,1,1 s h o u ld b e ad d e d as  1 1 1    1  1  a t D 3 and D 2 partitions.  In this case, the top down approach is started by considering part B above and constructing the vector [p 1 p 2 203.,p k-1 p k  n d a d di n g i t t o t h e D k-1 partition. The same thing is done for all the vectors in D k and the vectors in the other partitions by considering the last tow positions. After this, part B from above is repeated, but this time the process occurs by shifting one position to the left \(i.e. the pair \(p k-2 p k1 for level k\. The new vector is [p1,p2,..,p k-1 p k-2 p k  and the same is the case for all other partitions one shift to the left from the pervious location considered any vector that does not  have enough space for shifting has  already gone through the mining process The entire process will continue until there is no longer enough space to shift in any vector.  The same condition should be applied to the vectors that were generated in previous iteration if they can satisfy the shifting \(i.e. consecutive positional can be added\. In this way, all of the subsets are generated and frequency support is inherited by the subsets without duplications  In this methodology, we start with the database partition that represents the itemset of maximum length. For example each V 5. The PLT Mining Process  1    At the end of the above procedure, the database contains all the frequencies of all the subsets that may be presented in the database, and the frequent items are those that have frequency grater than the predefined minimum support. Figure 4 shows the database after the above procedure has been applied to the database in Table 1. We assumed that part A was constructed during the constructions process.

In this paper, a new data structure for mining association rules was proposed. We successfully showed how this structure can be used with the two most popular mining methods, the top down and conditional approaches. Compared to pervious representations of the data, PLT provides a promising structure that is applicable to indexing and compression techniques, which makes PLT a solution when large databases are being mined. In additions PLT is considered to be self-continued structure, which means that there is no need for any other data structure during the mining process. This is different  from pervious methods such as the  Apriori algorithm that required several data structures during the mining process. Another contribution of PLT is the way in which it provides  subset checking which, is considered to be one of the heaviest steps in the mining process , and the way in which it identifies the conditional structure, which is easier in PLT compared to the links  presented in the FP-tree. PLT provides partition criteria that makes it easy to partition the mining process into several separate tasks; each can be accomplished separately. We have also shown how the top down approach does not employ the anti-monotone property, which makes it suitable for situations where a very low minimum support is provided. Or, if it 5.1. The Conditional Approach 6. Conclusion 007 The last subsection showed how the top down approach can be used in the mining process. Although this approach provides an efficient way to propagate the frequency from an itemset to all of its subsets, it does not fully utilize the anti-monotone property: \215all subsets of frequent itemsets should be frequent\216. Later we will discuss the appropriate situation for the top down methodology. Here we will discuss the possibility of having the positional tree cooperate with the pattern growth approach that uses conditional intermediate data structures. In this approach, the anti monotone property can be fully utilized; the contribution of the positional lexicographic tree in this method is the way in which it provides  subset checking between  itemsets In the conditional method, the process begin be considering an \(item / itemset\ at a time and constructing its conditional database [3  T h e  conditional database of an itemset provides a model for  all  of the supersets of the itemset presented in the original database. From this conditional database an extension of the itemset then made from the frequent items presented in its conditional database, and the support count is computed from this database. A new conditional database is constructed as long the produced itemset is frequent. If the new extension is no longer frequent, there is no need for a new conditional database and the mining process ends with this itemset if it is frequent, another extension is considered and the process continues recursively. The contribution of positional lexicographic tree in this approach is in the way in which the conditional tree of the new extended itemset is identified, using lemma 4.1.1, and in the way how the conditional structure presented where we assume it as a new PLT structure and called it conditional PLT For the database in Table 1, starting from the highest ranked item, which is 4 \(i.e. we are in the process of building the conditional database of item D the conditional database for item D is the database that contains vectors with a sum equal to D\220s rank. The support frequency of D is equal to the sum of the frequencies of the vectors that participate in building D\220s conditional database. In order to obtain the correct result, during the process of constructing D\220s database from the original database, for each vector support D a new vector is constructed by removing the last position value and inserting this vector into the proper partition in the original database. Based on this discussion Figure 5 \(a\nd \(b\hows the original database after extracting D\220s conditional structure and D\220s conditional structure itself. The process continues by considering D\220s conditional database and considering extensions for D one by one in reverse lexicographic order and building the conditional database of \(D the new extension\ where the new extension is the highest ranked item presented in D\220s conditional PLT If the new support is frequent, the mining process continues. Otherwise, the mining process ends at this stage. Algorithm 3 provides a formula description for this conditional mining approach using PLT, which is first invoked with an empty set as an itemset and the PLT  F i g u r e  5    a   D  s  c o n d i t i o n a l  d a t a b a s e     b   T h e  P L T

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
