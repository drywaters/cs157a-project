Formal Concept Analysis FCA 
1 Introduction 
In this paper we present the foundations for mining frequent tri-concepts which extend the notion of closed itemsets to three-dimensional data to allow for mining folksonomies We provide a formal de\336nition of the problem and present an ef\336cient algorithm for its solution as well as experimental results on a large real-world example 
13 a mathematical th eory for deriving concept hierarchies from data provides an elegant framework for 
in the data mining community and as 
social resource sharing systems 
in FCA Independent of this development Formal Concept Analysis has been extended about ten years ago to deal with three-dimensional data 8 T hi s l i n e o f

reducing the effort of mining association rules 9 14 12 a new research area emerged around 1999 which became known as 
iceberg concept lattices 
closed itemset mining 
as core data structure of 
folksonomies 
did not receive a broad attention up to now With the rise of 
 however the interest in Triadic Concept Analysis increased again With this paper we initiate the con\037uence of both lines of research Triadic Concept Analysis and closed itemset mining In particular we give a formal de\036nition of the 
the threedimensional version of mining all frequent closed itemsets and present our algorithm T RIAS for mining all frequent triconcepts of a given dataset The paper is organized as follows In the next section we introduce folksonomies and social resource sharing sys 
problem of mining all frequent tri-concepts 
tems and motivate our conceptu al clustering approach for this kind of data In Section 3 we discuss Triadic Formal Concept Analysis and provide in Section 4 a formal de\036nition of the problem of mining frequent triadic formal concepts in Section 5 we introduce our T RIAS algorithm Section 6 comes up with a real-world application the folksonomy of the bookmark sharing system del.icio.us and concludes with experiments on the effectiveness and ef\036ciency of the algorithm 
2 Motivation Conceptual Clustering of Folksonomies 
Social resource sharing systems on the web such as the shared photo gallery Flickr 1  the bookmarking system del.icio.us 2 or our own system BibSonomy 3 see Figure 1 have acquired large numbers of users within less than two years The reason for their immediate success is the fact that no speci\036c skills are needed for participating and that these tools yield immediate b ene\036t for each individual user e.g organizing ones bookmarks in a browser-independent persistent fashion without too much overhead The core data structure of a social resource sharing system is a 
U T R 
of users tags and resources resp and a ternary relation 
between them Folksonomies have thus one dimension more than typical basket analysis datasets which consist of the two dimensions 221items\222 and 221transactions\222 A formal model for Folksonomies as well as an overview of related work can be found in 6 Our algorithm solves the problem of frequent closed itemset mining for this kind of data It will return a tri 
Y 
 It consists of assignments of arbitrary catchwords 226 called 222tags\222 226 to resources by users Thus it consists of three sets

A B C 
of tags and a set 
in the 
ordered set of frequent triples where each triple 
of users a set 
consists of a set 
of resources These triples 226 called frequent

increase of frequent tri-sets in June 2004 while the number of frequent tri-concepts grows at a different level This can be explained when looking further on the size of the tri-concepts found which also grows from month to month since more and more users appear and start agreeing on a common vocabulary Especi ally such large concepts as shown in Figure 2 do not appear until June 2004 but they are responsible for the steep increase of frequent tri-sets Overall one can observe that the number of frequent trisets of every snapshot is always at least one magnitude of size larger than the number of frequent tri-concepts Consequently computing frequent tri-sets is much more demanding than computing frequent tri-concepts 226 without providing any additional information A comparison of the speed improvement gained from not computing all tri-concepts with an algorithm like N EXT C LOSURE and afterwards pruning the non-frequent concepts but using the T RIAS algorithm for directly mining frequent tri-concepts is shown in Figure 4 The logarithmically scaled Y T RIAS time in seconds Ordered Sets algorithm on del.icio.us datasets         References relation One can see that computing all tri-concepts is more than one magnitude more expensive than mining only the frequent tri-concepts one is interested in With the results seen we can conclude that the T RIAS algorithm

S. Construct the residue Rb \(T 9. recursive-FP-growth\(Tb1 b U a Goal of the recursive call: generate all fs. having b U a as suffix We give an overview of the process of constructing a residual FP-tree. In [7, 6, p.242] it is specified that the residual tree be constructed by first constructing the residual database, and then from the residual database constructing the residual tree. Instead, we will construct the residual tree directly Let T be a FP-tree and b an item appearing in T. The residue Rb\(T header for b and following the horizontal links so as to en  counter all the b-nodes in T. At each b-node, travel upward to find and mark all its ancestors. Sometimes \(for example when the minimum support threshold 0" is 1 tree is isomorphic to the set of marked nodes and the copy  ing process is straightforward. Other times, consolidation of paths occurs, because some items in J &lt;b become not fre  quent. An algorithm to construct the residual tree is pre  sented in [9], and is linear in the number of nodes marked in the parent tree, even when consolidation occurs. This lin  earity may fail to hold in the standard FP-growth algorithm because of sorting of items when constructing the residual tree 4.1 Time complexity of the variant of FP-growth Proposition 8 The time complexity of the variant of FP  growth on a database D equals the sum of the following three quantities  size\(D f the number qf items in all records  the sum of the number of nodes in unconsolidated residual FP-trees  the size of the output, i.e. the sum of the number of items in all frequent sets Proof. From the pseudocode above, it is clear that the computational complexity of the execution time is the sum of the three quantities  time to read data file D and construct the original FP  tree. The time to read D is 8\(size\(D  nal FP-tree can be constructed in the same time bound  time to construct all residual FP-trees. By choosing to construct each residual FP-tree directly from its parent FP-tree, the time to construct it is linear in the number of nodes of the parent tree marked during the process of constructing it. If no consolidation occurs, this num  ber equals the number of nodes in the FP-tree being constructed  time to write frequent sets Each of these three quantities is linear in the correspond  ing quantity in the statement of the proposition. D 5 Complexity of the variant of FP-growth on CP\(c,t Let D be the Cartesian product data file CP\(c, t will perform the analysis supposing that the ordering on items is what we call the standard ordering: if items a and b are of attributes i and j respectively and i &lt; j, then a &lt; b Also, throughout this section, the minimum support thresh  old is 1 The number of nodes in the FP-tree for CP \(c, t the number of distinct prefixes occurring the the input file The prefixes of size 1 are precisely the items of attribute 1: each record contains 1 item of attribute 1, and it will be the first item in ct-l records. In general, the prefixes of size j are all j-tuples of items, where the ith coordinate is filled by an item of attribute i \(1 ::; i ::; j number of prefixes occurring in the input file is L?=o cj cHI -1 c - 1 for the file is the same Let T be the FP-tree for CP\(c, t we simplify the notation for the residue of 8: Rs\(T 


we simplify the notation for the residue of 8: Rs\(T be written as R\(8 write R\(b k, the residual FP-tree R\(b for CP\(c, k - 1 encountered in the execution of the variant of FP-growth on CP\(c, t with the standard ordering CP\(c, u Proposition 9 The sum of the sizes of all residues \(exclud  ing the original FP-tree C + 1 cj -1 c1 c + l Proof. Where 8 ? J, a residue R\(8 iff 8 contains at most one item of each attribute \(hence 8 is contained in at least one record 8 = {bl, b2    bj} where bl &lt; b2 &lt; ... bj, and let bl be of attribute k. Then R\( 8 for CP\(c, k - 1 8 ck - 1 c -1 the number of subsets 8' of J such that R\( 8 to R\( 8 c + 1 attribute k is such a 8' and 8' can be constructed by choosing an arbitrary item in attribute k, and for each attribute after k either choosing an item of that attribute or choosing no item of that attribute \(c + 1 alternatives in all residues is L?=l c\(c + l ck -1 c - 1 To establish an upper bound on this quantity: let a j c\( c + 1 cj - 1 c - 1  terested in is L?=l aj. It may be verified that the sequence aI, a2, ... at is a decreasing sequence. Hence L?=l aj &lt tal = tc\(c+ l Proposition 10 The time complexity of the variant of FP  growth on CP\(c, t with 0" = 1, and the standard ordering on items tc\(c + l Proof. The execution time of the algorithm on CP \(c, t with the standard ordering on items is the sum of 3 quanti  ties D  size\(V namely tct  the sum of the sizes of all FP-trees generated \(namely the \(ct+1 - 1 c - 1 plus at most tc\(c + l  the sum of the number of items in all frequent sets namely tc\(c + l 6 Complexity of the variant of FP-growth on  P\(n,:::; t In this section we establish the computational complex  ity of the variant of FP-growth on the limited power set data file. In this section, the minimum support threshold 0" is 1. Results of this section then provide an upper bound on the time complexity with higher support thresholds.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and benet the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R  A gra w al and R  S r i kant   Fast Al gori t h ms for M i n i n g A ssociation Rules Proc of the 20th VLDB Conf  1994 pp 487499  R Agra w a l and J C S hafer  Paral l e l M i n i n g o f A ssoci at i o n Rules IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8 No 6 1996 pp 962969 3 M  S  C hen J Han and P  S  Y u   Dat a Mi ni ng An Overview from a Database Perspective IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8 No 6 1996 pp 866883 4 D  W  C heung S  D L ee and Y  Xi ao  E f f ect of Dat a S k e w ness and Workload Balance in Parallel Data Mining IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 14 No 3 2002 pp 498514 5 S  M  C hung and J Y ang  A Par al l e l D i s t r i b ut i v e J oi n A l gorithm for Cube-Connected Multiprocessors IEEE Trans on Parallel and Distributed Systems  Vol 7 No 2 1996 pp 127137  R  F e l dman and H Hi rsh F i ndi ng Associ at i ons i n Col l ections of Text Machine Learning and Data Mining Methods and Applications  R Michalski I Bratko and M Kubat editors John Wiley and Sons 1998 pp 223240  R F e l dman I Dagen and H  H i rsh Mi ni ng T e xt Usi n g Keyword Distributions Journal of Intelligent Information Systems  Vol 10 No 3 1998 pp 281300  C  Fox L e x i cal Anal ysi s and S t opl i s t s   Inforamtion Retrieval Data Structures and Algorithms W.FrakesandR Baeza-Yates editors Prentice Hall 1992 pp 102130 9 M  G or don and S  Dumai s Usi ng L a t e nt S e mant i c I nde xi ng for Literature Based Discovery Journal of the Amer Soc of Info Science  Vol 49 No 8 1998 pp 674685  J Han J P e i  and Y  Y i n Mi n i n g F r equent Pat t e r n s w i t hout Candidate Generation Proc of ACM SIGMOD Intl Conf on Management of Data  2000 pp 112  J D Holt and S  M Chung Multipass Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Text Databases Knowledge and Information Systems  Vol 3 No 2 Springer-Verlag 2001 pp 168183  J D Hol t and S  M C hung Mi ni ng Associ at i o n R ul es Using Inverted Hashing and Pruning Information Processing Letters  Vol 83 No 4 Elsevier Science 2002 pp 211220  J D Hol t and S  M C hung Mi ni ng associ at i o n R ul es i n Text Databases Using Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning Proc of the 14th IEEE Intl Conf on Tools with Articial Intelligence  2002 pp 4956  J S  Park M S  C hen and P  S  Y u   Usi n g a Hash-B a sed Method with Transaction Trimming for Mining Association Rules IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 9 No 5 1997 pp 813825  G  S a l t on Automatic Text Processing The Transformation Analysis and Retrieval of Information by Computer  Addison-Wesley Publishing 1988  E  M V oorhees and D K Harmon edi t o rs The Fifth Text Retrieval Conference  National Institute of Standards and Technology 1997  O R  Z a i a ne and M L  Ant o i ne C l assi f y i n g T e x t D ocuments by Associating Terms with Text Categories Proc of the 13th Australian Database Conf  2002 0-7695-2132-0/04/$17.00 \(C Proceedings of the 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium \(IPDPS04 


  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
