Improving Intrusion Detection Performance Using Rough Set Theory and Association Rule Mining   Wang Xuren Information Engineering College of Capital Normal University, Beijing, 100037, China wangxr@mail.ihep.ac.cn He Famei Chengdu Institute of Computer Application Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China hefm@mail.ihep.ac.cn   Abstract  Intrusion Detection System has some defects, such 
as signatures being generated manually, updating attack signatures difficultly and doing nothing in front of ultra data set. This paper presents a hybrid approaches for modeling IDS. Association rule mining and Rough set theory are combined as a hierarchical hybrid intelligent system model. The hybrid intrusion detection model combines association rule mining and rough set theory to improve detection accuracy and reduce false alarm, unreal alarm and computational complexity. Empirical results illustrate that the hybrid 
intrusion detection model can detect intrusion more accurately  1. Introduction  This paper deals with intrusion detection and the related issue of giving a good detection system Intrusion detection \(ID\ is a type of security management system for computers and networks. An intrusion detection system \(IDS\ inspects all inbound and outbound network activity and identifies suspicious patterns that may indicate a network or system detects 
attack from someone attempting to break into or compromise a system Several machine-learning paradigms including neural networks, linear genetic programming, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, multivariate adaptive regression splines, fuzzy inference systems rough set theory, etc. have been applied to the design of IDS  M a n y da t a  m i ni n g  t e c hn i que s  i n c l u di n g  discovering association rules, have been applied to 
intrusion detection [2  D is c o v e r i n g as s o c iatio n  r u le s  was introduced in [3   Th es e a p p r o a c h es b u i l d  detection models by applying data-mining algorithms to large data sets of audit data. But sometimes, many unuseful rules are produced In this paper we investigate and evaluate the performance of association rule discovering, rough set theory and a hybrid system. The reason for using the hybrid approach is to improve the accuracy of the 
intrusion detection system when compared to using individual approaches. The hybrid approach combines the best results from the individual systems resulting in more accuracy In this paper, we will concentrate on using the ensemble of rough set theory and association rule discovering to achieve better classification accuracies The data we used in our experiments is KDD CUP 99 data sets  I t w a s de v e l o pe d fo r ID S e v a l u a t i o n s by  
DARPA. We performed experiments to classify each of the five classes of patterns in the data. It is shown that using the hybrid system for classification gives good accuracies In the rest of the paper, a brief introduction to related work in the field of intrusion detection is given in Section 2. A brief introduction to the data we used is given in Section 3. In Section 4 the theoretical aspects of rough set theory, association rule discovery and a 
hybrid system are described. In Section 5 the experimental results of the hybrid system are presented In Section 6, we conclude our results  2. Intrusion Detection  There are basically two main types of IDS being 


001 A determines an indiscernibility relation as follows R B  x  y  U 327 U  a  x  a  y  used today: Network based and Host based. Network Intrusion Detection System \(NIDS\ analyzes individual packets flowing through a network. The malicious packets that may be overlooked by a firewall simplistic filtering rules can be detected in the NIDS. While in a host-based system, the IDS examines the activity of each individual computer or host Intrusion detection technology has two main categories: anomaly detection and misuse detection Misuse detection is the most common approach to intrusion detection, which detects previously seen known attacks by looking for attack signatures in attack database. The main disadvantage of misuse detection is that new attacks cannot be predicted or detected without coding them into the IDS attack database and has high false-alarm rate. In fact, these systems need to be updated frequently to detect new attacks as soon as they are discovered Anomaly detection is based on the assumption that misuse or intrusive behavior deviates from normal system use[5  T h e  ma i n ad v a n t ag e o f an o m aly  detection is that it can detect new attacks A review of the many alternative approaches to intrusion detection is available in [6    3. Intrusion data set  The KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection contest data i s us e d i n o ur e xpe ri m e n t s  T h e  1998 D A R P A  Intrusion Detection Evaluation program by MIT Lincoln Labs prepared this data. Lincoln labs acquired nine weeks of raw TCP dump data.  The raw data was processed into 24 attack types. These attacks belong to four main categories: probing, denial of service \(DoS user to root attacks \(U2R\ and remote to user attacks R2U For each TCP/IP connection, 41 various quantitative and qualitative features plus one class label were extracted in the data set. Each record includes 9 basic Features, 13 Content Features, 9 Time-based features and 10 Host-based features. Basic Features were basic features to every network connection like duration of connection, service requested, and bytes transferred between source and destination machine etc. Content Features were like logged in flag, number of failed logins, hot indicators, etc. Time-based features were collected by observing various connections in \223twosecond\224 time window with respect to current connection, such as SYN error rates, Rejection rates number of different services requested etc. Host-based features were collected that were based on the past 100 connections similar to the one under consideration Experiments have two phases, namely, training phase and testing phase. In the training phase the system builds a model using the training data to give maximum generalization accuracy \(accuracy on unseen data\. To find out the intrusion in the testing phase, the constructed model detects the test data. Besides the four different types of attacks mentioned above we also have to detect the normal class. Training data set in the paper contained 49,402 records, which were randomly generated from the KDD Cup 1999 10% training data set. Test data use 10% of test data sets of the KDD Cup 1999 data sets. Table 1 gives the distribution of data categories in the training and test data 002 a B  R B partitions U into a family of disjoint subsets U  R B  called a partition of U   U  R B  x  B  x U  where x  B denotes the equivalence class determined by x with respect to \(w.r.t B i.e  x  B  y U  x  y  R B  Data distribution in training data and test data Training data Test data Type Count Percent Count Percent Normal 9768 19.77% 60592 19.48 Probing 435 0.88% 4166 1.34 DoS 39085 79.11% 231453 74.42 U2R 3 0.01% 79 0.03 R2L 111 0.22% 14740 4.74  4. Hybrid system for Intrusion Detection  4.1. Rough set theory   Rough sets have been introduced as a tool to deal with inexact, uncertain or vague knowledge in many branches of artificial intelligence. The investigation of the rough set methodology for data mining is a challenging research area Information system is defined as S  U  A  d  V  f where U is a non-empty, finite set of objects called the universe V is a set of values of attributes in A such that f  U V a for any a A where V a is called the domain of a and d includes decision attributes. The information system is also called a decision table Each non-empty subset B 1  Table 


The Hybrid Intelligent System with Rough Set Theory and Association Rule Discovery Given a set \(or concept X 1    4.3.1. Reduction by rough set theory In the database there are 31 quantitative attributes of 41 attributes which result in large amount of data and high data dimensionality. The processing of ultra large data set is a novel area for the rough set methodology. One of the plausible approaches to tackle ultra large data is to reduce the data set horizontally, which means that a set of continuous values is partitioned into a finite number of intervals \(categories\. And this is common to the rough set community. The data-preprocessing unit discretizes the numerical attributes by an automatic discretization algorithm, Semi-naive algorithm[11   Semi-naive algorithm has more logic to handle the case where value-neighboring objects belong to different decision classes For example, in our experiments the cuts of attribute Duration after discretization are 0.5, 57, 62, 65, 72.5, 328.5, 337.5, 5007, 5064 5065.5, 5195, 10017.5, 10228, 12503, 12553.5 13901.5, 14191.5, 21204.5, 22625, 28847.5  4.3.2. Rule generation by discovering association rule In the application of association rule mining sometimes mined rules are not useful, especially in mining classification rules, i.e Service Http  Port 80 Even if the confidence of the rule were 100%, such rules are meaningless and lead to the number of detection rules becoming larger, which will lower detection efficiencies and effect detection accuracy Figure 003  The lower approximation  R B  X is the set of objects that belong to X with certainty, while the upper approximation  R B  X is the set of objects that possibly belong to X The pair  R B  X   R B  X is referred to as the Pawlak rough set of X w.r.t B   4.2. Association rule mining   Association rule discovery, the area being studied most actively[3  8   9   1 0  is  a te c h n i q u e to i n v e s tig a t e  the possibility of simultaneous occurrence of the data Let I  i 1  i 2  i m be a set of literals, called items Let D be a set of transactions, where each transaction T  is a set of items such that T 001 U and an equivalence relationship R B 001 A one can define X 222s lower and upper approximations Lower Approximation  R B  X  x  x U  x  B 001 X  Upper Approximation  R B  X  x  x U  x  B X 001 I An association rule is an implication of the form X Y where X I  Y I  X Y  003  Support and confidence are used to describe the \223interestingness\224 or \223goodness\224 of a rule as follows support  X Y  P  X Y  confidence  X Y  P  Y  X  or confidence  X Y  support  X Y  P  x  The support of the rule X Y is the proportion of transactions in D that contain X Y The confidence of the association rule X Y is the proportion of transactions including both X and Y to all the transactions that include X The existing association rule discovery techniques have discovered the association that may happen only among the data that satisfy the minimum support and minimum confidence set by the users. All item sets that have support greater than or equal to the user specified minimum support are generated That is, generating all frequent item sets according to minimum support value. Then generate all the rules that have minimum confidence in the following naive way: For a frequent item set B and any X 004 B let Y  B X If the rule X Y satisfies the minimum confidence, it is a valid rule   4.3. Hybrid rough set-association rule mining system   A hybrid intelligent system integrates different learning techniques. Different learning models produce better performance than the individual learning approaches by reducing their individual limitations and making using of their advantages.

003 037 s Restricting right-hand-side of association rules to the classification attribute can solve the problem. In this paper association rule mining is redefined under rough set theory frame as follows given a information system S  U  A  d  V  f as defined in rough set theory X Y is called a association rule where X 037 i   a i  v i  a i 037 A v i  f  a i nd Y 037 d  The rule measurements of support and confidence are defined the same as before Figure 2 is the algorithm of classification rule mining by association rule discovery based on rough set theory.

So the rule 2 will be deleted from rule sets  Besides the measurements of the support and confidence of association rules, we need a measure of dependent or correlated events, which is called Interest   correlation  lift of a association rule defined as lift     P     P   P  037   P   P   According to the value of lift    we can do some rule pruning as follows  and  are independent events, if lift    1 or P  037   P   P  the rule will be pruned from the rule sets If the value of lift    is less than 1  and  are negatively correlated. Even if the support or confidence of the rule were high, the rule would mislead the detection. So such rule will be pruned too Otherwise  and  are positively correlated; it means the occurrence of  implies the occurrence of  The rule should be reserved in the rule sets  5. Experiments  5.1. Experiments using rough set theory   The same data set described in Section 3 is being used to test the performance of rough set theory. The Information system is first discretized by semi Naive algorithm, and then we use genetic algorithm  doing attribute reduction. Finally the decision table is obtained and classification rule can be extracted from the decision table. Table 2 gives the detection accuracy of experiments using rough set classification rules. In Table 2, 99.0% of the actual \221normal\222 data and 94.0 of the actual \221DoS\222 data are detected correctly. But the data of the rest classes are detected not well   The algorithm of classification rule mining by association rule discovery  4.3.3. Rule selection When we apply the algorithm in Figure 2, we get complete set of association rules that satisfy the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence conditions. In order to improve the detection efficiency, doing some rule selection as follows can reduce the number of the rules.If  1 and  2 are two rules with the same precedence, but the conclusions are not the same, then the rule with lower confidence will be discarded. This can avoid repeated and inconsistent rules If 1  and 2 have the  same  conclusions but different precedence, and at the same time there exits 1

R2L\222s cases are little better than \221U2R\222 data\222s but not optimistic yet The reason maybe is that there are too few U2R data and R2L data, which are 3 and 111 connections, or 0.01% and 0.22% respectively in training data, to produce good enough detection rules Table 4 gives overall accuracy of the classification and rule count of each test.

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than ìbest î in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a ìbest ?rstî case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
