The proposed method improves generalization abilities of an ensemble with additional reduction of its complexity. It is dedicated to committees of decision trees and bases on transformation of a set of trees into a set of rules with a new, well-suited, weighed voting algorithm. The 
paper also presents experiments showing the properties and effectiveness of proposed method and direction of further research   1. Introduction  One of the most studied tasks in data mining is the classification task. Its aim is to run a learning algorithm on a set of training examples, to produce a classifier. The classifier is a data model, which, when given a new example, predicts the corresponding class label. Classifiers enable automated data labelling and can be applied to a variety of problems ranging from strictly scientific to practical The information needed to design a classifier is 
usually given in the form of labelled data D  t 1  t 2  t N where t i  x  c  
001  X  
327  C is a data vector x  x 1  x 2  x m associated with a class label c from a discrete set of classes C  X i  is the domain of 
327 X 2 327  
327 X m is the domain of the data vector Components of the vector x are usually continuous or discrete \(nominal\ values, such as height, weight, age eye colour and so on. These components of the data vector are often referred to as the features or attributes of an example. A classifier is, for a given data set, a hypothesis about the approximated function F  X 
x i and X  X 1 002 
 C  Examples of simple classifiers include: linear and quadratic discriminants, the k-nearest neighbour rule Parzen density classifiers, decision trees and neural networks, but one of the major advances in inductive learning in the past  15 years was the development of ensemble approaches [1  C l a s s i f i e r s co m b i n in g  methods have become popular because of the fact, that although for many data sets it\222s easy to find a hypothesis which exactly classifies the training set, it is uncommon to find a single expert achieving the best 
results for the overall problem domain. Experimental results showed that ensemble methods can significantly increase prediction abilities of the whole system. The need for a general theory that would underpin classifier combination has been acknowledged regularly, but such a theory does not yet exist [2  P le n ty  o f me th o d s  have been developed for the construction of ensembles but they have to respect the assumption that base classifiers in an ensemble should be different from each other \226 otherwise there is no gain in combining them. The base classifiers can be of any type 
mentioned above; different data subsets and different feature subsets can be used to build base classifiers and finally different methods can be used by the classifier ensemble to make its decisions Nevertheless, there are also some drawbacks. In general, ensemble classifiers have an internal representation that cannot be easily viewed or parsed This can discredit the ensemble in some application areas, where justification or presentation of the decisionmaking process is essential, such as medical diagnostic systems. Furthermore, complex classifiers 
demand more storage resources and require more time to make a decision  2. Reduction of an ensemble to a set of rules  The proposed method aims to improve generalization abilities of an ensemble with additional reduction of its\222 complexity. It is designed for ensemble classifiers, which are made up of classification trees as base classifiers. Decision trees offer some advantages, because they can handle both continuous and nominal data, generate interpretable 


classification rules, are fast to train and are often as accurate as, or even slightly more accurate than many other base classifiers. In the proposed approach a simple tree is treated as a set of Horn rules, making it possible to transform a set of classification trees into a single rule set. During the transformation process duplicate rules are removed, which is equivalent to the elimination of covering parts of trees. In the case of an ensemble this can be profitable, because one of the main issues involved in designing an ensemble classifier is to increase the diversity of simple classifiers [3  R e d u c tio n to a  r u le s e t e n ab le s  modification of the decisionmaking method of an ensemble, by giving voting rights to those rules, for which more than a given percentage of conditions pc  for a particular data vector is satisfied. The weight of a vote of individual rules depends on the percentage of satisfied conditions, but what is more, rules with less than 100% of satisfied conditions have their vote\222s weights additionally reduced. This reduction depends on a parametrically given factor wr This operation is equivalent to decision trees pruning and what is more it enables involving additional information in the classification process. It can be additionally noticed that during the transformation process two rules are considered identical when both premises and the conclusion are the same. In effect the rule set can contain conflicting rules \(the same premises and different conclusions\. It is a consequence of that the ensemble of trees can consists of trees that can yield different conclusions for a given data vector. For completeness\222 sake, a detailed description of the training and classification algorithm involved in the proposed method is provided in Figure 1 To evaluate the proposed method a variety of experiments were performed. The first step was to build an ensemble of classification trees. As a learner of base classifiers, the C4.5 algorithm was used \226 this is one of the best available algorithms for generating classification trees [4  A d d i ti o n al l y  b a g g in g w a s u s ed  as a method for generating diverse ensembles. Breiman introduced the term bagging as an acronym for Bootstrap AGGregatING  T h e i de a o f b a ggi n g i s  simple and appealing: the diversity necessary to make the ensemble work is created using different training sets - each classifier is trained on a set of N training examples, drawn randomly by replacement of the original training set of size N. Such a training set is called a bootstrap replicate of the original set. Bagging was compared by Banfield [6  ag a i n s t 7 mo s t p o p u la r  tree ensemble creation techniques, and none of the methods he considered appeared significantly more accurate than bagging from a statistical viewpoint  3. Experimental results  Experiments were performed on 10 publicly available data sets form UCI Machine Learning Repository [7  F i r s tly e x p e r i me n t s w e r e co n d u c te d to  establish individually for each data set an optimal number of classification trees in an ensemble Secondly, during ten independent 10-fold cross validations \(divisions of data set for training and testing data sets in proportion 9:1\ the following steps were sequentially 100 times performed 1  Building the ensemble 2  Evaluating the classification error of ensemble on training and test data set 3  Transforming the ensemble into a set of rules and counting the percentage reduction in the number of rules  Input data 1  C={ c 1  cj   set of class labels 2  data set D  t 1  t 2  t N where t i  x  c  c 003 the ensemble of classification trees 4  RE  003 the ensemble of classification trees reduced to a rule set  Training algorithm 1  Train the ensemble of trees E  2  For each tree T  001  C  3  E  001  E do  Turn T into a rule set R T    For each rule r  001  R T  do  If r  004  RE then add r to RE  3.

4  Evaluating the classification error of the set of rules, on training and testing datasets, for 6 different values of the wr parameter \(from 50 to 100\nd  20 different values of the pc parameter from 0.05 to 1  The classification error was counted as a percentage of vectors from data set for which the classifier gives a wrong answer. The obtained results were averaged and are presented in Table 1. At first glance it can be noticed that the ensemble of decision trees indeed outperforms the single tree generated with the C4.5 algorithm \(and other simple classifiers such as ID3 MLP, see e.g. [8  H ow e v e r  s ub s e que n t  transformation of the ensemble into a rule set for most of the considered data sets can additionally reduce the obtained classification error.

The size of error reduction differs for individual data sets, which is quite expected. The largest value \226 12.23% \(over 40% of ensemble error\an be observed for the balance data set. Only two of the considered data sets did not see any additional error reduction monk3 and iris It can be noticed that for these sets there was also almost no difference between the error obtained with a single decision tree generated by the C4.5 algorithm and an ensemble. Additionally analyzing of performance of ensemble and rule set classifiers on both training and testing data, presented in table 2, it can be seen that if transformation of an ensemble into a rule set reduces classification error for training data, then the error is also reduced for testing data Results achieved by the constructed rule set depend on values of voting parameters pc and wr but it should be noted that for pc 100% \(when only rules with all conditions satisfied are considered during voting\, vote weight for other rules wr has no influence on results It is important to find a method for choosing \(for a given data set\ proper values of voting parameters. One possible method for determining pc and wr can be the performance of transformation method for training data. As an example, Table 3 presents the rule set classification error for testing data with voting parameters values pc and wr for which the training data error was minimal. It can be seen that using the proposed selection of voting parameter values is not optimal, due to an increase in the rule set classification error for testing data in table 3, in relation to results for the best voting parameters values included in table 1 Regardless, the method still ensures significant classification error reduction, both for training and testing data, for a majority of the considered test problems. The only exception is the sonar problem, for which the described wr and pc selection techniques cause a slight classification error increase in comparison to general error reduction \(presented in Table 1\ This shows that, while the proposed transformation of an ensemble of trees into a rule set allows for building classifiers with very good classification properties, there is a need for further search for even better methods of voting parameters selection Finally, one more aspect can be considered. An interesting issue is, how many rules are removed during transformation of an ensemble into a rule set and how this is correlated with error reduction. Table 4 presents averaged results obtained during the described experiments. The size of error reduction is expressed as a percentage change of classifier error following the transformation of the ensemble into a set of rules.  This is compared with the percentage of rules, which are found to be identical to other existing rules and eliminated. By analyzing the table, some simple correlations can be observed. As can be noticed, the worst results were obtained for data sets for which rule reduction was very large: 74,2% removed rules for iris  and 86,08% for the monk3 data set. This means that, in Table 3.

the case of these data sets, despite the application of the bagging algorithm to generate diverse base classifiers, trees generated with C4.5 are very similar to one another. This, in turn, results in lack of significant improvement of ensemble performance over a single decision tree for these data sets. However, the most significant error reduction can be observed for problems for which the percentage of rule number reduction varies between 34 and 66%. For those data sets for which only 25% \(or less\ rules were removed error reduction is also noticeable but not quite as significant  4. Conclusions  The presented results show that proposed method of building and using rule sets as classifiers allows improving classification rules even with respect to ensembles of trees. The new, proposed rule set voting paradigm, which makes use of information hidden in Horn rules only partially satisfied for given data pieces is an extension of  M of N rules \(the influence of partially satisfied rules on voting result is proportional to the percentage of their satisfied conditions Additionally, this method is specially suited for reduction of ensembles of decision trees. Tests performed on training data enable us to determine the values of parameters of the proposed voting algorithm as well as predict error reduction size for test data although additional research in this field is still needed Further statistical analysis of the method for different data sets as well as analysis of obtained rules is also required, but the experiments conducted so far are promising and show the main benefit: a rule set classifier is achieving better classification results than ensembles of decision trees and is easier to process in order to interpret or understand \(by human\ knowledge hidden in the classifier  5.

by logically reorganizing related sentences together no matter how far away these sentences are from each other For instance according to the words direction dened by predicate dictionary and lexines attributes dened by EL the generic rules reasonably connects sentences which have the same subject and direction 4 free from decision rules The decision rules are the pivot component for both statistical and fuzzy approaches However the decision rules are difcult to discover for statistical approaches and require a great deal of domain knowledge for fuzzy approaches In this paper we solve such issue by simply dening 5 generic rules and the experiment shows they are satisfactory What is more important is that they are less domain dependent On the other hand the proposed approach is still domain dependent in some sense Indeed for each domain we have to re-dene EL concepts and semantic patterns In practice it is preferable to constrain the technique to a narrowly dened domain and make use of a large text corpus VI C ONCLUSION In this paper a fundamental research on how to formalize human knowledge through three sets of knowledge is thoroughly discussed The proposed work can either tackle issues challenging the traditional statistical approaches such as how to overcome the insufcient co-occurrence information caused by the limited window size or strengthen machines the capability to impart human knowledge into statistical approaches Based on this research the experiment is also presented to demonstrate the potential capabilities in tackling issues existing in traditional statistical measures and classic fuzzy approaches The results presented indicate that the use of proposed approach enhances the obtained words semantic coefcients Although the proposed approach decreases the domain experts impact on the nal results it is still necessary to apply domain knowledge to help the approach more accurately depict the semantic relations between concepts and words In order to make the approach compatible to multi-domain in future research work we will focus on expanding the unique topic domain to more complex ones Besides we will explore how to construct

Scalability with the transaction number of DB 5. Conclusions In the real world, databases are periodically and continually updated.  Therefore, mining must be repeated Valid patterns and rules must to be efficiently generated Incremental mining must usually involve the original database and the new added transactions.  Scanning the original database is very expensive, so the proposed method outperforms others by avoiding the rescanning of the original database This investigation has presented a new method, NFUP for incremental mining.  NFUP does not require the rescanning of the original database and can determine new frequent itemsets at the latest time intervals.  The proposed method uses information available from a following partition to avoid the rescanning of the original database; it requires only the incremental database to be scanned.  In reality, the transaction number of the incremental database is very small in contrast to the original database.  The running time of NFUP rises almost in direct proportion with the transaction number of the incremental database Accordingly, NFUP is suited frequently updated databases In the future, the authors will consider the extension of the NFUP algorithm to sequence rules References  R.

CBA and Neural Networks at 1% confidence level while they are all significantly better than C4.5 decision tree. Taking the interpretability of classification model into account, these two adapted CBA algorithm seem to be appropriate choices for credit scoring because they generated much more compact decision lists \(less sequential rules original CBA. They therefore favour the well-known Occam  s Razor theory and are more suitable for decision makers to understand. A deeper insight into the rules structures shows that original CBA and adapted CBA 1 both focus on generating classification rules that predict good clients \(with bad clients as the default class implication, numerous rules with high confidence but low support have lower ranks than they are in original CBA. These rules are finally discarded since they are not fired by any training samples, which are matched by these rules with higher intensity of implications thus making the decision lists generated by adapted CBA 1 more compact. Adapted CBA 2 mainly mines these classification rules for bad clients \(with good clients as the default class compact rule sets Original CBA Adapted CBA1 Adapted CBA2 C45 NN dataset accuracy no. of rules accuracy num. of rules accuracy no. of rules accuracy accuracy 1 Austr 85.65% 130.5 86.52% 26.4 86.96% 12.4 86.52% 85.07 2 Germ 73.30% 134 74.40% 56.5 73.20% 19.7 72.40% 74.90 3 Bene 72.92% 393 72.30% 186 73.51% 51 70.21% 72.63 Table 2.

Conclusion Intensity of implication is proposed in the beginning as an interestingness measure for association rules Another novel interestingness measure called dilated chi-square is designed by us to reveal the statistical interdependence between the antecedents and consequents of association rules We then adapt CBA algorithm, which can be used to build classifiers based on class association rules, by coupling it with intensity of implication and dilated chi-square respectively. More concretely, Intensity of implication \(or dilated chi-square primary criterion to rank class association rules at the first step of the database coverage pruning procedure in CBA algorithm. Experiments on three credit scoring datasets proved that these two adapted algorithms compared with original CBA, classical C4.5 decision tree and neural network, achieve satisfactory performance and generates classifiers much more compact than CBA 6.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
