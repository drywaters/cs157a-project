It is a big challenge to apply data mining techniques for effective Web information gathering because of duplications and ambiguities of data values e.g., terms\. To provide an effective solution to this challenge, this paper first explains the relationship between association rules and rough set based decision rules. It proves that a decision pattern is a kind of closed pattern.   It also presents a novel concept of rough association rules in order to improve the effectiveness of association rule mining. The 
premise of a rough association rule consists of a set of terms and a frequency distribution of terms. The distinct advantage of rough association rules is that they contain more specific information than normal association rules. It is also feasible to update rough association rules dynamically to produce effective results   1. Introduction  Web information gathering \(WIG\ystems endeavour to obtain interesting and useful information 
from the Web to meet their user information needs One of the fundamental issues regarding the effectiveness of WIG is \223overload\224 [10 e p ro b lem  of information overload occurs when a large number of irrelevant Web information are considered to be what users want The difficulty for solving the fundamental issue is how to efficiently acquiring knowledge about user information needs. It is easier for users to answer which of Web pages or documents are relevant to a specified topic rather than describe what the specified 
topic they want. Therefore, the research issue is the discovery of useful knowledge in user feedback - a training set of text documents Data mining has been used in Web text mining which refers to the pro cess of searching through unstructured data on the Web and deriving meaning from it   On e of m ain p ur p os e s  o f tex t m in ing i s  association discovery [2 Th e ex isti n g ap p ro aches ar e maximal patterns [7 u en ti al p att er ns 1 8   an d  closed patterns [19  Typically, the existing data mining techniques can 
return numerous discovered pa tterns \(knowledge\from a training set. However, it is a big challenge to use the discovered knowledge efficiently for making decisions due to the noise in the discovered patterns. The concept of closed patterns is forward one more step for dealing with the noise, but there are still many meaningless patterns retained [19  1 8 A not he r approach for improving the quality of association rule mining is to generate only those patterns that are interesting to users based on some constraints [21 
2 Rough set based decision tables pr ovi de a n alternative representation of discovered knowledge Different from the association rule mining, decision tables do not attempt to represent all of interesting patterns. They use constraint-based decision rules that isolate premises and conclusions of rules initially. In terms of association mining, however, there is a puzzle for decision tables, that is, we do not understand what nature of patterns is represented in the decision tables 
In this research, we present the concept of decision patterns to interpret this puzzle The association discovery approaches only discuss relationship between terms in a broad-spectrum level They pay no attention to the duplications of terms, and the labeled information in the training set. The consequential result is that the effectiveness of the 


systems is worse than the traditional information retrieval. Another objective of this paper is to improve the effectiveness of association discovery by presenting the concept of rough association rules where the premise \(precondition\f a rough association rule consists of both a set of terms and a frequency distribution of terms The remainder of the paper is structured as follows We begin by introducing the concept of association mining in Section 2. In section 3, we present the concept of decision patterns to interpret decision tables in terms of association mining. In Section 4, we present the concept of rough association rules. We also introduce a method for updating rough association rules.  Section 6 evaluates the proposed approach for information gathering. Section 7 discusses related work and the last section contains the conclusions  2. Associations in Information Tables  Formally, the association discovery from text documents can be described as an information table  D  V D ere D is a set of documents in which each document is a set of terms  notice: the duplicate terms are removed here\; and V D   t 1  t 2 205 t n is a set of selected terms for all documents in D Usually D  consists of a set of positive documents D  and a set of negative documents D   Definition 1 A set of terms X is referred to as a termset if X  V D Let X be a termset, we use  X  to denote the covering set of X which includes all positive documents d such that X   d i.e  X   d  d  D   X   d  Given a termset X its occurrence frequency is the number of documents that contain the termset that is   X  and its support is  X   D  A termset X is called frequent pattern if its support  min _ sup a minimum support  Table 1 An information table Documents Terms Positive d 1 t 1 t 2   yes  d 2 t 3 t 4  t 6   yes  d 3 t 3 t 4  t 5 t 6   yes  d 4 t 3 t 4  t 5 t 6   yes  d 5 t 1 t 2  t 6 t 7  yes  d 6 t 1 t 2  t 6 t 7  yes  d 7 t 1 t 2   no  d 8 t 3 t 4   no   The confidence of a frequent pattern is the fraction of the documents including the pattern that are positive. Given a frequent pattern X its confidence is defined as  X   N  where  N  d  d D  X   d The confidence shows the percentage of the pattern\222s occurrence frequency in the positive documents. A frequent pattern is called an interesting pattern if its confidence is great than D   D  Table 1 lists a part of an information table, where V D   t 1  t 2 205 t 7  D = D  D  D   d 1 d 2 ,\205 d 6} and D   d 7 d 8}. Let min _ sup 50%, we can obtain the following 10 interesting patterns  Interesting Pattern Covering Set t 3 t 4 t 6    d 2 d 3 d 4 t 3 t 4    d 2 d 3 d 4 t 3 t 6    d 2 d 3 d 4 t 4 t 6    d 2 d 3 d 4 t 3    d 2 d 3 d 4 t 4    d 2 d 3 d 4 t 1 t 2    d 1 d 5 d 6 t 1    d 1 d 5 d 6 t 2    d 1 d 5 d 6 t 6    d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 d 6  Not all interesting patterns are meaningful. For example, pattern t 3  t 4 is a noise pattern since it always occurs with larger pattern t 3 t 4 t 6   Definition 2. G iven a set of positive documents Y we define its termset which satisfies termset  Y    t | t V D  d Y  t d   Given an interesting pattern X we know its covering set  X  which is a subset of positive documents. We also define its closure  C  X  termset   X  From the above definitions, we have the following theorem about the closure operation  Theorem 1 Let X and Y be frequent patterns. We have 1  C  X   X for all patterns X  2  X  Y  C  X   C  Y     Proof 1\For any t  X  t  d for all d    X  since X   d Also, from Definition 2 we hav e t termset   X  at is X   C  X  2\r any t  C  X at is t d for all d    X  For any d\222    Y  we know Y  d\222 and d\222 is a positive document based on Definition 1. From X  Y we have  X  d\222 and hence d\222   X  Therefore t d\222 and t  C  Y    Definition 3 Let X be a pattern X is closed if and only if X  C  X   


 For example, there are only three closed patterns in Table 1 t 3 t 4 t 6  t 1 t 2 and t 6  We can assume that each closed pattern is actually an association rule, e.g t 1 t 2 means \223 t 1 t 2    POS  yes 224. This assumption satisfies the definition about traditional association rules in data mining  3. Decision Patterns  The training set D can also be characterized by a decision table. Table 2 shows a decision table which describes the binary representations of 1000 documents, where N g is the number of documents that are in the same granule; terms t 1  t 2 205 t 7  are called condition attributes and Positive is called decision attribute  Compare to Table 1, a granule in Table 2 not only describes a feature of a document, it also shows the number of documents that have the same feature  Table 2 A binary decision table  Granule t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 Positive N g g 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 yes 80 g 2  0 0 1 1 0 1 0 yes 140 g 3  0 0 1 1 1 1 0 yes 490 g 4  1 1 0 0 0 1 1 yes 220 g 5 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 no 20 g 6 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 no 50  Decision tables provide an alternative way to represent discovered knowledge in database. For example, each granule in Table 2 can be mapped into a decision rule: either a positive decision rule \(the conclusion is \223 yes 224\r a negative decision rule \(the conclusion is \223 no 224 Formally, each granule g determines a sequence t 1  g  t 7  g  Positive  g The sequence can determine a decision rule t 1  g  t 7  g   Positive  g  Its strength is defined as N g  D and its certainty factor is defined as N g  K where K     gtgtVtg g i i i N D  For example g 1 in Table 2 can be read as the following positive rule t 1  t 2   yes Its strength is 8% and certainty factor is 0.8 Different with the association rule mining, decision tables do not tend to represent all of interesting patterns, instead of; they only keep some sorts of larger patterns. In terms of association mining, however, the puzzle for decision tables is that we do not understand what kinds of interesting patterns used in the decision tables. In the following, we present the concept of decision patterns to interpret this puzzle Let X be an interesting pattern. We call it a decision  pattern if d   D  such that X  d   Theorem 2 Decision patterns are closed patterns  Proof Let X be a decision pattern. From the definition of the decision patterns, we know there is a positive document d 0 such that X  d 0 that is d 0   X   Given a term t   termset  X  d in g  to  Definition 2 we have t  d for all d    X  that is t   d 0  X Therefore C  X  termset   X    X We also have X   C  X om theorem 1, and hence we have X  C  X    4. Rough Association Rules  One important factor is missed in both closed patterns and decision patterns: the duplications of terms in a document. This factor is very import in terms of information retrieval.  To consider this factor we start to initialize this problem by using decision tables as multidimensional databases  Table 3 A decision table  Granule t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 Positive N g  g 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 yes 80 g 2  0 0 2 1 0 1 0 yes 140 g 3  0 0 3 1 1 1 0 yes 40 g 4  0 0 1 1 1 1 0 yes 450 g 5  1 1 0 0 0 1 1 yes 20 g 6  2 1 0 0 0 1 1 yes 200 g 7 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 no 20 g 8 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 no 50  Table 3 demonstrates the corresponding decision table G  A C  A D if we consider the duplications of terms in Table 2, where the numbers are frequencies of terms in the corresponding documents, the set of granules G   g 1  g 2  g 3  g 4  g 5  g 6  g 7  g 8 the set of condition attributes  A C  t 1  t 2  t 3  t 4  t 5  t 6  t 7 and the set of decision attributes  A D  Positive  Each granule is also mapped into a decision rule e.g g 1 in Table 3 can be read as the following positive rule t 1  t 2 1  Positive  yes    Let termset  g  t 1 205 t k formally every granule g in Table 3 determines a sequence  t 1  f  t 1  g 205 t k  f  t k  g  Positive  g  The sequence can determine a decision rule  t 1  f  t 1  g 205 t k  f  t k  g   Positive  g  or in short g  A C   g  A D  Normally, we would obtain more such decision rules than using the binary decision table, and there exists ambiguity when we use them for making 


decisions. For example, give an instance of a piece of information that contains only four terms t 3  t 4  t 5 and  t 6 but we can find two rules\222 premises g 3 and g 4 in Table 3\ match this instance To remove such ambiguities, in this section we present the concept of rough association rules in order to compose some decision rules into a single granule if they have the same termset We also use a weight distribution for the granule to specify the possible semantic meaning in it  4.1 Definitions  For every attribute t A C   its domain is denoted as  V t especially in the above example V t is the set of all natural numbers. Also A C determines a binary relation I  A C  G such that g i  g j   I  A C d only if termset  g i  termset  g j  It is easy to prove that I  A C is an equivalence relation, and the family of all equivalence classes of I  A C that is a partition determined by A C is denoted by G  A C The classes in G  A C are referred to A C granules or called the set of condition granules\. The class which contains g i is called A C granule induced by g i and is denoted by A C  g i We also can obtain A D granules  G  A D or called the set of decision granules in parallel For example, using Table 3, we can get the set of condition granules G  A C  g 1  g 7  g 2  g 3  g 4   g 5  g 6  g 8 and the set of decision granules G  A D   Positive  yes  Positive  no  g 1  g 2  g 3  g 4  g 5  g 6  g 7  g 8 respectively. In the following we let  G  A C  cg 1  cg 2  cg 3  cg 4  cg 5 and G  A D  dg 1  dg 2  We also need to consider the weight distribution of terms for the condition granules in order to consider the factor of the frequencies of terms in documents Let cg i be g i1  g i2 205 g im we can obtain a frequency distribution for terms t j in these documents using the following equation  C At i ij j cgt cgt tf     4.1 where  we use the composition  operation \(see [1 t o  assign a value to condition granules\222 attributes, which satisfies t  cg i  f  t  g i1  f  t  g i2  f  t  g im  for all t A C  Table 4 illustrates A C granules and A D granules we obtain from Table 3 according to the above definitions where each condition granule consists of both a termset and a frequency distribution For example cg 1  t 1  t 2 4/7, 3/7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\> or in short cg 1  t 1 4/7 t 2 3/7 Table 4 Granules  Condition granule t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7  cg 1 4/7 3/7  cg 2    1/2 1/4 1/4 cg 3    2/5 1/5 1/5 1/5 cg 4 1/3 2/9    2/9 2/9 cg 5 1/2 1/2 a A C granules  Decision granule Positive  dg 1 yes dg 2  no b A D granules   Using the associations between condition granules and decision granules, we can rewrite the eight decision rules in Table 4 as follows cd 1  dg 1 80/100  dg 2 20/100 cd 2   dg 1 140/140 cd 3    dg 1 490/490 cd 4   dg 1 220/220 cd 5   dg 2 50/50 Formally the association can be represented as the following mapping  1  0     2 C A C A G G  where    1,1 i i cgicgi ii i wdgwdgcg  a set of A D granule float pairs, the set of conclusions of premise cg i  i 1, \205 G  A C ich satisfies       i jii ji cg dgcg w  and 1   w i cgwdg for all cg i G  A C  We can also define a support function for the condition granules based on their frequencies  C i Acg cgg g cgg g i N N cg   G sup  for all cg i G  A C It is obvious that sup is a probability function on G  A C Therefore, the pair  sup  association set as defined in  We call \223  jii dgcg  224 a rough association rule its strength is sup  cg i   w i,j and its certainty factor is w i,j  where 1  j    cg i 223  jii dgcg  224 can be either a positive decision rule dg i  j is \223 Positive  yes 224\ or a negative decision rule dg i  j is \223 Positive  no 224 According to the above discussion, we use an alternative way to represent granules into a 2-tier structure. Figure 1 illustrates a 2-tiers structure for the representation of rough associations between condition granules and decision granules. The 1 st tier, the left 


hand, is A C granules and the 2 nd tier, the right hand, is A D granules The relationship between the two tiers is described as an association set  sup e association set also can determine a probability distribution on the set of decision granules \(see [1         i Ci cgwdgAcg i wcg dg G sup Pr   sup G  A C    cg i  0.10 cg 1    dg 1 0.8  dg 2 0.2 0.14 cg 2    dg 1 1  0.49 cg 3    dg 1 1  0.22 cg 4    dg 1 1  0.05 cg 5    dg 2 1  Figure 1 A 2-tier structure for rough associations between condition granules and decision granules  Let n be the number of granules in the decision table, it is obvious G  A C   n In addition, to obtain all decision rules in a decision table, the traditional method needs to search in the table to determine the conclusions for each condition.  The 2-tier structure does not need to search any more. Therefore, it is better of using the 2-tier structure than using a decision table in time complexity  4.2 Updating Rough Association Rules  Let Rule  be the set of positive rough association rules. We use the following weight function to determine the relevance of documents weight  term   cgftermRuledgcg fcg    sup  Given a testing document d we use the following equation for using rough association rules to determine its relevance  dtermVterm D termweight drel    4.2 The consequential result of using Equation \(4.2\ is that many irrelevant documents may be marked in relevance. To avoid making many mistakes, we now consider how to update the positive rough association rules based on some interesting negative rough association rules Give a negative rough association rule \223 cg    dg 2  x  224, where termset  cg  t 1  t 2 205 t m We call it an interesting  negative rule if rel  termse t cg   min  rel  d  d D   We use the following procedure to update some positive rough association rules for all interesting negative rules cg in our experiments for i 1 to G  A C  if termset  cg i  termset  cg    subtract half sup from cg i   else if termset  cg i  termset  cg     reshuffe  cg i 222s term frequency distribution by shifting half weights from all terms termset  cg i  termset  cg  to cg i 222s rest terms For example, \223 cd 5   dc 2 1 224 is an interesting negative rule \(see in Figure 1 and Table 4\ and it does not include any condition granules but we have that termset  cd 2  termset  cd 5  termset  cd 3  termset  cd 5  t 3  t 4   Therefore reshuffle operation can be used to update the frequency distributions of cd 2 and cd 3 We first take half weight from both t 3 and t 4 The total weights we can take from cg 2 and cg 3 are \(1/4 + 1/8\ 3/8 and \(1/5 1/10\ = 3/10, respectively. We also distribute the total weight 3/8 to t 6 for cg 2 and 3/10 to both t 5 and t 6  for cg 3   Table 5 Reshuffle operation   Table 5 illustrates the result of reshuffling term frequency distributions for condition granules cd 2 and cd 3 where cd 5 is the negative rule. To compare with the weights in Table 4, we can find that the weights of t 3 and t 4 in granules cd 2 and cd 3 are weakened respectively because t 3 and t 4  are terms of  cd 5   5. Evaluation  We use Reuters Corpus Volume 1, also known as RCV1, to evaluate the proposed method. We also use the first 20 topics that TREC \(Text REtrieval Conference, see http://trec.nist.gov eveloped for filtering track in 2002 We compare rough association rule mining model with two baseline models: closed pattern based association rule model \(see Section 2 for details\, and binary decision rule model \(see Section 3\  A common basic text processing is used for all models, which includes case folding, stemming, stop words removal and 150 term selection that uses tf*idf term frequency times inverse document frequency\ technique In the training phase, the closed pattern based model finds all closed patterns \(where the min_sup is Condition granule t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7  cg 1 4/7 3/7 cg 2  1/4 1/8  5/8  cg 3  1/5 1/10 7/20 7/20  cg 4 1/3 2/9  2/9 2/9 cg 5 1/2 1/2  


the double of the average frequency of terms, and the size of largest patterns is 5\ and calculates their support and confidence values. In the testing phase the relevance of document d is the sum of the multiplications of support and confidence of all closed patterns that occur in d  The binary decision rule model, first obtains a set of granules G in the training phase. It also uses the following equation to evaluate a weight for each term    gtermGg gtermset gstrength termweight      Given a testing document d we also use Equation 4.2\ to determine its relevance in binary decision rule model Table 6 is the experimental results. We use two measures in the table top 25 precision and breakeven points where a breakeven point is a point in the precision and recall curve with the same x coordinate and y coordinate  Table 6 Experimental results Rough association rules Binary decision rules Closed association rules Avg. of breakeven points 0.51 0.48 0.49 Avg. of top25 precision 55.00 50.60% 49.20  Figure 2 shows the differences of rough association mining, binary decision rule mining and closed pattern based association rule mining in top 25 precision for the 20 topics. The positive values \(the bars above the horizontal axis\ mean the rough association mining performed better than others. The negative values \(the bars below the horizontal axis mean others performed better than rough association mining                                        60.00 40.00 20.00 0.00 20.00 40.00 60.00 80.00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314151617181920 Topic Precisio n   Rough-Binary  Rough-Closed   Figure 2 Difference between models  It is no less impressed by the performance of the rough association rule mining since both top 25 precision and breakeven points gain a significant increase. As a result of the experiment we believe that the proposed method is significant since they can improve the effectiveness of the association discovery for Web text mining  6. Related Work  The key issue regarding the effectiveness of WIG is automatic acquiring of knowledge from text documents for describing user profiles  13   It i s also a fundamental issue in Web personalization [3   Traditional information retrieval \(IR\ techniques can be used to provide simple solutions for this problem. We can classify the methods into two categories: single-vector models and multi-vector models. The former models produce one term-weight vector to represent the relevant information for the topic [4  17 T he l a t t e r m o de l s  pr od uc e  m ore  t ha n one vector [1 9  Th e m ain dr awb ack  o f I R b ased  models is that it is hard to interpret the meaning of vectors using user acceptable concepts Text mining tries to derive meaning from documents. Association mining has been used in Web text mining for such purpose for association discovery trends discovery, event discovery, and text classification [6  8 1 9  The association between terms and categories \(e.g a term or a set of terms\can be described as association rules. The trends discovery means the discovery of phrases, a sort of sequence patterns. The event discovery is the identification of stories in continuous news streams   Us ua l l y c l us t e r i ng ba s e d mining techniques can be used for such a purpose. It was also necessary to combine association rule mining with the existing taxonomies in order to determine useful patterns [1    To compare with IR-based models, data miningbased Web text mining models do not use term independent assumption 1 4   A l s o W e b m i n i ng models try to discover some unexpected useful data    T he di s a dv a nt a g e  of a s s oc i a t i on ru l e m i ni n g i s t ha t  the discovered knowledge is very general what makes the performance of text mining systems ineffectively 2 Decision rule mining [16  12   23  c a n be  a  possible solution to specify association rules However, there exists ambiguities whist we use the decision rules for determining other relevance information for specified topics. Rough association 


rule mining can be used to overcome these disadvantages  7. Conclusions  This paper, discusses the application of data mining techniques within Web documents to discover what users want. It introduces the concept of decision patterns in order to interpret decision rules in terms of association mining. It has proved that any decision pattern is a closed pattern. It also presents a new concept of rough association rules to improve of the quality of text mining. To compare with the traditional association mining, the rough association rules include more specific information and can be updated dynamically to produce more effective results The distinct advantage of rough association rules is that they can take away some uncertainties from discovered knowledge through updating supports and weight distributions of association rules. It also demonstrates that the proposed approach gains a better performance on both precision and recall, and it is a considerable alternative of association rule mining This research is significant since it takes one more step further to the development of data mining techniques for Web mining  References   M.

With interpretation I1 we mine closed frequent itemsets and then we remove those ones which do not satisfy the CAM constraint: this way we lose the whole information contained in those equivalence classes cut by the CAM constraint. On the other hand, according to interpretation I2, we mine the set of itemsets which satisfy the CAM constraint and then we compute the closure of such itemsets collection: thus, by de?nition, the itemsets bd and cd are solutions because they satisfy CAM and they have not a superset in the result set with the same support and satisfying the constraint Which one of the two di?erent interpretations is the most reasonable? It is straightforward to see that interpretation I1 is not a condensed representation since it loses a lot of information. In extreme cases it could output an empty solutions set even if there are many frequent itemsets which satisfy the given set of user-de?ned constraints. On the other hand, interpretation I2, which corresponds to the de?nition Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM representation of FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all 


Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all closed itemsets which are under the CAM border \(as I1 plus those itemsets which arise in equivalence classes which are cut by the CAM border \(such as for instance ce and cde in Figure 3\(a Proposition 3 Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq ?

This could be an alternative. However since closed itemsets provide a much more meaningful set of association rules, we consider a good tradeo? among performance, conciseness and meaningfulness the use of Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq?CM resentation Finally, if we use free sets instead of closed, we only shift the problem leading to a symmetric situation. Using free sets interpretations I1 and I2 coincide when dealing with anti-monotone constraints because minimal elements are not cut o? by the constraint \(e.g. de in Fig. 3\(a constraints \(e.g. no free solution itemsets in Fig. 3\(b Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 4. Algorithms In this Section we study algorithms for the computation of MP5. We ?rst discuss separately how monotone and anti-monotone constraints can be pushed in the computation, then we show how they can be exploited together by introducing the CCIMiner algorithm 4.1. Pushing Monotone Constraints Pushing CAM constraints deep into the frequent itemset mining algorithm \(attacking the problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM  since they behave exactly as Cfreq . The case is di?erent for CM constraints, since they behave exactly the opposite of frequency. Indeed, CAM constraints can be used to e?ectively prune the search space to a small downward closed collection, while the upward closed collection of the search space satisfying the CM constraints cannot be exploited at the same time. This tradeo? holding on the search space of the computational problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CM extensively studied [18, 9, 4], but all these studies have failed to ?nd the real synergy of these two opposite types of constraints, until the recent proposal of ExAnte [6]. In that work it has been shown that a real synergy of the two opposites exists and can be exploited by reasoning on both the itemset search space and the transactions input database 


set search space and the transactions input database together According to this approach each transaction can be analyzed to understand whether it can support any solution itemset, and if it is not the case, it can be pruned In this way we prune the dataset, and we get the fruitful side e?ect to lower the support of many useless itemsets, that in this way will be pruned because of the frequency constraint, strongly reducing the search space. Such approach is performed with two successive reductions  reduction \(based on monotonicity reduction \(based on anti-monotonicity to  reduction we can delete transactions which do not satisfy CM , in fact no subset of such transactions satis?es CM and therefore such transactions cannot support any solution itemsets. After such reduction, a singleton item may happen to become infrequent in the pruned dataset, an thus it can be deleted by the ?reductions. Of course, these two step can be repeated until a ?xed point is reached, i.e. no more pruning is possible. This simple yet very e?ective idea has been generalized in an Apriori-like breadth-?rst computation in ExAMiner [5], and in a FP-growth [10] based depth-?rst computation in FP-Bonsai [7 Since in general depth-?rst approaches are much more e?cient when mining closed itemsets, and since FP-Bonsai has proven to be more e?cient than ExAMiner, we decide here to use a FP-growth based depth?rst strategy for the mining problem MP5. Thus we combine Closet [16], which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining closed frequent itemset, with FPBonsai, which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining frequent itemset with CM constraints 4.2. Pushing Anti-monotone Constraints Anti-monotone constraints CAM can be easily pushed in a Closet computation by using them in the exact same way as the frequency constraint, exploiting the downward closure property of antimonotone constraints. During the computation, as soon as a closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X ered, we can prune X and all its supersets by halting the depth ?rst visit. But whenever, such closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X e.g. bcd in Figure 3\(a some itemsets Y ? X belonging to the same equivalence class and satisfying the constraint may exist \(e.g bd and cd in Figure 3\(a ery such X in a separate list, named Edge, and after the mining we can reconstruct such itemsets Y by means of a simple top-down process, named Backward-Mining, described in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 Backward-Mining Input: Edge, C, CAM , CM C is the set of frequent closed itemsets CAM is the antimonotone constraint CM is a monotone constraint \(if present Output: MP5 1: MP5 = C split Edge by cardinality 2: k = 0 3: for all c ?

Closed Constrained Itemsets Miner The two techniques which have been discussed above are independent.

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
