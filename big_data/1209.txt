An Effective Hypergraph Clustering in Multi-Stage Data Mining of Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Differentiation   Wang Bo, Zhang Ming-Wei, Zhang Bin, Wei Wei-Jie College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110004 China wb_neu@126.com   Abstract  Traditional Chinese Medicine is mysterious for its special diagnosis and treatment. In TCM, Syndrome differentiation is the method of recognizing and 
diagnosing diseases or body imbalances in TCM. In this paper, we first give a hierarch model of differentiation syndrome in Traditional Chinese Medicine According to the model data mining procedure is designed to complete it. Given special data mining schema and character of high-dimensional data sets, we introduce hypergraph based on greedy algorithm in cluster and similarity measure during clustering stage. Finally, the experiment shows that the hypergraph clustering is correct and efficient, which in return could be important for association rules and 
diagnosis  1. Introduction  Traditional Chinese Medicine \(TCM\ had been known for more than 5000 years in which formed a special system to diagnose and cure illness in ancient China. Syndrome differentiation is the method of recognizing and diagnosing diseases or body imbalances in TCM. It involves analysis and synthesis of symptoms data obtained by the four examination methods. This enables the doctor to determine at which stage the disease has been developed, its location, and 
the degree of opposing force between the body resistance and the pathogenic factors otherwise known in TCM as the evils. Syndrome decides diagnosis diagnosis decides medicine, and Medicine decides curative effect. So, syndrome differentiation is the key to doctor in TCM. On the basis of \223National key Technologies R&D Program in the 10th Five-year Plan\224, we designed a five-tier model for syndrome differentiation of children pneumonia. We are trying to find syndrome differentiation criterion through 
clustering and association. In TCM, there are thousands of data objects with several hundreds of dimensions KDD \(Knowledge Discovery in Databases\ is a process to find correct, novel and potentially useful knowledge T h e r e  a r e s o m e c l us t e r i ng a l go r i t hm s i n KDD, such as CLARANS[2  DB SC AN 3   BIRCH[4  ST I NG 5  W a v e r C l u st e r  6   De n C l u e  7   and CLIQUE[8  A l th o u g h a ll o f th em can f in d  clusters, they may be involved in trouble with highdimensional data. Besides, correlation can not be 
described by distance similarity. To solve it, we need to explore a more general type of clustering to measure the distance between two objects Graph theory is effective for high-dimensional space. According to [9  ea c h  d a ta  i t em i s  r ep r es en t ed  as a vertex and related data items are connected with weighted hyperedges in a hypergraph model. A hyperedge represents a relationship \(affinity\ among subsets of data and the weight of the hyperedge reflects 
the strength of this affinity Graph-based clustering has two different procedures.  One is partitioning algorithm, through which a graph is partitioned into unconnected subgraphs. The other is agglomerate algorithm, through which sub-graph is connected to be one or satisfying ones The paper presents a greedy algorithm to realize sub-graph connection for graph clustering. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Model of TCMSD is presented in section 2. Section 3 introduces clustering 
model and theory of hypergraph.  In Section 4 the proposed algorithm based on greedy. Results from TCM are given in Section 5 and section 6 deals with Conclusions  2. TCMSD  2.1. Model of TCMSD  


Syndrome differentiation is the method of recognizing and diagnosing diseases or body imbalances in TCM. It involves analysis and synthesis of the clinical data obtained by the four examination methods. This enables the doctor to determine at which stage the disease has been developed, its location, and the degree of opposing force between the body resistance and the pathogenic factors otherwise known in TCM as the evils    Figure  1  Five-tier model of a disease in TCM   2.2. Raw data from TCM  The Case Report Form \(CRF\s an important tool used in clinical trials. It captures a required record of data and other information for each patient during a clinical trial as defined by the clinical protocol. The data are stored electronically in database, and usually each subject has at least one CRF There are 78 attributes in raw data. Figure 2 shows a set of 3 objects with 11 attributes. We can see that domain of data is in [-1, 3 B eca u s e v a l u es ar e discrete, there are only four values, in which -1 represents null, and 0,1,2,3 represent degree of an attribute \(symptom                            Figure  2 Raw data  2.3. The data mining schema  Syndrome is interpreted as collection of different symptoms, and each symptom have different weighted value at different syndrome. First, we can find syndromes \(clusters\ via cluster process. When object value\ clusters are completed, we can acquire symptom \(attribute\ clusters through computing symptoms\222 probability in each syndrome. Specialists need to rename the clusters because of unsupervised procedure. Then, three-grade symptoms based on syndromes \(clusters\ can be built through association process: differential symptoms, primary symptoms and secondary symptoms. Finally, criterion of syndrome for diagnosis can result from cluster and association According to the above description, we can confirm the schema of data mining  Figure  3 The 4-stage data mining process  3. CLUSTERING ANALYSIS MODEL  3.1. Clustering analysis and its model  The aim of cluster mining is to confirm syndrome There are two steps: Object clustering, generalized clustering process, generate clusters via clustering algorithm; Attribute computing, statistical symptoms acquire probability of each syndrome in a cluster. Thus each cluster is called syndrome. Syndrome is named by the expert. Because of symptom \(attribute\ cluster and high dimension, we have a hypergraph method to complete  Figure  4 Clustering process  3.2.

Hypergraph algorithm for clustering related items consists of the following two steps[9 D u r i n g t h e f i r s t  step, the weighted hypergraph H is constructed to represent the relations among different items and subgraphs come into being. During the second step, a hypergraph agglomerate algorithm is used to combine sub-graphs until algorithm terminates The choice of distance function has great implications on the meaning of similarity, and this is particularly important in subspace clustering because of computational complexity. Hence, we need a distance function that makes measuring of the similarity between two objects in high dimensional space meaningful and intuitive, and generating an efficient implementation Definition 1 Assumed vectors x  1 x  2 x 205 n x nd y  1 y  2 y 205 n y are the two objects max i and min i  represent max value and min value on attribute i i is integer and n i 002 212 212 212 002   1 If similarity satisfies the use specified threshold, we can divide the two objects into one group  4. Hypergraph clustering based on Greedy algorithm  4.1. Greedy algorithm  A greedy algorithm repeatedly executes a procedure which tries to maximize the return based on examining local conditions, with the hope that the outcome will lead to a desired outcome for the global problem. In some cases such a strategy is guaranteed to offer optimal solutions, and in some other cases it may provide a compromise that produces acceptable approximations Typically, the greedy algorithms employ simple strategies that are simple to implement and require minimal amount of resources  4.2.

Experimental Evaluations  5.1. The results of cluster analysis  The procedure uses a 1.5GHz Pentium IV PC with 1GB of main memory, running Windows 2000 professional. All algorithms are coded in Visual C 6.0. There are 6576 data of children pneumonia are collected from the 15 hospitals Most of these patients have experienced several unknown syndromes, and each syndrome includes some symptoms, such as high fever, cough, red tongue etc. All patients in the used dataset were under drug treatment. Because of too many data, we just describe some main symptoms of the one of all patients Table 1 Original dataset used for clustering  Object value symptom 0 1 2 3 1 Fever high cough  medium tongue body red   tongue coating yellow   complexion pale   color of phlegm  yellow sound of phlegm ring in the throat  perspiration some   headache yes   pulse  smooth 205\205  Tip: There is only one value in each symptom  When num of clusters=4 and similarity threshold=0.75 in hypergraph clustering, the first result of clustering \(object clustering\is described in Table.2 Table  2 Result of clustering  No of cluster Number of objects Cluster1 3045 Cluster2 2011 Cluster3 842 Tip:  Except for the above data, there are 148 objects need to be judged as outliers  5.2. The data mining results after clustering using hypergraph method  We acquire some important attributes through computing attribute probability in each cluster According to experience and above results, the expert gives names of cluster \(so called syndrome\ shown in Table.3 Table 3 Rename the syndromes  No of cluster Name of syndrome Cluster1 Yin and xu pneumonia Cluster2 Phlegm and hot pneumonia Cluster3 Wind and cold pneumonia  5.3. Performance evaluations  When we attempt to cluster using k-means algorithm, clique and hypergraph algorithms under the same condition, we find clique algorithm can not be executed when number of dimension exceed 10 Results are shown as table 4 when number of dimension is 40. Accuracy of the three algorithms is obtained with expert\222s verification Table 4 Comparison of three cluster algorithms  Algorithm Run Time\(second\ Accuracy k-means 189 57 clique greedy hypergraph 206 92 We can observe from the figure 8 that the run time of greedy algorithm tends to increase as the number of records. However, greedy algorithm is obviously faster than traditional hypergraph and graph algorithm              Figure 8 Run time with number of records   6. Conclusions   


Because TCM data is different from medical data we analyze it with special method or model. It is important to design the appropriate hierarchy model Based on it, we can complete it via data mining methods. Considering traditional clustering algorithms handle TCM data unsatisfactorily, the paper presents a hypergraph based on greedy algorithm for clustering procedure. Experimental results demonstrate correctness and efficiency of our algorithm  Acknowledge  This research has been supported by the National key Technologies R&D Program in the 10th Five-year Plan of China Grant No 2004BA721A05   References   1 Fa y y a d U   P i a t e t s k y Sha p i r o  G   Sm y t h P K n o w l e dg e  discovery and data mining: towards a unifying framework In: Simoudis, E., Han, J., Fayyad, U.M., eds.

An average effect stands for R²-values between 0.67 and 0.34. The explanatory power is weak for an R² between 0.34 and 0.19 and overall not relevant for R²-values under 0.19 [1    Figure 2: Structural model validation   Therefore R² of our research model for the intention to use self- and e-assessment can be categorized as substantial expressive for perceived usefulness and as an average effect for intention  4.4. Results  The results of our empirical research based on our explorative case study is that the intention to use self and e-assessments can be explained by Davis perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use Furthermore antecedents of perceived usefulness are perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings derived of the MATH e ll as th e [36]. Statistical  support can be provided for all the hypothesized relations between constructs except of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness  5. Limitations  As with any work in a new field of research relevant literature about self- and e-assessments to build on is almost nonexistent. Unfortunately the operationalization of "perceived cost and time savings" as well as perceived quality improvements  in this paper could consequently not build on earlier work too much so we had to derive them of the MATH m  w e ll as t h e UT A U T  36   As with any empirical field study, this work has limitations. It is important to note that we have build an explorative model to examine the acceptance of self- and e-assessments. As this study provides support for a significant influence of PU and PEOU Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
