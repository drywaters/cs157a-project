Previous work on medical data only focus on biphenotypes medical data However with the fast development of medical technique it is invitable to classify multiple medical data In this paper we rst de渡e two patterns adapting an interestingness measure by statics method and then propose a new algorithm called MVP that is specially designed to discover such two patterns At last applies the discovered optimal rule sets to classify multiple medical data The key advantage of MVP as compared to other techniques for pattern discovery is that MVP directly nds the interesting patterns which are non-redundancy and 
sense in a speci田 domain The experiment results demonstrate the proposed method enables the user to focus on fewer rules and to be assured that the survival rules are all medical domain interesting The classi兎r build on the rules generated by our method outperforms existing classi兎rs 1 Introduction The latest advances in biomedical technology results in a new type of dataset which contains multiple phenotypes and potentially even more subtypes For example there are over a hundred types of cancer in and potentially e v en more subtypes However current techniques are only lim 
ited in their ability to distinguish several pairs of phenotypes such as abnormal and normal Man y medical data are incorrectly classi兎d due to their ability to classi田ation For any practical applications it is essential to develop an algorithm for multiple phenotype medical data Previous studies have developed heuristic/greedy search techniques for building classi兎rs such as decision trees 5 6 nai v e-Bayes classi田ation 10 and statistical ap The work was supported by the fteen tackle key problem project of National Science and Technology Department under grant 
no.2004BA721A05 proaches These techniques induces a representati v e subset of rules e.g a decision tree or a set of rules from training data sets for quality prediction Recent studies propose the extraction of a set of high quality association rules from the training data set which satisfy certain user-speci兎d frequency and con電ence thresholds Effective and ef田ient classi兎rs have been built by careful selection of rules e.g CBA CAEP 4 Such a method takes the most effective rule\(s from among all the rules mined for classi田ation Since association rules explore highly con電ent associations among multiple vari 
ables it may overcome some constraints introduced by a decision-tree induction method which examines one variable at a time Some research and extensive performance studies sho w that association based classi田ation may have better accuracy in general However this approach may also suffer some weakness as shown below On one hand it is not easy to identify the most effective rule in a speci田 domain Some method such as 2 simply selects a rule with a maximal user-de渡ed measure such as con電ence However such a selection may not always be the right choice in many cases There are a lot of 
proposed interestingness criteria for association rule mining and a comprehensive comparison has been conducted in Some e v aluation w ork on medical data sets has been reported in Ho we v e r  most criteria do not mak e sense to medical practitioners So selecting the most interestingness measurewe in a speci田 domain is important and necessary On the other hand a training data set often generates a huge set of rules The outcome results in too man y tri vial and similar patterns which is also a problem for classi田ation However it is important to select the right measure for a given application domain Utilizing the measure some 
uninteresting rule will be prune ef田iently Hence in order to achieve high accuracy a classi兎r may have to handle a large set of rules including storing pruning and sorting a large number of rules The main contributions of this work are as follows First we de渡e the interesting measure based on statis1-4244-0605-6/06/$20.00 ｩ2006 IEEE 775 


tic method and proposed two new patterns vital pattern and protect pattern based the interesting measure which derives a good measure on how strong the rule is under both interestingness and class distribution Second We proposed a new algorithm named MVP based pre度 tree to discover vital patterns and protect patterns from multiple phenotypes disease reducing the redundant rules and obtaining the maximal interesting rules in medical application which break though the limitation of previous work that only contrast abnormal with normal samples to obtain the disease patterns Instead of relying on a single rule for classi田ation we construct a classi兎r with optimal patterns for classi田ation multiple phenotypes medical data An extensive performance study shows that the classi兎r in general has higher classi田ation accuracy than CBA  and C4.5 5 Third Utilizing the vital patterns and protect patterns discovered to perform a causal analysis of a medical data set which are more clear than association rules From the viewpoint of biomedical researcher it is more suitable to analysis the medical data set The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 give some preliminary and problem de渡ition In section 3 we present the ef田ient mining VP and PP based pre度 tree and propose an algorithm for implement it Experimental results are described in Section 4 We summarize our research and discuss some future work directions in Section 5 2 PROBLEM DEFINITION In this section we introduce some basic concepts and give the problem de渡ition 2.1 The Basics A multiple phenotype medical dataset D consists of a set of rows S   S 1 S 2   S m   and a set of columns A  P 1 P 2 P n T   where the rows denote patients the rst n columns denote attributes\(i.e symptoms and the nal column T   T 1 T 2   T k  is the complete set of class labels of D As an example table 1 shows a three phenotypes medical dataset with 12 patients and 4 symptoms each patient S i  S consists of one or more attributes from A and a class label from T Note that every attributes have different expression values which can evaluate the degree of the symptom The footnotes 1 2 3 and 4 denote different values of the symptoms respectively Below we rst give some de渡itions used consistently throughout this paper De渡ition 1 P denoted a pattern N denote the records of the dataset The support of pattern P is the ratio of the Table 1 An example of a three phenotypes medical data  A B C D CLASS A 0 B1 C2 D1 T1 A 0 B1 C2 D3 T1 A 0 B1 C2 D1 T1 A 1 B1 C2 D1 T1 A 0 B0 C2 D1 T2 A 0 B0 C2 D1 T2 A 1 B1 C0 D1 T2 A 1 B1 C2 D1 T2 A 1 B1 C2 D2 T3 A 2 B0 C2 D1 T3 A 2 B0 C2 D1 T3 A 2 B0 C2 D1 T3 number of records containing P to the number of all records in the data set denoted by supp\(P  Supp  P  Count  P  N For example The number of data set is N there are x records contain the pattern P than supp\(P A pattern P is usually called frequent if supp\(P    is a give threshold De渡ition 2 Let D be a dataset with attribute A A  P 1 P 2   P n   Let P   P 1 P 2 P l  A\(l=1,2,...,n be an attribute or a subset of attributes We called an attribute value or a set of attribute-value pairs a Pattern  De渡ition 3 Let P be a pattern and T k  T be a phenotype The intra-class support of pattern P in phenotype T k is the ratio of the number of records containing P with the phenotype T k to the number of phenotype T k in the data set Intra Supp is an abbreviation of Intra Support  Intra Supp  P  T k  Support  P  T k  Support  T k  De渡ition 4 The Pre度 Rule Sets I  Pa Pab Pabcde  satisfy Pa  T k Pab  T k  Pabcde  T k  if there not exist pattern P   P and P   T k  then we called pattern P the General Pattern which induce T k  If there not exist Pabcde  P   and P   T k  then we called pattern Pabcde the Speci田 Pattern which induce T k  Lemma 1 If P be a Pattern where P    Pa is a super pattern of P and T k k=1,2,3 be a class then Supp\(Pa  Supp\(P Proof Omitted Theorem 1 If P be a Pattern where P    Pa is a super pattern of P and T k k=1,2,3 be a class then Intra Supp  Pa  T k   Intra Supp  P  T k   Corollary 1 Let P be a Pattern where P    Px is a super pattern of P and T i i=1,2,3 be a class We called the 1-4244-0605-6/06/$20.00 ｩ2006 IEEE 776

Moreover, in these algorithms, the reduction of synchronization level is possible, but at the cost of an increase of data replication and of redundant calculations which is not the case in our approach Concerning the count distribute algorithm and data distribute algorithm, they can adapt to diverse machine resources. However, contrary to our approach, their level of synchronization is high, which causes a significant reduction of their performance in highly distributed environments 4. Conclusion In this paper, the distributed dichotomous algorithm DDA association rule mining. The main features of our algorithm are that it does not require a high level of synchronization and that it works without data replication and redundant calculations. In addition, thanks to its flexibility, it can be applied to environments in which available computing resources are limited We are currently working on the implementation of the algorithm in different environments. Moreover, we shall compare the efficiency of DDA with other existing algorithms mentioned in this paper. We also pay attention to possible optimizations of the algorithm under different network environments. For example it is well known that the policy of data transfer depends on the network technology: in the presence of hubs, the information is transferred to all machines, whereas in the presence of switches, the information is transferred to the receivers only. It is clear that these different environments may have an impact on the way information transfer can be optimized in our algorithm References 1] Agrawal R. et al  Fast Discovery of Association Rules  Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, U Fayyad et al., eds., AAAI Press, Menlo Park, Calif., 1996 2] R.

Related work and conclusion Mining sequential patterns has been extensively studied in data mining community since the first research work in [1]. The earlier studies which focused on the large size of retail datasets have developed several Apriorilike algorithms in order to solve the problem of discovering sequential patterns from such databases However, the Apriori-like algorithms only perform well in databases consisting of short frequent sequences [17 This is caused by the fact that it is quite time-consuming to generate nTerms sequences candidates from \(n1 disadvantage of Apriori-like algorithms [1], a variety of algorithms such as PrefixSpan [17], SPADE [25 SLPMiner [22] and GST [12] have been proposed. In order to improve the efficiency, each algorithm pursues a different method of discovering frequent sequential patterns, which makes them featured by the capability of mining such patterns without even generating any candidates With respect to the representation of the content of documents, some research works have used phrases rather than individual words [21]. However, the effectiveness of the text mining systems was not improved very much. The likely reason is that, a phrasebased method has  lower consistency of assignment and lower document frequency for terms  21]. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel concept for mining text documents for sequential patterns. Instead of using single words, we use pattern-based taxonomy to represent documents. By pruning meaningless patterns which have been proven to be the source of the  noise   in this study, the problem of  overfitting  is solved and the experimental results which show the encouraging outcomes are achieved 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Pr e c is

  12  Figure 32 Bottom view of dual frequency antenna tile with perforated L-band patc h in lower layer with Kuband patches  Figure 33 Layer stack with perforated L-band patch in lower layer with Ku-band patches  8  B EAM FORMING N ETWORK  A major keystone for the su ccess of phased array antenna onboard aircraft is the capability of steering the main beam in the direction of the geosta tionary satellites. This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
