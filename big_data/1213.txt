cn Abstract Considering some employees 
in the department abuse their privilege for personal gain through the local network and the host computer in this paper we present a multi-agent based intrusion detection system named MAJIDS multi-agent based intelligent intrusion detection system The learning agent module in this model can self-adjustingly learn network based audit data and host based audit data with more than one technique of data mining such as the artificial neural network the association rules and 
so on The learning agent can produce rules and the detection agent can detect audit data according to these rules and response to them A lot of experiments indicate that this system has very high self-adapting ability intelligence and expansibility Now MAJIDS has been applied to several security departments and has received good reputation Keyword intrusion detection artificial intelligence data mining multi-agent 1 Introduction The detection is an important element of 
the computer network security As a hacker's attack methods become wiser and wiser and more and more computer safety commissions are done by in-house employees people's requirement upon computer safety gets more and more intense when they enjoy lots of convenience brought by computers The intrusion detection is essentially a data analysis process on network-based data or hostcomputer-based data it can real-timely detect intrusion actions based on network or host computers 
The network Intrusion detection system is a reasonable supplement on firewall it can real-timely monitor data stream in network The research on an intrusion detection system is an important matter in the computer security field and it has great theoretical significance and practical importance Extensive researches have been done in this field 1-5 12-13 and they have been mainly designed for network audit data The paper 14 is designed for Linux operation 
system Papers 6-1 1 give some agent-based intrusion detection system models These models are short of certification of modules agents in the model are short of efficient management and sufficient intelligence the communication among the agents is too fixed and cannot be extended All these problems limit the realization of Agents in the IDS So the purpose of the model that we proposed is to make the system more extensible more intelligent and 
more easily managed In this paper we present a self-adapting intelligent intrusion detection system model then we introduce data mining techniques and multi-agent techniques into the system and the experiments prove that the system has very high intelligence self-adapting ability and extensibility 2 Data mining techniques in a intrusion detection system Intrusion detection is essentially to extract integrate and analyze security audit data then to discover abnormal data 
or behaviors at last to respond to these audit data 15 An universal intrusion detection system process is shown as follows.\(Figure 1 Figurel An universal intrusion detection system process 2.1 Data mining techniques in intrusion detection With the computer network develops continuously various data and attack modes of network emerge in endlessly increasing with great speed So it is hard to analyze a mass of audit data with common methods So 290 


2006 1 st International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications it has a very strong adaptability for data mining techniques applied to intrusion detection Data mining techniques being applied to intrusion detection has some advantages as follows 1.Data mining techniques can analyze and process mass intrusion detection data resource especially adapt network-based intrusion detection system 16 2.1t has high practicability We can get a very visual conclusion through the data mining's analysis on the intrusion detection data such as IF-THEN and store them with rules repository 3.1t has a low fail-to-report rate When a new attack manner appears which never appeared before and could not be responded with a traditional method but through data mining techniques we can soon discover the attack So it reduces probability of fail-toreport to a high degree 4.Data mining techniques has high intelligence Many techniques and methods of data mining such as artificial neural network Bayesian network and association rules can auto adjust their limits selfadapting learning data resource after several learning they can converge the problem then get their results 2.2 Multi-Agent systems A Multi-Agent system is created on the basis of an agent which is an abstract and kernel concept A MultiAgent system is a very important aspect in the computer science field currently Some people consider that a single agent is like an individual member while a multi-agent system simulates the whole human society A Multi-Agent system is a system whose agents are loosely coupled but cooperate together and it has good flexibility and capability It embodies the development direction of the soft intelligence techniques in the distributed environment Besides it has the character of interaction sociality cooperatively adaptability and distributing etc it has the character of data distributing and scattering its computational process is asynchronous concurrent and parallel and each agent has incomplete problem solving capability 17 Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language KQML is a kind of communication language for agents At the same time it is a descriptive protocol for the information and knowledge exchanging The following example is a typical message KIF Knowledge Interchange Format is a kind of language which expresses knowledge on content of messages and it expresses knowledge based on one grade predication logic  ask-one sender DetectAgent content Normal\(AuditData receiver LearningAgent reply-with AuditContent language KIF ontology Monitor-mode  3 The Architecture 3.1 Framework of MAIIDS model Considering the weakness of that concentrative intrusion detection data processing becomes a bottleneck of network security and an agent is very effective and autonomous we build an intrusion detection system with distributed detection methods Agents with detection functions are distributed to every corner of network As a result it can monitor real-time data preferably and self-determiningly make decision and response Moreover invalidation of some local function unlikely affects whole system It can not only protect outer invading but also protect inner intrusion At the same time we have cognizance of that the agent is a self-determining computing entity so the action of agent is absolutely determined by agent itself according to its inner state therefore it has weakness of confusion and it is short of holistic conception and holistic control management on network Consequently it is necessary to manage Agents efficiently and plan as a whole besides from the role of practicability network systems currently adopt forms of delaminated structure management so systems must inosculate with fact delaminated protect manage from up to down and feedback information Figure 2 as follows shows the framework of our MAIIDS model Figure2 Framework of MAIIDS model Now we explain four important components of this model 1.Agents It includes detection agent and learning agent the detection agent runs in a detection host computer with a mode of autonomy It answers for collecting special network data packages system audit data and log information of application integrates abnormal detection and misuse detection then analyzes and detects at low level reports their detection result to their domain manager The learning agent according to 291 


2006 1 st International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications the knowledge repository and log repository in the domain learns data in these repositories with some appropriate data mining algorithm then updates knowledge repository 2.Domain manager It monitors and controls the state of its detection agents and learning agents offers content query and locator function for cooperation in detection agents and learning agents and it extract report information from agents at a low level and at last it submits its result to administrator center Some domain managers wholly take charge of the network data detection others answer for the host data detection A domain manager could also be designed as an agent 3.Administrator center It is the mutual interface between the system and the administrator it has friendly interface and convenient manipulation It takes charge of monitoring and controlling process of the domain manager and gathers reports of domain managers The administrator center has a power of collecting data in whole network system range At the same time it produces reports after more extracts on results of collecting then our administrator can clearly understand the result of the system running and detection and carry through man-made adjusting and control Besides the administrator center answers for application and deletion of domain for example if we want to add a host intrusion detection we can apply a domain about a host intrusion detection at the administrator center 4.Knowledge repository It storages rules and domain security strategy in a domain Log repository storages data system logs and application logs of collecting and analysis of detection agent it is a low level database 3.2 Self-study process of MAIIDS An important role of MAIIDS model is that the learning mechanism is introduced into the IDS So when the system runs learning agents can adopt appropriate data mining algorithms to constantly adjust and extend knowledge repository This mechanism make the IDS automatically adjust and dynamically adapt practical network environment enhance the function of the detection How it runs was shown in figure 3 Learning Agents carries through studying sufficiently with every fit data mining algorithms For example we introduce association rules learning techniques and decision tree techniques into learning agents And according to the result of learning the system will adjust or create a model of knowledge repository at the same time it will send message to domain manager to notify the knowledge repository has been updated After the manager received updating messages the domain broadcast the event of updating to all detection agents in the domain After that the domain manager and the related detection agents extract new rules and models from domain knowledge repository In the precondition of not stop running and not interrupting detection they dynamically update their own detection engine and knowledge repository At the necessary time the domain manager even reports new detection rules and models to other manager by cooperation relation so that other domains reduce repeated learning and rapidly update knowledge repository Figure3 How learning agent runs In the model of MAIIDS our learning agents adopt data mining techniques to study and sufficiently exert predominance of variant data mining techniques Learning agents models with data mining techniques is shown as follows.\(Figure 4 Atl4ficial Neutral Network Agentl _ updating kiowledge repository Association Rules Agent2 updating 1earng knowledge repository Figure4 Learning agents with data mining techniques 3.3 Cooperation of learning agents In the model MAIIDS we use several learning agents with data mining techniques We now explain the validity of the learning agents applying to audit data Leaning agents work as a filter in a chemical experiment In order to filter the bad impurity of some liquor we utilize filter paper but we need other filter method at the same time For example we first use filter paper then we add a reagent into the liquor at last we use pyrogenetic reaction or distillation to filter the bad impurity One learning agent may incur high error rate so we use several learning agents Learning agents cooperate and communicate each other when they work 292

2006 1 st International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications agents could work norrmally Besides if one agent e.g ID3 agent has higher fail-to-rate than other agents we deploy it in a lower layer which bring us more efficient learning results The computer security is always the focus of people's attentions so it is very valuable for an enterprise or corporation to design an intrusion detection system which can not only keep outer intrusion but also prevent inner from intrusion MAIIDS embodies intelligence extensibility and distributed character of intrusion detection In the future we plan to extend this work along the following dimensions 1.We did not consider the balance between the system efficiency and the system cost High efficiency always need high system cost We will do more work on reducing the system cost 2.We believe distributed IDS with data mining techniques is an importance area in information systems We will continue to research distributed intrusion detection system and combine it with data mining techniques including association rules and artificial intelligence in order to make it more intelligent Acknowledgements The authors thank the anonymous referees for their valuable and constructive comments Reference 1 Guy Helmer Johnny S.K Wong Vasant Honavar Les Miller and Yanxin Wang Lightweight agents for intrusion detection The Journal of Systems and Software 67 2003 page 109-122 2 Moon Sun Shin Eun Hee Kim and Keun Ho Ryu False Alarm Classification Model for Network-Based Intrusion Detection System IDEAL 2004 LNCS 3177 page 259-265 2004 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004 3 Tadeusz Pietraszek Using Adaptive Alert Classification to Reduce False Positives in Intrusion Detection  RAID 2004 LNCS 3224 page 102-124 2004 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004 4 Ricardo S Puttini Jean-Marc Percher  Ludovic Me A Modular Architecture for Distributed IDS in MANET  ICCSA 2003 LNCS 2669 page 91-113 2003 SpringerVerlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003 5 Oleg Kachirski Ratan Guha Effective Intrusion Detection Using Multiple Sensors in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks  Proceedings of the 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences HICSS'03 0-7695-18745/03 6 Yanxin Wang and Smruti Ranjan Behera Towards the automatic generation of mobile agents for distributed intrusion detection system  Journal of Systems and Software Volume 79 Issue 1 January 2006 page 1-14 7 Vaibhav Gowadia Csilla Farkas and Marco Valtorta PAID A Probabilistic Agent-Based Intrusion Detection system  Computers  Security Volume 24 Issue 7 8 D Dasgupta and F Gonzalez CIDS An agent-based intrusion detection system  Computers  Security Volume 24 Issue 5 August 2005 page 387-398 9 Jinqiao Yu and Y.V Ramana Reddy TRINETR An architecture for collaborative intrusion detection and knowledge-based alert evaluation  Advanced Engineering Informatics Volume 19 Issue 2 April 2005 page 93-101 10 Serge Fenet and Salima Hassas A distributed Intrusion Detection and Response System based on mobile autonomous agents using social insects communication paradigm  Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science Volume 63 May 2002 Pages 1-18 11 M Zaki and Tarek S Sobh A cooperative agentbased model for active security systems  Journal of Network and Computer Applications Volume 27 Issue 4 November 2004 Pages 201-220 12 Hee Suk Seo Network security agent DEVS simulation modeling Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory In Press Corrected Proof Available online 6 October 2005 13 Johnny S K Wong and Armin R Mikler Intelligent mobile agents in large distributed autonomous cooperative systems Journal of Systems and Software Volume 47 Issues 2-3 1 July 1999 Pages 75-87 14 S Jha and M Hassan Building agents for rule-based intrusion detection system  Computer Communications Volume 25 Issue 15 15 September 2002 Pages 13661373 15 Donghai Han,Chao Wang and Qun Lee Intrusion detection system instance analysis Tsinghua university press Peking,2002 16]Jiawei Han and Micheline Kamber Data Mining Concepts and Techniques China Machine Press,2001 17 M.J.Woolgridge Agent-based software engineering IEEE Trans on Software Engineering 1999.144\(1 18]Xiaodong Zhu and Cheng Zheng Research on hash pruning algorithm of association rules Journal of Anhui University\(Natural Sciences 2005,29\(4 20-23 19]Tom M.Mitchell Machine Learning 300 340,McGraw Hill 1997 October 2005 page 529-545 295

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
