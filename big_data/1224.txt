3rd International IEEE Conference Intelligent Systems September 2006 Ratio Rule Mining with Support and Confidence Factors Masafumi Hamamoto Hiroyuki Kitagawa Abstract Various data mining methods are being considered This paper examines the problem of extracting Ratio Rules Ratio Rules are linear relationships in numeric attributes applicable to understanding data filling missing attribute values and related issues Existing research for Ratio Rules however does not consider 
a concept used in association rule mining This prevents us from extracting a Ratio Rule having a strong linear relationship in part This also prevents us from measuring 
objective goodness of each Ratio Rule We formulated Ratio Rule mining 
a Ratio Rule extraction method based on support and confidence and show the appropriateness of our proposed method using real and synthetic data Index TermsRatio Rule association rule mining data mining Hough transformation I INTRODUCTION Various data mining methods are being considered to extract important information from huge data Some examples are association rule mining clustering classification text mining time series data mining 
in analogy to association rule mining and introduce support and confidence concepts to Ratio Rules We propose 
and Web data mining 1 This paper examines the problem of extracting Ratio Rules 2 Ratio Rules are typical ratios between numeric attributes Ratio Rules are linear relationships in numeric attributes As an example of Ratio Rules we assume the students data listed in Table I in which each student has been measured for both height and weight Figure 1 shows tuples in Table I mapped to 2D space This figure also shows that tuples generally follow the linear relationship indicated as a black solid line This line 
enables us to obtain ratio between height and weight from the slope of the line We call that kind of line a Ratio Rule Ratio Rules not only support the understanding of data but can help fill in missing values forecast attribute values detect outliers and visualize data Existing Ratio Rule mining methods 2][3 try to capture general trends as Ratio Rules so they are not applicable when linear relationships mix or given data partially have a linear relationship Figure 2 gives a simple example We think 
data have two linear relationships one stands between 0.0  X  0.7 and the other stands between 0.25  X

ATTRIBUTES ASSUME BOTH ATTRIBUTES HAVE NO MISSING VALUE 70r 65 60 3t 55Fig 1 Example of Ratio Rule for Table 1 Black solid line represents a Ratio Rule based on Principal Component Analysis 2 we obtain the Ratio Rule shown by the solid black line This Ratio Rule does not represent any linear relationship in the data thus it is not an appropriate result Another problem with existing Ratio Rule mining methods is that they do not consider concepts used in association rule mining such as support and confidence In 
Figure 2 a single linear relationship appears only in 0  X  0.2 and 0.7  X  1.0 and almost all tuples in the ranges follow linear relationships That means the linear relationships in the ranges have high confidence In 0.2  X  0.7 however two linear relationships are mixed It makes estimation from X to Y more difficult and confidence is low For this kind of data it is useful to extract appropriate Ratio Rules using support and confidence criteria In this paper we 
start by formulating the definition of Ratio Rules in analogy to association rules Based on this definition we classify target Ratio Rules into two kinds optimized confidence Ratio Rules and optimized support Ratio Rules To extract these Ratio Rules we propose an algorithm consisting of three phases parameter filtering optimized range extraction using ID numeric association rule mining 4 and Ratio Rules integration Our algo1-4244-0195-X/06/$20.00 2006 IEEE IStudent ID  height\(cm weight\(kg SOOOO1 157 50.1 S00002 174 69.0 S00003 163 60.8 1  11   500 


a line y ax  b is represented as p  xcosO  ysinO where p bsin\(tan-1\(-1/a and 0  tan1\(-1/a Since the domains of both attribute values x y are normalized to be 0,1 p and 0 are assumed to be0  p  2 and 7/2  0  7 When many tuples follow the same Ratio Rules density of the tuples may vary in different ranges If many tuples exist in a range we are able to say that the Ratio Rule in the range is approved with certainty However for a range in which very few tuples are included we do not trust the Ratio Rule in the range at all Thus we need to express it in our Ratio Rules definition Based on the above we define Ratio Rules as follows Fig range Extracting optimized confidence Ratio Rules is under the condition that a particular number of tuples are included extraction of the range in which the ratio of tuples following a Ratio Rule is maximized Extracting optimized support Ratio Rules is under the condition that a particular percentage of tuples follow the 501 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 6.7 0.8 0.9 1 X When tuple t\(xt Yt Xt C I I C 0 1 satisfies the following condition for Et St t is said to follow the Ratio Rule RRx I p 261 E 0 261 6d P  et  xt cos\(O  St  yt sin\(O  St where EtL  c l t  6 2 An example where multiple Ratio Rules exist Black solid line represents a Ratio Rule extracted by Principal Component Analysis rithm takes linear time for the number of tuples This paper is organized as follows Section II formulates Ratio Rules in analogy to association rules Section III presents our proposed method Section IV examines appropriateness and properties of our method with synthetic data and two real data Section V reviews related work We finish with a conclusion and mention future work II PROBLEM SETTING This section formulates Ratio Rules Our definition is slightly different from the existing one 2 3 since our Ratio Rules are more general as explained in Section I It then introduces concepts used in association rule mining Ratio Rule mining techniques are defined by these formulations A Target Data Target data in this paper are a set of tuples having numerical attributes like Table I in Section I We assume each attribute to have no missing values This paper focuses on extracting Ratio Rules between two attributes Each attribute value is assumed to be a real number but normalization done for each domain is 0,1 The two target attributes are assumed to be X Y and each attribute value is represented as x y 0  x y  1 B Definition of Ratio Rules Ratio Rules are as noted in Section I and the preceding subsection linear relationships between two attributes If tuple t has two attribute values xt and Yt it is reasonable to think t follows the Ratio Rule with parameter a b when Yt  axt+b a b C lR This means a Ratio Rule is deemed as a line in 2D space spanned by X and Y Under this definition however only a few tuples strictly follow the same Ratio Rule We also think computational treatment of Ratio Rules is difficult because parameters a b are both arbitrary real numbers For the former problem we set tolerances for both parameters and we assume tuples on a line follow the same Ratio Rule whose parameters vary in the tolerances For the latter problem we use Hough transformation 5 Under Hough transformation Note that attributes X and Y are not symmetric in this formulation The following part denotes a Ratio Rule RR GI p 261 E 0 261 d simply as RRI p 0 C Kinds of Ratio Rules This subsection defines concepts for Ratio Rules to respond to association rule mining for numeric attributes 4 Support for a Ratio Rule RRI\(p 0 means the ratio of tuples following RRI\(p 0 to all tuples and is denoted by support\(RRI\(p 0 Support for I also means the ratio of tuples whose attribute values x included in I to all tuples and is denoted by support\(I Confidence for a Ratio Rule RRI p 0 means the ratio of support\(RRI\(p 0 to support\(I and is denoted by conf RRI p 0  Support and confidence are called minimum support and mimimun confidence respectively when they are given as the minimum thresholds We define the following two kinds of Ratio Rules by the above concepts  Optimized confidence Ratio Rule A Ratio Rule RRI\(p,0 where support\(I fulfills a minimum support and conf RRI p 0 fulfills a minimum confidence and is maximized Here I is called optimized confidence range Optimized support Ratio Rule A Ratio Rule RRI\(p 0 where conf RRI\(p 0 fulfills a minimum confidence and support\(I fulfills a minimum support and is maximized Here I is called optimized support 


Ratio Rule extraction of the range in which the number of tuples following a Ratio Rule is maximized III PROPOSED METHOD This section proposes a method of extracting the optimized confidence/support Ratio Rules mentioned in Section II A Basic Algorithm When we extract optimized confidence/support Ratio Rules the first problem is how optimized confidence/support range is extracted If we judge whether each tuple follows the Ratio Rule RR[o,1 p 0 the problem is assumed as ID numeric association rule mining 4 for the parameter tuple p 0 For a numeric attribute X it is called ID numeric association rule and denoted by X C I  C if X satisfies X C I then a condition C is satisfied where I  s t min\(x  s  t  max\(x This concept is applicable to our problem of setting condition C as whether a tuple follows the Ratio Rule In this paper we apply a method proposed by Fukuda et al 4 This method can extract an optimized confidence/support range in O\(N time where N is the number of tuples The method assumes input tuples are sorted by the target attribute X and each tuple is judged by whether or not it satisfies the condition Our problem also assumes that input data have been sorted Our basic algorithm is summarized in Figure 3 p and 0 are split to be discrete values where their intervals are 2E and 26 respectively based on the tolerances e and 6 Each discrete value for p 0 is denoted by Pi Oj where 1 R R  37/2  E and j 1 T T 2  E Note that p1  0 and 01 7/2 Fig 3 A basic algorithm to generate Ratio Rules B Problem and Modification of Basic Algorithm The basic algorithm above has two major problems One is that computational complexity is very high because it needs to read all tuples and invoke ID numeric association rule mining for all pi Oj pairs If most tuples do not follow the Ratio Rule there is much waste The other problem is that it may output many of essentially the same Ratio Rules Ratio Rules should be regarded essentially the same if many subsequent tuples are common To solve these two problems we propose putting two phases pruning phase and rule integration phase before and after the extraction of optimized confidence/support range and output of Ratio Rules we call these two functions the rule generation phase as a whole The following subsections explain the pruning and rule integration phases C Pruning Phase When RRI pi Oj satisfies mirnsup and mirnconrf the number of tuples following RRI pi Oj is at least support\(RRI pi Oj support\(I x support\(RRI\(pi Oj I The first term on the right side of the above equation is the support of range I and the second term is the confidence of RRI\(pi Oj Hence the number of tuples following RRI pi Oj should be at least the product of mirnsup and mirnconf We describe this threshold as a Based on this property this phase filters candidate pi Oj pairs So valid pi Oj pairs are obtained by enumerating pi Oj pairs and extracting pi Oj pairs whose counts are greater than or equal to a For each tuple calculating the p value for each Oi i  1  T is done in constant time This phase thus completes in O\(TN time In building the histogram we not only count each pi Oj pair but also record tuples following the pair We do this because judgment as to whether each tuple follows each Ratio Rule is needed Note that when pi Oj pair counting and tuple recording are done at the same time TN entries to record tuples are needed then memory usage becomes huge Thus only pi Oj pair counting should be done first and tuple recording should be done only when the pi Oj count satisfies the threshold a This paper assumes the input data is sorted by attribute X thus each tuple records the order D Rule Integration Phase This phase integrates optimized confidence/support Ratio Rules into a set when Ratio Rules are similar to each other We call the set of integrated Ratio Rules as the Ratio Rule Set For the definition of similarity the Jaccard coefficient is applied The Jaccard coefficient between two Ratio Rules RR1 pi Oj and RRI2 Pk 01 is defined as follows RRI1 pi,0 j A RRI2 Pk 01 RRI Pi S j V RR12 Pk  01 Here RRI pi O means the number of tuples following RR pi Oj The definition is the ratio of the number of tuples following both Ratio Rules to either Ratio Rule If this coefficient exceeds a threshold then RR1 pi O and RR12 Pk 01 are regarded as essentially the same The threshold is represented as minmerge If calculating each Jaccard coefficient naively checking the overlapping tuples finding RR,1 Pi 0j A RRI2 pk Oi  are invoked the same number of times as 502 for each pi Oj pair do for each tuple t do judge whether t follows RR[ol pi Oj end extract optimized confidence/support range I with ID numeric association rule mining if RRI pi Ofj satisfies mirnsup and mirnconrf then output RRI pi Oj end end 


the number of all pairs of tuples following RR,1 Pi 0j or RRI2 pk 01 In the pruning phase however tuples following each Ratio Rule are recorded in the order of attribute X Hence to read tuples in recorded order and check overlap immediately overlap checking is invoked only at the same timing as the number of tuples following RR1 pi Oj or RRIj Pk 01 E Summary of Proposed Method Our target is not only to extract each optimized confidence/support Ratio Rule but to obtain optimized confidence/support Ratio Rule Sets Our proposed method to obtain Ratio Rule Sets consists of three phases pruning rule generation and rule integration Assume the number of all tuples is N the number of distinct parameter values for p 0 are R T respectively the number of p 0 pairs qualified by the pruning phase is P  RT the number of optimized confidence/support Ratio Rules satisfying mirnsup and minconf is Q  P Here computational complexity for each phase is O\(TN O\(PN O\(Q2N respectively Our method achieves linear processing time for the data size N while values of T P Q change by parameters c 6 nmirnsup and mirnconrf IV EXPERIMENTS This section evaluates two issues the appropriateness and properties of the proposed method We use two synthetic data and two real datasets Both real datasets are obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 6 The following experimentation used an algorithm implemented in C language The experiments for properties ran on a system with two Pentium III Xeon 1.0GHz CPUs and 2.0GB of main memory A Overview of Dataset A.1 Synthetic Data To generate synthetic data we assume a case in which there are p Ratio Rules and for each Ratio Rule q tuples follow We also assume no tuple follows more than one Ratio Rule so the number of all tuples is pq Ratio Rules and tuples following a Ratio Rule are generated as follows 1 Generate parameters p 0 and range I  Xmin Xmax at random 2 Generate attribute value xi 1  i  q so as to distribute uniformly in I 3 Calculate yi to be yi  p xi cos 0 sin 0 4 Add noise to yi Here noise comprises values following a normal distribution where mean is 0 and variance is 0.1 5 Normalize X and Y to be their ranges 0 1 Parameters P 0 Omin and Xmax are generated to satisfy 0  p  1 7/2  0  7,,0  Xmin  xmax  I and are distributed uniformly in each domain A.2 Abalone Dataset This dataset records measurement results for an individual abalone including nine attributes In this experiment we show Length and Shell weight attributes in seven continuous value type attributes There are 4177 tuples A.3 Wine Recognition Dataset This dataset records chemical analysis results of wines derived from three different cultivars This data includes 13 continuous attributes but we adopt Flavanoids and Proline attributes There are 178 tuples B Evaluation for Appropriateness We first evaluate whether our proposed method extracts appropriate results from each dataset Extracted optimized confidence Ratio Rules and optimized support Ratio Rules are similar except for their ranges Thus we show only optimized confidence Ratio Rules in this paper To generate the synthetic data we make parameters p q  2 500 and 5 2000 The former data is same as that in Figure 2 in Section I Figure 4 shows synthetic data when p q  2 500 and all Ratio Rule Sets extracted In the figure a black point indicates each tuple and a gray area means that tuples follow some extracted Ratio Rule Set Difference of the gray scale represents different Ratio Rule Sets The result is produced when e  0.05 d  0.03 mirnsup 0.25 mirnconf 0.85 and minmerge  0.5 For these parameters 88 p 0 pairs in all 1200 pairs remained after the pruning phase and final output was three optimized conficence Ratio Rule Sets Two Ratio Rule Sets appear in both ends where only one linear relationship stands Another Ratio Rule Set appears where two linear relationships cross Since the crossing part seems to have a linear relationship all results are adequate for optimized confidence Ratio Rule Sets Figure 5 shows another synthetic data p q  5 2000 and extracted all Ratio Rule Sets The result is produced when e  0.01 d  0.05 mirnsup 0.2 mirnconf 0.4 and minmerge  0.5 For these parameters only 637 p 0 pairs in all 33,984 pairs remained after the pruning phase We obtained four Ratio Rule Sets The results show that extracted Ratio Rules Sets do not merely express distributions of tuples but express areas where tuples are dense for the X attribute It means confidence in the area is high thus our proposed method takes into account the support and confidence factors Figure 6 shows a result for the abalone dataset The horizontal axis in the figure plots the normalized value for the attribute Length and the vertical axis plots the normalized value for the attribute Shell weight Black points and gray areas are the same as the results for synthetic data Parameters are given to be e  0.008 d  0.04 mitnsup  0.6 mirnconf 0.7 and minmerge  0.5 After the pruning phase 26 p 0 pairs in all 5340 pairs remained and finally only one Ratio Rule Set is obtained In this dataset distributions in the two areas Length  0.5 and Length  0.5 differ Our method however extracted only one Ratio Rule Set so as to fit the distributions Figure 7 shows a result for the wine recognition dataset The horizontal axis plots Flavanoids and the vertical axis 503

ear The speedup is 1.65 for the 2-node system indicating some degree of parallelization overhead mainly due to the interprocess communication to exchange the support count information The speedup is 3.76 for the 4-node system but the increasing rate of the speedup is 2.27 as the number of nodes is doubled from 2 to 4 As the number of nodes is doubled from 4 to 8 the increasing rate of the speedup is higher than linear again which indicates that PMIHP is quite scalable Number of Processors Time \(seconds 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 1 2 4 8 Figure 6 Total execution time of PMIHP to nd frequent 3-itemsets in 1,427 documents minsup  0.15 Number of Processors Speedup    0 2 4 6 8 2 4 8 Figure 7 Speedup of PMIHP minsup  0.15 The PMIHP algorithm has two main data mining activities counting the support of local candidate itemsets in the corresponding local database and counting the support of global candidate itemsets in multiple local databases These two activities are interleaved during the mining as the global support counting is invoked when the number of identiﬁed global candidate itemsets exceeds a certain number at each processing node which was set to 20,000 in our experiments To measure this global support counting time we reconﬁgured PMIHP to defer the global support counting of the global candidate itemsets at each node and synchronized the nodes before the start of the global support counting phase Figure 8 shows the global support counting time of the mining process with the logest run time among all the mining processes executed on different processing nodes Moreover we used the wall clock time to measure this global counting time hence it is an upper bound of the actual global support counting time of all the mining processes Comparing Figures 6 and 8 we can see that the 2-node case has a much longer global support counting phase than 4-node and 8-node cases The portion of the global support counting phase for the 2-node case is about 8 of the total execution time but it is about 4 for the 4-node case and about 3 for the 8-node case Thus the impact of the global support counting time on the overall speedup is very small and it is reduced further as the number of processing nodes increases Number of Processors Time \(seconds 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 2 4 8 Figure 8 Global support counting time to nd frequent 3-itemsets Since our processing environment does not provide the statistics for job accounting exact CPU time measurement was not feasible So we measured the average execution of a processing node using the wall clock time Figure 9 shows the average execution time of a node in the 1-node 2-node 4-node and 8-node conﬁgurations We can see that the 2-node case requires signiﬁcantly less average execution time per node than the 1-node case and as the number of processing nodes increases further the average execution time per node deceases more than linearly This result is completely consistent with the observed speedup values and also indicates that increased efﬁciency is behind the performance gain Since the identical PMIHP algorithm was executed on all of our system conﬁgurations the differences in execution time must be associated with some workload differences Figure 10 shows the average number of candidate 0-7695-2132-0/04/$17.00 \(C Proceedings of the 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium \(IPDPSê04

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
