2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics October 8-11 2006 Taipei Taiwan Incremental Maintenance of Generalized Multi-supported Association Rules under Transaction Update and Taxonomy Evolution Ming-Cheng Tseng Wen-Yang Lin and Rong Jeng Abstract Mining generalized association rules has been recognized as a very important topic in data mining Earlier work on mining generalized association rules ignores the fact that the taxonomy of items would be changed while new transactions are continuously added into the database In our previous paper we have proposed a method to solve this problem with uniform minimum support however a 
uniform minimum support assumption would obstruct the discovery of associations on some high value or new items that are more interesting but much less supported than general trends In this paper we examine this problem and propose a novel algorithm called MMA_ITTE which can incrementally update the discovered generalized association rules with multiple minimum supports when the taxonomy of items is evolved with incremental transactions Experimental results show that our algorithm can maintain its performance even in large amounts of incremental transactions and high degree of taxonomy evolution and is faster 
than applying the contemporary generalized association mining algorithms to the whole updated database I INTRODUCTION M ining association rules from large databases of business data such as transaction records is a popular topic in the area of data mining 1][2 An association rule is an expression of the form X Y where Xand Yare sets of items Such a rule reveals that transactions in the database containing items in Xtend to also contain items in Y and the probability measured as the fraction of transactions that contain X also contain Y is called the confidence 
of the rule The support of the rule is the fraction of the transactions that contain all items in both X and Y The problem of mining association rules is to discover all association rules that satisfy support and confidence constraints In many applications there are explicit or implicit taxonomy over the items so it may be more useful to find associations at different levels of the taxonomy than only at the primitive concept level 8][15 For example consider the taxonomy of items in Fig 1 it is likely that the association rule Ming-Cheng Tseng

1 Example of taxonomy Previous work on mining generalized association rules assumed that the taxonomy are static ignoring the fact that the taxonomy may change as time passes while new transactions are continuously added into the original database In our previous study we have proposed a method to solve this problem with the uniform support constraint However a uniform support constraint would hinder the discovery of associations on some high value or new items that are very useful information but much less supported Under these circumstances 
V Fig 
how to discover the generalized association rules with multiple minimum supports under incremental transactions and taxonomy evolution effectively becomes a critical task In this paper we examine this problem and propose an algorithm called MMA ITTE Maintenance of generalized Multi-supported Association rules under Incremental Transactions and Taxonomy Evolution which reuses frequent itemsets and is capable of effectively reducing the number of candidate sets and database rescanning and so can update the generalized association rules efficiently Experimental results show that our algorithm is faster than applying the contemporary generalized association mining algorithms to 
the whole updated database The remaining of this paper is organized as follows We discuss previous work in Section 2 and describe the problem in Section 3 In Section 4 we propose MMA ITTE algorithm and give an example in Section 5 In Section 6 we evaluate the performance of the proposed MMA_ITTE algorithm Finally we conclude the work of this paper in Section 7 II PREVIOUS WORK The problem of updating association rules incrementally was first addressed by Cheung et al 4 whose work was 1-4244-0100-3/06/$20.00 2512006 IEEE 2142 


TP HP LaserJet Systemax V N HP later be extended to incorporate the situations of deletion and modification 6 Since then a number of techniques have been proposed to improve the efficiency of incremental mining algorithm 9][11][14][16 But all of them were confined to mining associations among primitive items The problem of mining association rules in the presence of taxonomy information was first introduced in 8 and 15 independently Cheung et al 5 were the first to consider the problem of maintaining generalized multi-level association rules Another form of association rule model with multiple minimum supports was proposed in 10 Their method allowed users to specify different minimum supports to different items and could find rules involving both frequent and rare items However their model considers no taxonomy at all and hence fails to find generalized association rules We then extended this problem model to that of incorporated the taxonomy of items 17 In 7 Han and Fu explored the refinement of concept hierarchies for knowledge discovery in databases and proposed an approach for dynamic generation In  18 Tseng and Lin proposed an approach for the maintenance of generalized association rules under transaction update and taxonomy revolution with a uniform support constraint III PROBLEM STATEMENT A Problem Description Consider the situation when new transactions in db are added to DB and the taxonomy T is changed into a new one T Let ED  and ed denote the extended version of the original database DB and incremental database db respectively by adding the generalized items in T to each transaction Further let UE be the updated extended database containing ED and ed i.e UE  ED  ed The problem of updating LED when new transactions db are added to DB and Tis changed into T is equivalent to finding the set of frequent itemsets in UE denoted as LUE For illustration of our proposed approaches consider the original database with item taxonomy in Fig 2 Suppose that primitive item Sony VAIO and generalized item PC are deleted from the PC group and new primitive item Gateway GE  is inserted into its top generalized item MC Fig 3 shows the new item taxonomy and an incremental database to be updated to the original database B Situations for Taxonomy Evolution According to our observation 18 there are four basic types of item updates that will cause taxonomy evolution item insertion item deletion item renaming and item reclassification Type 1 Item Insertion The strategies to handle this type of update operation are different depending on whether an inserted item is primitive or generalized When the new inserted item is primitive we do not have to process it until an incremental database update containing that item indeed occurs This is because the new item does not appear in the original database neither in the discovered associations However if the new item is a generalization then the insertion will affect the discovered associations since a new generalization often incurs some item reclassification 37 PC 25 PDA HIP LaserJet 40   22 Desktop TP HP 1 Systemax V 2 IBM PC IBM TP MITAC LaserJet 6 Systemax V 7 HP LaserJet 8 HP LaserJet Fig 2 MITAC Mio ACER 20 Original Database DB  I 4 Sony VAIO IBM TP 5 IBM Example of original database DB with old item taxonomy 22 Desktop PC Gateway GE Systemax V 10 20 30 MC HP LaserJet 40 IBM TP PDA 25   20   15 MITAC Mio ACERN 15 Incremental Database  db TID Items Purchased 9 Gateway GE HP LaserJet 10 HP LaserJet Fig 3 Example of incremental database db with new item taxonomy Type 2 Item Deletion Unlike the case of item insertion the deletion of a primitive item from the taxonomy would incur inconsistence problem In other words if there is no transaction update to delete the occurrence of that item then the refined item taxonomy will not conform to the updated database To simplify the problem we assume that outdated items will not be of interest and the update of the taxonomy is always consistent with the transaction update to the database Additionally the removal of a generalization may also lead to item reclassification So we always have to deal with the situation caused by item deletion Type 3 Item Renaming When items are renamed we do not have to process the database we just replace the frequent itemsets with new names Type 4 Item Reclassification This is the most profound operation among the four types of taxonomy evolutions Once an item primitive or generalized is reclassified into another category all of its generalized items in the old and new taxonomy are affected 2143 TID Items Purchased Mio ACER N 20 15 15    ms 15 Sony VAIO Systemax V LaserJet 3 


IV THE PROPOSED METHOD A Algorithm Basics In order to find generalized multi-supported association rules now we introduce the following notation to facilitate the discussion I J denote the set of primitive items and the set of generalized items in T respectively and I J represent the counterparts in T Definition 1 Let ms\(a denote the minimum support of an item a in I u J An itemset A  al a2  ak where a Ea I u J is frequent if the support of A is larger than or equal to the lowest value of minimum support of items in A i.e sup\(A  min ai EA MS\(ai Therefore the frequent itemset must be no less than the lowest value of minimum support of items in the itemset In T we use I u J instead of I u J to generate association rules Let a k-itemset denote an itemset with k items The basic process of our mining multi-supported association rules under incremental transaction update and taxonomy evolution follows the level-wise approach used by most Apriori-like algorithms However the well-known Apriori pruning technique based on the concept of downward closure does not work for multiple support specification To solve this problem we have adopted the sorted closure property 10 in our previous work for maintenance of generalized association rules with multiple minimum supports 17 Hereafter to distinguish from the traditional itemset a sorted k-itemset denoted as a a2  ak is used Lemma 1 If a sorted k-itemset a a2  ak fork 2 and ms\(al  ms\(a2    ms\(ak is frequent then all of its sorted subsets with k-1 items are frequent except the subset a2 a3  ak Lemma 2 For k  2 the procedure apriori-gen\(LI fails to generate all candidate 2-itemsets in C2 Therefore generating all candidate 2-itemsets C2 is from the frontier set F  17 Lemma 3 For k  3 any k-itemset A  a a2  ak generated by procedure apriori-gen\(Lk-1 can be pruned if there exists one k-1 subset of A say aj1 ai2  aik_l such that ai ai2  aik I o Lk1 and ail  a or ms\(ail  ms\(ai2 For more details please refer to 17 In mining generalized association rules a straightforward method to update the discovered generalized frequent itemsets would be to run any of the algorithms for finding generalized frequent itemsets such as MMS Cumulate and MMS_Stratify 17 on the updated extended database UE This simple way however does not utilize the discovered frequent itemsets and ignores the fact that scanning the whole updated database would be avoided Instead a better approach is to within the set of discovered frequent itemsets LED differentiate the itemsets that are unaffected with respect to the taxonomy evolution from the others and then utilize them to avoid unnecessary computation in the course of incremental update To this end we first have to identify the unaffected items whose supports does not change with respect to the taxonomy evolution and then use them to identify the unaffected itemsets Definition 2 An item in T is called an unaffected item if its support does not change with respect to the taxonomy evolution Lemma 4 Consider a primitive item a in TUT Then a countED*\(a  countED\(a if a a I rnJ and b countED*\(a  0 if a I*I where countED*\(a and countED\(a denote the support count of item a in ED  and ED respectively Lemma 5 Consider a generalized item g in Th Then countED*\(g  countED\(g if desr*\(g  des7g where desT*\(g and des1g denote the sets of descendant primitive items of g in T and T respectively In summary Lemmas 4 and 5 state that an item is unaffected by the taxonomy evolution if it is a primitive item before and after the taxonomy evolution or it is a generalized item whose descendant set of primitive items remains the same Definition 3 An itemset A in ED is called an unaffected itemset if its support does not change with respect to the taxonomy evolution Lemma 6 Consider an itemset A in ED Then a countED*\(A  countED\(A if A contains unaffected items only b countuE*\(A  0 if A contains at least one item a for a GI 1 Now that we have clarified how to identify the unaffected itemsets we will further show how to utilize this information to alleviate the overhead in updating the supports of itemsets Consider a candidate itemset A generated during the mining process We observe that there are five different cases for the support count of A in the whole updated database UE 1 If A is an unaffected itemset and is frequent in ED and ed then it is also frequent in the updated extended database UE 2 If A is an unaffected itemset and is infrequent in ED and ed then it is also infrequent in UE 3 If A is an unaffected itemset and is in ED but infrequent in ed then a simple calculation can determine whether A is frequent or not in UE 4 If A is an unaffected infrequent itemset in ED but is frequent in ed then it is an undetermined itemset in UE i.e it may be either frequent or infrequent 5 If A is an affected frequent itemset and is frequent or infrequent in both ED and ed then it is an undetermined itemset in UE These five cases are summarized in Table 1 Note that only Cases 4 and 5 require an additional scan of ED to determine the support count of A in UE In Case 4 after scanning ed and comparing with ms\(A[1 where ms\(A[1 denotes the smallest ms\(ai in ai eA ifA is frequent in ed A may become frequent in UE Then we need to rescan ED to determine 2144 


infreq no 2 affected the support counts of A For Case 5 since A is an affected itemset its support count could be changed in ED  Therefore we need to further scan ED to decide whether it is frequent or not For Cases 1 to 3 there is no need to further scan ED to determine the support count of an itemset A That is we have utilized the information of unaffected itemsets and discovered frequent itemsets to avoid such a database scan Furthermore the identification of itemsets satisfying Case 2 provides another opportunity for candidate pruning TABLE infreq  scan ED 5 Input 1 DB original database 2 db incremental database 3 ms multiple minimum support setting 4 T old item taxonomy 5 T new item taxonomy 6 LD set of original frequent itemsets Output LUE set of new frequent itemsets with respect to T and ed Steps 1 Identify affected items 2 3 unaffected _____ ______________ freq  scan ED 4 1 FIVE CASES 4  5  16 Calculate countuE A  countED A  counted A for each itemset A in Ck 17 LLk A I A eCk and sup UE A ms\(A 18 until Lk 0 19 LUE  Uk LE Fig 4 Algorithm MMA_ITTE V AN EXAMPLE OF MMA ITTE ALGORITHM Consider the example in Fig 2 and 3 To simplify the illustration we use item A to stand for PC B for Desktop PC C for Sony VAIO D for IBM TP E for Systemax V F for PDA G for MITAC Mio H for ACER N I for HP LaserJet J for MC and K for Gateway GE  in the item taxonomy The resulting figure is shown in Fig 5 First let candidate 1 itemsets Cl be the set of items in the new item taxonomy T i.e all items in T are candidate 1 itemsets Second load the original frequent 1-itemsets LED and divide C1 into three subsets Cx Cy and Cz where Cx D E I Cy F G H and Cz B K J Next scan ed for Cl and scan ED  for Cy and Cz Calculate the support count of each 1 itemset in C1 and generate the frontier set F  K G H D E B F J 1 After comparing the supports of each 1 itemset with the corresponding ms the set of new frequent 1-itemsets LIJE is B D E I J K After generating LuE  we use the frontier set F to generate candidate 2-itemsets C2 obtaining C2  KG KH KD KE KF KJ KI DE DB DI EJ El BJ BI JI After loading the original frequent 2-itemsets L4ED  divide C2 into 2145 k 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 repeat if k 1 then generate Cl from T else if k 2 then generate C2 from the frontier set F else Ck apriori-gen Lk-E  Delete any candidate in Ck that consists of an item and its ancestor Load original frequent k-itemsets LED k Divide Ck into three subsets Cx Cy and Cz for each A E Cx do  Cases I  3  Assign countED A COUn,tEO\(A Scan ed to count count ed A for each itemset A in Ck Led A IAcCk and sup d A  ms\(A[l B Algorithm MMA_ITTE Based on the aforementioned concepts we propose an algorithm called MMA ITTE to accomplish this task The main process of the algorithm is presented as follows First let candidate 1-itemsets Cl be the set of items in the new item taxonomy T i.e all items in T are candidate 1-itemsets Next we identify the affected items Then load the original frequent 1-itemsets L ED and divide C1 into three independent subsets Cx Cy and Cz where Cx consists of unaffected k-itemsets in LED and Cy comprises unaffected k-itemsets not in LED and Cz contains affected k itemsets Cx is used for Cases 1 and 3 Cy for Cases 2 and 4 and Cz for Case 5 Next scan ed to get the support counts of itemsets in C1 For each 1 itemset in Cx accumulate its support count in ed and ED and compare supports of those 1 itemsets satisfying with Case 3 with ms and get frequent 1 itemsets for LijE For the set Cy only frequent 1 itemsets in ed need to rescan ED  due to Case 4 and after getting the support counts in ED accumulate the support counts for each 1-itemset in ed and ED  compare each 1 itemset supports with ms\(A  1  and get frequent 1 itemsets for LuE  For Cz scan ed and ED compare its support of each 1-itemset with ms\(A[1 and get frequent 1-itemsets for LJE After getting all frequent 1-itemsets in UE the algorithm continues to generate candidate 2-itemsets C2 from the frontier set F and invokes to generate for candidate k-itemsets Ck from LuE for k  3 and processes the same procedure for generating LluE until no frequent k-itemsets LuE is created The MMA ITTE algorithm is shown in Fig 4 14Delete any candidate A from Cy if A X Ltd  Case 2  15 Scan ED  to count countED A for each itemset A in Cy and Cz  Cases ARISING FROM THE UPDATED EXTENDED INCREMENTAL DATABASE AND TAXONOMY EVOLUTION T ed UE Action Case freq freq no 1 infreq  compare sup uE*\(A with ms\(A 1 infreq E S freq T LED

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than ìbest î in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a ìbest ?rstî case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
