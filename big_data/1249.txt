This paper put forward an algorithm of pattern encoding, which can e x p m  patterns in digits, thus the intrusion pattern can he detected efficiently. At the m e  time, it also has proved that the patterns detection methods based on pattern encoding are eqnal to the methods with similarity theory, as a result, any intrusion pattern detection algorithms based on similarity theory can he realized by pattern encoding Keywords pattern encoding; intrusion detection 1. Introduction Association NI= encoding; fquent  episodes encoding Data Mining can pick up the pattern, which is connotative, unknown beforehand and useful for decision-making, from the data in large-scale database or data warehouse. This technique has already been availably applied to IDSs. Both association rules algorithm and sequential patterns algorithm can mine the pattern of association rules , frequent episode  Because NIDSs have to deal with a large quantity of communication data, the pattern set we mined is very huge. Usually people use expert system and decision treef2  to compare mined patterns and detect intrusion, but all these techniques are based on pattern matching. Actually, they dont  t work tine because the huge quantity of pattern to be matched, which cause the efficiency of IDS very low and decrease the characteristic of real-time and This paper puts forward a digital detection method for intrusion pattern fmt, we encode the association rules and frequent episodes conver each association rule or frequent episode to a number; Then using simple mathematization to compare pattern, we can detect intrusion effectively. In this paper we also proved that encoding scheme is equivalent to the detection method based on comparability theory. Thus we can use encoding scheme to realize every algorithm that is realized by comparability theory 2. Association rules encoding 2.1. Concepts Definition  Complete and ordered  association Assuming associations have n attributes, we call an association\(A1 = VI; A2 = v2; ::;Ak = vk  complete and ordered  if k = n and a*hutes AI: A2: ...... ;Ak are in some user-defined decreasing  order of importance   Definition 2: the way of converting an association rule to its  complete and ordered  form: in case of k&lt;n, if Ai is missing, then we insert Ai=null in the association rule and sort the attributes in the order of importance Definition 3: attribute-value table of the association rules: It is a table, defined by users, the field name of which stands for the order of importance of the corresponding attribute decreasing from left to right. Records in the table are the possible values of the corresponding attribute, stored fmm left to right in order of importance 2.2. Encoding ideas Many attributes in association rules of intrusion detection are Categorical Amibutes, however, Categorical Attributes are discrete and not ordered. Some attributes are numeric, but the range of their values is too large for encoding, therefore we developed a attribute-value table of amp;sociation rules, sorting the attributes in order. of importance in the way of descending and y-direction, while sorting values of attributes in order of importance in the way of descending and x-direction. In $is way, association 


way of descending and x-direction. In $is way, association attributes and their values can be effectively converted to digits according to their order in the table, and then we can encode any association rule according to the table What deserve taking a look is that sorting the attributes of association rules and their values in order of importance should be based on huge amounts of statistical results running on network and reasonable analyses. This kind of sorting will finally have a great influence on the effect of intrusion detection using model comparison 0-7803-8403-2/04/$20.00 WOO4 IEEE 1293 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybemetics, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 23. Asooeiation encoding algorithm named from right to left as 1,2,3,4 ,..., m. The association rules attribute-value table is as follows Before encoding association rules, we should conshuct the attribute-value table of association rules. The fmt column in the table is taken by each attribute's max count of iti value, while in other columns the values of attributes are stored in order of importance and each field name is Figure 1. frame of association rules attribute-value table As for any given association rule, we can compute its encoding as follows Step 1: convert association rules to their "complete and ordered" form Step 2 according to the attribute-value table, convert each association rule \(Aj=vj, A2=vz, ..., A sequence of digits evlea ... em. If vi is null, then the Corresponding e6 is 0, and then do the encoding To unify the encoding representation i d f o r  the convenience of encoding process, we use a digits to present all the attributes values \(regardless of their max values can be got through the first column in association rules attribute-value table: \(the max count of each attributes values is stored here max=maximum\(maxcount[i] I i=1,2, ..., n a=Integer-up\(log,dml I * Integer-up is up integer function * I Rules-Encoding algorithm is as follows Universal variants attribute-values[n][m]; I* the nxm association rules attribute-value table:, attribute-values[i]fil stands for the j-th value of attribute Ai codes association rule X *I tempccdes[n attribute value vi of attribute Ai codes are the fmal codes of I* tempcodes[n] store code of order-number importance order of the value of attribute Ai from table of attribute-value Begin 1 ordered" form 2 Ai= v a function which can get the convert the association rule X to "complete and if vj is null /* no such attribute value tempcodes[i] = 0 else tempcodes[i] =order-number\(Ai=vj get the corresponding sequence number of the attribute from the attribute-value table I* encode and compute *I 3 for i=l to n codes=codes ftempcodes[i]x\( 10 I* add all attribute in the form of digital End Figure 1 Rules-Encoding algorithm

The attributes of an association rule is n at the most, and therefore the time complexity of association rule encoding algorithm is O\(nxm 3.

In the same way, we define those patterns which have the same difference of code get the same sorting number in Q2 Thus, as long as the sorting numbers are the same we consider the relative order consistent Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Leaming and Cybernetics, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 5. Intrusion patterns detection algorithm According to the relationship between pattem code and pattem similarity indicated in the 5 theorems in the last section, we can recognize the similarity degree of the two patterns by the difference between the pattems codes. Using E which is the value deviating from user-defined pattern we can make sure whether the similarity between a pattern 


we can make sure whether the similarity between a pattern and the standard pattern is in reasonable range, thus we can detect intrusions As for standard pattems set P, we can use the encoding algorithm to compute each pattem code at one time, let the codes set to be Ep. As for any pattern PI, we can develop the following algorithm to check whether it is intrusion pattem Begin 1 2 3 standard pattern set is compared with %,,code of pattern pl,and select the minimum begin diffp = I 5, -e I if diff, &lt; min I * the absolute difference between %I and e then min = diff end 4 End 6.

Experimental Results We investigated our approach against 19 different datasets from [20] as well as a different datasets for forecasting the behaviour of an optimisation heuristic within a hyperheuristic framework [5, 16]. Stratified tenfold cross-validation was used to derive the classifiers and error rates in the experiments. Cross-validation is a standard evaluation measure for calculating error rate on data in machine learning. Three popular classification techniques a decision tree rule \(PART CBA have been compared to MMAC in terms of classification accuracy, in order to evaluate the predictive power of the proposed method The choice of such learning methods is based on the different strategies they use to generate the rules. Since the chosen techniques are only suitable for traditional classification problems where there is only one class assigned to each training instance, we therefore used classification accuracy derived by only the top-label evaluation measure for fair comparison All experiments were conducted on a Pentium IV 1.6 GH PC.  The experiments of PART and RIPPER were conducted using the Weka software system [20]. Weka stands for Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. It is an open java source code for the machine teaching community that includes implementations of different methods for several different data mining tasks such as classification, clustering, association rule and regression. CBA experiments were conducted using a VC++ implementation version provided by [19]. Finally MMAC was implemented using Java We have evaluated 19 selected datasets from Weka data collection [20], in which, a few of them \(6 reduced by ignoring their integer and/or real attributes Several tests using ten-fold cross-validation have been performed to ensure that the removal of any real/integer attributes from some of the datasets does not significantly affect the classification accuracy. To do so we only considered datasets where the error rate was not more than 6% worse than the error rate obtained on the same dataset before the removal of any real/integer attributes.  Thus, the ignored attributes do not impact on the error rate too significantly Many studies have shown that the support threshold plays a major role in the overall classification accuracy of the set of rules produced by existing associative classification techniques [9, 12]. Moreover, the support value has a larger impact on the number of rules produced in the classifier and the processing time and storage needed during the algorithm rules discovery and generation. From our experiments, we noticed that the support rates that ranged between 2% to 5% usually achieve the best balance between accuracy rates and the size of the resulted classifiers. Moreover, the classifiers derived when the support was set to 2% and 3 achieved high accuracy, and most often better than that of decision trees rule \(PART the MinSupp was set to 3% in the experiments. The confidence threshold, on the other hand, is less complex and does not have a large effect on the behaviour of any associative classification method as support value, and thus it has been set to 30

Classifier sizes of MMAC \(toplabel the scheduling   data collection. The accuracy of MMAC has been derived using the top-label evaluation measure. Our algorithm outperforms the rule learning methods in terms of accuracy rate, and the won-loss-tied records of MMAC against PART, RIPPER and CBA 13-6-0, 15-4-0 and 154-0, respectively The evaluation measures of MMAC have been compared on 9 solution runs produced by the Peckish hyperheuristic [5] with regard to accuracy, and number of rules produced. Figures 3a and 3b represent the relative prediction accuracy that indicates the difference of the classification accuracy of MMAC evaluation measures with respect to those derived by CBA and PART, respectively. In other words, how much better or worse MMAC measures perform with respect to CBA and PART learning methods. The relative prediction accuracy numbers shown in Figures 3a and 3b are conducted using the formula PART PARTMMAC Accuracy AccuracyAccuracy  and CBA CBAMMAC Accuracy AccuracyAccuracy  respectively. After analysing the charts, we found out that there is consistency between the top-label and label-weight measures, since both of them consider only one class in the prediction. The top-label takes into account the topranked class, and the label-weight considers only the weight for the predicted class that matches the test case Thus, both of these evaluation measures are applicable to traditional single-class classification problems. On the other hand, the any-label measure considers any class in the set of the predicted classes as a hit whenever it matches the predicted class regardless of its weight or rank. Is should be noted that, the relative accuracy of MMAC evaluation methods against dataset number 8 in Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART 


Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART achieved a higher classification rate against this particular dataset A comparison of the knowledge representation produced by our method, PART and CBA has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the set of rules derived. Figure 4 represents the classifiers generated form the hyperheuristic datasets. Analysis of the rules sets indicated that MMAC derives a few more rules than PART and CBA for the majority of the datasets. In particular, the proposed method produced more rules than PART and CBA on 8 and 7 datasets, respectively. A possible reason for extracting more rules is based on the recursive learning phase that MMAC employs to discover more hidden information that most of the associative classification techniques discard, since they only extract the highest confidence rule for each frequent item that survives MinConf Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 6. Conclusions A new approach for multi-class, and multi-label classification has been proposed that has many distinguishing features over traditional and associative classification methods in that it \(1 that contain rules with multiple labels, \(2 evaluation measures for evaluating accuracy rate, \(3 employs a new method of discovering the rules that require only one scan over the training data, \(4 introduces a ranking technique which prunes redundant rules, and ensures only high effective ones are used for classification, and \(5 discovery and rules generation in one phase to conserve less storage and runtime. Performance studies on 19 datasets from Weka data collection and 9 hyperheuristic scheduling runs indicated that our proposed approach is effective, consistent and has a higher classification rate than the-state-of-the-art decision tree rule \(PART and RIPPER algorithms. In further work, we anticipate extending the method to treat continuous data and creating a hyperheuristic approach to learn  on the fly   which low-level heuristic method is the most effective References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
