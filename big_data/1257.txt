A similar file is produced by the algorithm being tested using the same annotation engine. A matching rule has been established to validate the association between items of the two jiles. For each fi-ame a statistical analyzer extracts the iaumber of mis-detections, both positive and negative, and correct detections. Using these data, statistics about the algorithm behavior are computed with the aim of tuning parameters and pointing out recongiaition weak nesses in particular situations I. INTRODUCTION The detection of human shapes is one of the most active research objective in the field of artificial vision. Various approaches have recently been proposed \(many applications rely on such detectors, like automotive precrash, security and surveillance systems   issue at the basis of the design of a human shape detector is the availability of a tool for performance evaluation Working on real images, because of the intrinsic problem complexity, some kind of external information is necessary in order to validate the algorithm results A system for performance evaluation needs to know the ground truth", this can be obtained using two different ap proaches: recording additional data together with processed images data and using the annotation based approach presented in this paper. The former collects information about the pedestrians position using sensors different from vision, such as radio transmitters. The correctness of the algorithm can be evaluated in realtime but some problems may occur in cases, for example, where a pedestrian is partially occluded but the radio transmitter \(or other anyway sensed by the detector. The other approach, the one dealt with in this paper, relies on a frame by frame manual annotation, by a human operator, of all pedestrians appearing in each frame of a video sequence. This is a post processing operation, thus images must be acquired The research described in this work was sponsored by US Army and saved on a storage device. Subsequently, the images are annotated in laboratory: a human operator, using a GUI, defines the position and size of pedestrians in each frame and produces a file containing the description of all pedestrian in the image sequence. A similar file of the same format is created by the pedestrian detection algorithm which is under test. Finally the two files are compared and statistics are extracted. Parameters and thresholds can be adjusted and their effect on the algorithm behaviour highlighted The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the state of the art in performance evaluation tools for vision algorithms. Section 3 describes the annotation tool composed by: engine, GUI, and performance ana lyzer. In section 4, an evaluation method for algorithms is proposed along with a case study. Finally, the paper is concluded with a discussion describing results about the optimization of the case study and future work 11. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 


11. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION This section describes the state of the art in performance evaluation for vision algorithms and in particular for pedes trian detection Vision applications proved their efficiency and usefulness in many fields but current research practices, and in particu lar system-building techniques, are inadequate especially for fine tuning and filter combination testing. One key aspect of this problem is the inability to conduct adequate perfor mance characterization of new technologies \(like pedestrian detectors of real scenes, sometimes pedestrians are occluded by other obstacles, sometimes parts of framed obstacles looks like pedestrians \(even for humans observers The main purpose of a general approach to Performance Characterization of Computer Vision Systems [ 5 ]  is the statistical testing, tuning, algorithmic combination and al gorithmic re-use in order to improve algorithms reliability and robustness The work presented in [6] uses ground truth automat ically extracted from pseudo synthetic video to perform evaluation of a pedestrian tracker on typical surveillance images taken from a fixed camera. However when dealing with real images taken from moving a cameras installed 0-7803-831 0-9/04/$20.00 0 2004 IEEE 784 on a vehicle, the manual ground-truth generation approach seems to be more robust ViPER \(Video Performance Evaluation Resource scribed in [7] and [8] is a Java integrated tool for authoring ground truth meta-data in image sequences and evaluate performance of algorithms A similar system is proposed in this paper. A key advan tage of this tool is it  s integration in a complete environment for the development of vision algorithms. This simplify design and tuning of parameters allowing to directly check the impact, of their variation, on performances The study presented in [3] points out the importance of a good performance evaluation method for the actual deploy ment of systems on board of vehicles. This study was based on a large number of tests. Results were analyzed using ROC curves to highlight the impact of parameters variations on the algorithm performance in terms of detection rate and false positive rate 111. THE ANNOTATION TOOL A. Description Performance evaluation using the annotation tool takes place in three steps: supervised sequence annotation by a human operator, automatic sequence annotation by the algorithm being tested, annotations comparison and anal ysis. Thanks to a common annotation engine, the tool allows the human operator and the algorithm to extract, into separate files, pedestrian information relative to the same image sequence. Pedestrians are described by means of the bounding boxes \(BBs compared and statistical information about the algorithm behavior are extracted. Each step is described below in detail. The performance evaluation tool structure is shown in figure 1 1 During this step a human operator analyzes every frame of a pre-recorded video sequence. For each frame in the sequence the operator manually draws the BB around the pedestrian using a graphical user interface described in section 111-B. For each BB, the operator also locates the region containing the pedestrian  s head. The head is an important human shape feature that can easily be found. The existence of informations describing heads allows to profile recognition performances of the algorithms that looks for this feature It is also possible to classify the pedestrian as completely visible or partially occluded by an obstacle. This description 


visible or partially occluded by an obstacle. This description of the sequence ground truth is stored in a file named H shown in figure 1. An example reporting a frame during the annotation process is reported in figure 2.a 2 der test: The output of a pedestrian detection algorithm can be described in terms of a list of BBs for each frame Optionally, the algorithm can also produce information regarding the position of the head or some other interesting feature related to the pedestrian If needed an additional block can be added to the algo rithm output stage in order to translate its results in a format compatible with the annotation engine input. For example if an algorithm extracts the human shapes from source images its output can be converted in a list of BBs each one defining the pixel area in the source image occupied by the pedestrian  s shape. The description of the sequence produced by the algorithm is saved in a file named A also shown in figure 1. An example of BB generated by the algorithm under test is reported in figure 2.b 3 last step of the performance evaluation process. It takes as input the two previously created files and compares them frame by frame, extracting statistical information about the algorithm behavior. Three values are calculated for each frame: false positives \(FP FN detections \(CD In order to distinguish if a BB generated by the algorithm represents a correct detection \(CD it to all the BBs annotated by the human operator Two BBs, p and q, of area 2, and 2, respectively, are defined as matching if Z,, W~,/Z,Z, is greater than ZT~, were W,, is the overlapped area between p and q and Z T ~  is a threshold adjustable by the user \(a good value may be Z T ~  = 0.7 This relation embodies the following property: well over lapped BBs generate high values of Z,,, but as the over lapping area decreases linearly, the value of Z,, decreases at higher rate \(square Every frame of the sequence analyzed through a particular algorithm can be modeled with the following two sets H,  A {BBs annotated by a human operator A, I {BBs annotated by the examined algorithm where n is the frame number of a specific video sequence N frames long Let the symbol 1x1 represents the cardinality of X namely the number of elements in the set It is possible to define the matching operator 8 between a BB annotated by the operator and one annotated by the algorithm under testing in this way  let ai E A, and hj  E H Based on this definition  dui E A,  exists at most one j such that ai 8 hj = 1. In fact, given ai, Za,h, &gt; Zth for different values of j .  This ambiguity is resolved by the maz A graphic representation of the matching process result is reported in figure 2.c 785 Video Sequence _---------________ Fig. 1 compared producing statistics about algorithm performance Block diagram of the algorithm: human and algorithm process the same video sequence producing  annotation files 13 and A. The two files are Fig. 2. \(a  selected BB is cyan filled \(il can be resized or moved non-filled green BBs are non selected BB, the yellow one is marked as occluded, the green-filled  one is currently being drawn by the operator.

In this way it is possible to identify frames in which the algorithm works fine and situations related to algorithm weaknesses Now a set of global values is defined referred to the whole sequence in order to compare different algorithms working on that sequence N - 1 These values are sequence specific and measure respec tively: the correct detection rate and the false positive rate F P R  cannot be normalized because false positives have no upper limit B. User Inte8ace The input interface has been designed with the objective of reducing, as much as possible, the workload for frame annotation. An example of the annotation window during the drawing process of a new pedestrian is presented in figures 2.a. In figure 6.b is reported the annotation panel during the annotation process. The key points for reducing the annotation time are the following Similarity between consecutive frumes. Usually a frame in a real-time sequence contains little differences from the previous one. For this reason it can be assumed that a BB containing a pedestrian will have a similar position and size in the subsequent frame, possibly with some little corrections. To remove the need for a complete redrawing of BBs on every frame of a sequence, the GUI copies all BBs of a certain frame to the following one, leaving to the operator the task of adjusting size and position, as well as adding and deleting new and disappeared BBs Easy input method. The interface has been studied keep ing ergonomics in mind: the operator uses one hand to 786 1 CDR 0  Optimum Alg ortit h m Real Cases Worst Cases FPR Fig. 3. Vision based pedestrian detection normalized evaluation space command the mouse and the other one for the keyboard. In this way all important commands such as tracing, resizing and repositioning of BBs are directly available to the user Moreover using the mouse wheel the operator can select the target BB to modify. Some additional keyboard commands allow to speed up common operations such as deleting all BBs in the frame It has been proven that this kind of interface is user friendly. This GUI allows a human operator to annotate about 100 framesh. This number is the average speed obtained from 10 different users who never used the tool before, each annotating 200 frames. However it is reason able to assume this speed will increases with experience. A more accurate drawing of BBs can be obtained magnifying the tracing area IV. ALGORITHMS EVALUATION SPACE 


IV. ALGORITHMS EVALUATION SPACE This section contains some considerations regarding al gorithms evaluation The values C D R  and F P R  introduced in the previous section were referred to a single sequence. Indeed in order to have a more general and robust statistical description of the algorithm these values must be computed on a sufficiently large sequence including a wide variety of different scenarios The 2D space &lt; F P R , C D R  &gt; is defined as shown in figure 3;  the optimal algorithm is placed in the point \(0 , l Namely, all algorithms that do not give any false positive should stay in the segment [O, a] with a E [0,1]. Algorithms with bad performance fall in the right bottom part of the space while real cases fall inside the central area This kind of evaluation allows to determine if an algo rithm modification improves \(even slightly performance. For example this system is useful to fine tune parameters and thresholds. It is possible to evaluate the impact that a parameter modification has on the algorithm performance observing the movement of the point repre senting the algorithm in the evaluation space. Moreover the inclusion of new filters can be evaluated measuring per formance variations. Indeed the time consuming annotation Fig. 5. Statistics extraction screen-shot: for each frame values of CD, Fp FN and human annotated \(in yellow process that requires the human supervision is performed only once for every sequence It is also possible to define a metric \(for example the euclidean distance from the [0,1] point ments, It is necessary to underline that the specific opti mality criterion is strictly dependent on the application. In some applications, such as quality control for example, it may be desirable to avoid false positives and disregard false negatives. In other applications, such as automotive precrash systems, some false positives may be acceptable, even if an excessive number of FP reduces the user confidence in the recognition system. In these two cases the distance from the optimum point should be defined in different ways v. PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The performance evaluation tool described in this paper has been used to evaluate pedestrian detection algorithms. In particular, the algorithm presented in [9] has been chosen as a case study. A number of sequences for nearly 1500 images have been manually annotated. The sequences were taken in different scenarios \(parking lot, open field, and downtown under different illumination and weather conditions, and framed different subjects at different distances. The aim of this step was to create a test set describing many of the the possible cases that the algorithm can deal with. In the test sequence, composed of 1500 images, 1897 human shapes were annotated as completely visible while 361 were marked as partially occluded. Figure 4 shows a number of different situations for the test sequence The overall system performance shows that the correct detection rate is about 83% \(1572/1897=82.9 sensitivity of the algorithm \(83 appreciable false positives rate 0.46 FP per frame. Indeed a set of higher thresholds in the algorithm would decrease the number of false positives, but, at the same time would reduce the correct detection rate. The false negatives rate 426/1897=26.1 rate exceeds 100% \(82.9%+26.1%=109 also includes occasional detections of occluded human shapes The main result of these tests were the statistical charac terization of the detector behaviour and the precise iden tification of particularly challenging segments of a large 787 Side by side pedesviitns Fig. 4.

The program output while extracting statistics from the algorithm is shown in figures 5 and 6.b The presented performance evaluation tool has been proven to be effective though it requires a very expensive annotation process. The time required to annotate one frame is a value than can be reduced only by either modifying the input method \(finding more efficient shortcuts for frequent operations Thus, improvements should be in GUI refining and in automatic resize/reposition of the bounding boxes using motion detection techniques whenever possible. GUI re finement can be done following impressions of user that performs longs annotations. Motion detection techniques such as correlation analysis between frames and optical flow can be used to determine the new coarse position and size of BBs in new frame starting from those in the previous frames. It is necessary to consider that the time 788 spent to perform such detection can  t be too hight in order to maintain the number of annotated framesh comparable with the human one. Relying on an accurate prediction of the new BBs position, operator  s task would be reduced to a mere supervision activity reducing the time spent to annotate each single frame This study shows a tool to detect positive aspects and weakness points of a pedestrian detector working on a given video sequence. The tool can also serve as a performance comparison method between different algorithms The system was implemented using the C language and included in the GOLD software, a framework for vision applications development implemented at the University of Parma REFERENCES I]  M.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
