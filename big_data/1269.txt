When it comes to test mining, a better way is to take the context into account. The association rule, a method gaining increasing currency among scholars, enables multiple classifications of a same set of high frequency words and achieves high performance even with unstructured text data in terms of rehieval eficiency and qlanatory power of the final results. In this paper, the process of text data mining approach will be discussed. A case study from Tzu Chi University in Taiwan will be used to demonshate the implication ofthis approach Keywords: association rule, data mining, text data multiple classifications 1 Introduction A fundamental concern about data mining is to making sense of data by using pre-acquired knowledge Without the knowledge, data remains to he information instead of knowledge. This paper addresses the issue of meaningful" classification of text data. Meaningful, that is, to human users and for machines. Classification rules, if not meaningful to the human users, certainly do not yield much value. The experimental database employed a logic that fits very close to class association rules \(CARS mining, a very important technique gaining increasing currency lately \(Li, Han, and Pei 2001; Liu, Hsu and Ma 1998; Z a h e  and Antonie 2001, 2002 stories gathered from journals and newspapers as raw material, uncovered associations needed, and used these associations to apply to classification tasks. Finally, we queried the database and generated very meaningful 3-D graphs that even end users without specific knowledge of data mining may quickly grasp the meanings of the graphs 2 Text Mining Application Associating Identities with Projected Actions There are three steps for using the text data mining approach in this study, which are [ I ]  data pre-processing 2] data selection, and [3] data mining. For the purpose of illustrating the text data mining approach, the following three sections detail the processes and use the case study for demonstration. The data is collected from two official Tzu Chi Journals, United Daily and China Times. We then extract events from those materials. Every event involves a number of named entities, which belong in different semantic classes, and some relationships that hold among these named entities 2.1 Data Pre-processing Data cleaning: we hypothesized that members of Tzu Chi had been well indoctrinated through their routine interaction within group meetings. That enables them to cany out emergency relief tasks collectively without the need or presence of a well-organized bureaucratic structure. Based on this hypothesis, we try to locate different patterns of association among various identities and projected actions related to different clusters of 


projected actions related to different clusters of Tzu Chi members. Therefore, the preprocessing task was to identify all the nouns within those sentences, which are the units of analysis, wherein anything related to Tzu-chi was identified. While retaining all the original documents in the database, we selected, numbered, and stored these sentences as database entities Data Integration: next, we look at those sentences and try to locate all the verbs, where there are within the same sentence. It should he noted that semantic inferences is not our concern here Rather, we are trying to locate association and/or correlations between nouns, verbs, and their relationships, known or unknown previously. The verbs were subsequently categorized, using lexicon knowledge, into nine categories Data selection, transformation and reduction 2.2 Relational database design: an E R  model was 0-7803-81 93-9/04/$17.00 02004 IEEE 243 developed to offer a unified view of text data Extracted features within those sentences are defined to different entities. Relationships are built up with the associations among these entities We use MS SQL Server as the relational database management and analysis system. \(see EIR Model in the Appendix Attributes and constrains definition: define all attributes on entities to show the information associated with each feature in a data layer. In addition, we also constrain database values to the valid ranges as defmed by the thematic rules Normalization: use 4NF \(see Ghosh 1991 organize the contents of the tables for transactional databases to prevent update anomalies and data inconsistencies and to deal with multi-valued facts 2.3 Data Mining Time sequence analysis: show the overall pattern of the nouns and verbs in terms of frequency appearances. Further, to generate an interactive timeline displaying the major identities and projected actions covered by the corpus Statistical analyses are sample-specific. By drawing statistical inferences, text analysis should also follow the same rule. Our sample is limited to those appearing between September 6 and December 3 1, 200 I concerning typhoon Nari and its aftermath Classification analysis: analyze extracted features from sentences and discriminate these features into classes. For nouns, following the official organization structure of Tzu Chi, we classified the general identities into six categories: Charity Culture, Medicine, Education, Volunteers and the Headquarters. For verbs, referring to their attributes, we classified them into 9 categories V-Class care, cleaning, coordinatiodcommunicatiou counselinglvisiting, food, organizatiodcommand interaction, and others. This step can only be done with domain knowledge and under supervision Thus, it qualifies as a classification analysis Statistical analysis: frequency distribution of nouns and verbs enabled us to fit cross-category analyses. For instance, what are the projected actions appear most frequently? To which identity group do these projected actions most often belong? And, over time, is there any particular pattern in nouns, verbs, and their interactive relationships, in terms of frequency distribution 3 Analytic Results 


3 Analytic Results We associated the unit of analysis, nouns, verbs analysis of nouns, analysis of verbs, media type and time frame, and generated a series of graphs. With data consistency and integrity secured, these information can not only he shared but enable accurate and efficient storage retrieval and analyses of the data. For instance, by fitting all identities with frequency higher than one with the five group categories, we discovered that the single most important identity during the whole time span was the neutral term of  volunteers  i.e., the rank and file of the organization. This label, in turn, belongs to the charity group. The second most significant identities were  0   Tzu Chi  A  memben of TN Chi do not suggest any organizational linkage. Clearly, the bureaucratic sector did not play an important role in the whole operation \(see Figure 1 Another instance is the projected actions. Over time we discovered that action terms used by the two official Tzu Chi journals highly concentrated in September and October, suggesting that projected actions may have been timedependent. Some activities are more needed in a specific time than in others. Among the nine major action categories, communications, cleaning, interaction, food and direct personal assistance have the highest frequencies OrganizatiodCommand    was far less significant. \(see Figure 2 By comparison, the two national newspapers, United Daily and China Ernes, associated  command  category most \(graphs not shown either the mass media may have been covering the story with their own  frames  or, the Tzu Chi journals might have been intentionally framing their organization in a way that was notably different from most other similar groups Given that all mass media tend to follow similar professional guidelines in covering stories, we believe that it is more like to the former case, namely the two national dailies simply followed their own frames instead of looking into the actual mobilization process of Tzu Chi This is a very good example demonstrating what text data mining can he capable oE bring up previously unknown inferences from readily available information, with, of course, the help of pre-existing howledge ahout the subject matter The most complex analysis we experimented was to locate some relationship between identity, identity categories, projected actions and actions categories over time. We complete this process by first creating three-dimensional graphs through cross analysis, then repeating the same procedure for each period of time. For instance, we excavated the top 10 identities with the highest frequencies and their distribution pattern among the identity categories. We did this using only September data. Then, we refit the analysis, using October data. Then 244 repeat the other months. The mining results were then juxtaposed in sequential order and created a 4-D visualization \(see Figure 3 Figure 1 .  Frequency Distribution of Major Identities by Groups Figure 2. Frequency Distribution of Major Categories of Projected Actions by Time Frame 245 Figure 3. Associational Patterns of Identities and Identity Groups over Time 4 Concluding Discussions This study experimented to test the association rule approach of data mining on a text database. The primary goal was to excavate previously unknown  knowledge  from readily available information. To that end, we have succeeded. We have also tried to demonstrate that utilizing pre-existing knowledge of the subject matter, i.e., domain knowledge, researchers may be better-off in creating user-friendly mining 


may be better-off in creating user-friendly mining rules. At least for our sample, we consider this to be another achieved goal So, where does this lead us to? There are many methods being employed for conducting data mining now. Most of them deal with numerical data. For this kind of databases, researchers are mainly pondering upon the fastest and most efflcient way to store and retrieve data. Interpretation of the retrieved results, in turn, was considered the job for end users. This logic does not apply to text databases, especially those containing unstructured texts written in .natural language. The distinction line is the  context  Cohen and Singer 1999 sentences do not yield as many meanings as when they are put into contexts. For instance  direct personal assistance  may not sound particularly interesting in any text. However, when the reader clearly understands that this action was executed in emergency relief tasks and by a group of like-minded volunteers, its implication clearly is different. Both natural and social sciences have witnessed significant increase of text data recently. If we keep in mind that all sciences require effective communication, or  sense making  if you will, then the issue salience of  meaning  in text data mining is self-evident Locating the themes and making sense of this finding can be used as effective tool for business operation \(Dorre et al. 1999 of the texts in daily corporation communications is relevant or useful may constitute a burden for any business. Using our approach of exploring association patterns between different categories, such as between identities and projected actions, it is possible to prepare unstructured textual data toward creating knowledge. Ideally, it should be noted, such mining process should be automatic to achieve the maximum 246 efficiency and speed. Nevertheless, our study used texts written in Chinese characters. Up to now, there is not automatic process of data retrieval for any Chinese character-based databases. Creating an algorithm for this purpose was never our goal. However, this issue certainly deserves further exploration by other researchers, Indeed, our approach indicated that small corporations may particularly benefit themselves from this technique, if their objective is to sorting out their own text data. Since the association rule is sample-specific, the initial sample serves as a key map to smooth the way for future data classification and management, even without an algorithm tool. Over time, of course, this key map should be updated to he commensurate with internal changes of the organization As a method of research, association rule mining needs to deal with some potential problems still Among other things, this method is highly dependent on statistical inferences generated from word frequencies, As such, it would have to address two fundamental issues in statistics: reliability and validity Space does not allow for a full-scale discussion for these issues. It sufftces to say this much once the relational database is created and mining rules established, the overall reliability is sufficiently high Nevertheless, the ultimate concern is on validity wherein the scheme, definitions, classifications, and analytical results make sense to the largest amount of end users. That issue along demands for an independent investigation. Our study at least points to one direction: such validity is not impossible to acquire from a text database

Figure I. Performance of RSASM and Apriori algorithm on the various amounts of transactions 500, 1000, 1500,2000,2500 items respective in 50000 transactions of Kperimental data are randomly sampled from the original database. The minimum support of Apriori algorithm is 0.45% also, and the computation times and the numbers of frequent itemsets found by the two algorithms are shown in Figure 2 a Figure 2. Performance of RSASM and Apriori algorithm on the various amounts of items The experimental results in Figure 1 and Figure 2 show that the RSASM performs batter and more rapid than the Apriori algorithm. The RSASM is not only eliminating considerable amounts of data, but also decreasing the numbers of database scanning, thus reducing the computation quantities to perform data constrasts and also memory requirements. With the multiple minimum supports the numbers of frequent itemsets is sententious than that of the Apriori algorithm with small minimum support 5 Mining of multidimensional association rules As that can be seen, mining of association rules is applied mainly on transaction database. An interesting fact in transaction database is that, if mining single dimensional association rules, the dimension will always be buys; if mining multidimensional association rules, buys are always the consequent part of the rules too. No matter which situation, the dimension of buys is the main part for constituting the association rules Look back the example mentioned above age\(Y0-29 female buysrfaddish journal monthly This is a multidimensional association rule with four dimensions, it can be seen that the other dimensions are simpler than that of buys. The contents of buys is constituted by a variety of items, it may be gocery or commodity, that is, the dimension buys can be subdivided as different category. Only the dimension buys can come into being an information system with transactions as rows and items as columns as that discussed in Section 4. The other dimension such as age, sex, or income is simple and unnecessary to subdivide, which can be added directly into the information system as one certain attribute, it will only posses one column in the information system analogous an item. So if mining multidimensional association rules, transform the original transaction databases into appropriate form of information system, the mining process with the RSASM algorithm is same as minimg of singledimensional association rules. If the attribute is quantitative, it is discretized using predefined concept hierarchies as shown in section 4.1, then it can be treated as categorical attribute for further mining. This part is similar to the algorithm that mining multidimensional association rules using discretization of quantitative attributes shown in [l], hut the sets of attrihute is mixed together for mining, the results will be a mixed rule sets with multidimensional and singledimensional association 3535 rules together. Because of the efficiency of RSASM, the reduction of computation time and numbers of frequent itemsets can be foresighted 6 Conclusions An efficient algorithm for identifymg the frequent itemsets can he useful in various data mining problems such as the discovery of the association rules. In this paper, the RSASM is proposed to mining single dimensional and multidimensional association rules Mining rules with the RSASM algorithm is a multi-step process: generalizing database to discretize quantitative attributes and decrease quantity of data at first, then finding candidate itemsets with the concept of equivalence 


finding candidate itemsets with the concept of equivalence class, next finding frequent itemsets with multiple minimum supports. The algorithm provides better performance improvements. The gap hetween the RSASM and Apriori algorithms becomes evident with the number and size of pattems identified and the searching time reduced. At the posterior part of the paper, it discusses that RSASM algorithm can be expanded to mining of multidimensional association rules simply, with transform the database into appropriate form, detailed situation will he researched further Acknowledgement China 973 Plan supported this work under grant N0.2002CB3 12200 References I iechniques, Morgan Kauhann Publishers, 2000 2] J.

Fig. 5. FP-tree for the database TDB in TableI nodes of theFP-tree In the next scan, the set of sorted \(frequency descending order prefix-tree as a branch. The root node of the tree is labeled with "null", every other node in theFP-tree additionally stores a counter which keeps track of the number of itemsets that share that node. When the frequent items are sorted in their frequency descending order, there are better chances that more prefixes can be shared, thus theFP-tree representation of the database can be kept as small as possible The compact transaction database and CT-tree data structure introduced in the previous sections are very different from above approaches. First of all, the prefix-tree andFP-tree data structure are constructed in the main memory to optimize the frequent pattern mining process, whereas CT-tree is designed to generate compact transaction database and store it to disk for efficient frequent pattern mining and othermining process in which compact database can save storage space and reduce mining time In addition, the counter associated with each node in the prefix-tree and FP-tree stores the number of transaction containing the itemset represented by the path from the root to the node. However, each path from every node of the CT-tree to the root represents a unique transaction, and the associated counter records the number of occurrences of this transaction in the original transaction database Moreover, for a given transaction database, the number of nodes and node-links in FP-tree will change with different minimum support threshold specified by the user. But there is only one unchanged CT-tree for every transaction database And the FP-tree structure can be constructed from a compact transaction database more efficiently in only one database scan, since the head part of a compact transaction database lists all items in frequency descending order, and the body part stores all ordered transactions associated with their occurrence counts VII. CONCLUSIONS We have proposed an innovative approach to generating compact transaction databases for efficient frequent pattern mining. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by the experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets. It can not only reduce the number of transactions in the original databases and save storage space but also greatly reduce theI/O time required by database scans and improve the efficiency of the mining process We have assumed in this paper that the CT-tree data structure will fit into main memory. However, this assumption will not apply for very large databases. In that case, we plan to partition original databases into several small parts until the corresponding CT-tree can be fit in the available memory. This work is currently in progress VIII.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
