A key problem with the existing wrappers is that the wrapped rnle learned fmm the examples is only adaptive for the specific website. Io this paper, we propose a novel approach, DBFinder, to discover interest data blocks fmm a set of Web pages. It is a key step in the data extraction. The p m c w  of DBFinder consists of two phases: semi-supenised wrapping and unsupervised wrapper. The goal of the first phase is to learn the wrapped rules for the specific website The goal of the second phase is to popularize the wrapped rules for other websites in the same domain with the sample website. WO kinds of data mining techniques, frequent sub-tree mining and association rule mining, are used to accomplish such a goal. To demonstrate the feasibility of our appmach, some detailed experiments are conducted. We have also applied our approach In a real application, which is a comparisonshopping agent Keywords association rule mining; comparisonahopping 1. Introductiou Data extraction; wrapper; fquent  sub-tree mining There is a tremendous amounts of information available on the Web, but much of this information is not in a form that can be easily used by other applications. The reason is that Web data sources are intended to be browsed by humans, and are not computed by applications. As a consequence, extracting data from Web pages and making it available to computer applications remains a complex and relevant task Data extraction from HTh4L is usually performed by software modules called wrappers. In most cases, examples are used to  lea  how the data of interest is presented in the sample pages. An essential step is using the textual surroundings of the data to generate a wrapper. A key problem with the existing wrappers is that the wrapped rule learned from the examples is only adaptive for the specific website. Can the knowledge be also adaptive for any new website in the same domain with the example website? This is the goal we attempt to accomplish In this paper, we develop a novel approach called DBFmder to discover interest data blocks from a set of Web pages. The discovery of interest data blocks is a key step in the data extraction. DBFinder takes advantage of two kinds of data mining techniques, frequent sub-tree mining and association rule mining. Because most target pages in a website are generated by a template, the frequent sub-tree mining algorithm can be used to discover such a template from the parsing trees of the pages. For example, the pages about different products in an e-business website usually have the similar format \(template algorithm is used to learn the knowledge from the sample pages. Then, DBFinder applies the knowledge to identify the similar content in the target website The key contributions of our work are as follows A novel approach called DBFinder is presented to discover interest data blocks from a set of Web pages DBFmder adopts the divide-and-conquer algorithm to learn the wrapping rules we apply the frequent sub-tree mining algorithm   discover !he template of pages in a website. We call it 


discover !he template of pages in a website. We call it website-level mining. As far we know, it is the fmt time that frequent sub-tree mining is introduced into the domain of data extraction We apply the association rule mining algorithm to discover the frequent itemsets from the pages co l lecy from the sample websites. Then the knowledge can be used to guide DBFinder to discover the similar content from the target website. We called it domain-level mining The associufion model of panem free \(AMPT proposed to calculate the association value between the pattern free \(F  T AR 2. Related Work Alberto Laender \(11 presents a taxonomy for grouping 0-7803-8403-2/04/$20.00 WW4 IEEE 1441 the various Web data extraction tools. The taxonomy is based on the main technique used by each tool to generate a wrapper, what let us to the following groups of tools: 1 Wrapper induction tools. Tools such as STALKER [2 W E N  [3] are representative of this approach. 2 HTML-aware Tools. Some representative tools based on such an approach are RoadRunner [41, XWRAF  51. 3 h g u a g e s  for Wrapper Development. Web-SQL 161 is a declarative query language that is capable of locating selected pieces of data in HTML pages. 4 I Tools. Representative tools based on such an approach are WHISK [7]. 5 DEByE [SI is representative of this approach. 6 Ontology-based Tools[9 P. B. Golgher [lo] inmduces how to use a pre-existing data repository to automatically generate examples and allow full automated example based data extraction. They propose an altemative strategy that uses a source repository fo identify similar data in the target sites and automatically assemble examples for extracting data from that site. Their approach provides buman-independent bootstrapping for example-based data extraction on the Web. However, the source repository needs to be generated in advance from a legacy database or by using a previously existing wrapper Moreover, it is a basic requirement in their strategy that the intersection between the data available in the source repository and the data available in the target sites be non-empty 3. A d a t i o n  Model of Pattem Tree 3.1 Problem Statement Tbmugh the observation of a large amount of e-shops we conclude the following empirical facts: 1 product, the discrepancy of its price is insignificant over different websites. 2 are usually generated by a template in a website. We say that these pages are similnr, meaning that either the structure or content of the pages are similar. Moreover there are many websites using &lt;TABLE&gt; to layout their pages. The information of a product is included in one or more dABLE&gt;. 3 cTABLE&gt;, &lt;TR&gt;, 4D&gt;, form a tag hierarchy. Thus, the data block can be. converted into a parsing tree. 4 features, such as  price  we fmd it remains the same over different parsing trees. Such a feature is regarded as field feature. Otherwise it is regarded as value feature. 5 specific domain, the interest data blocks collected from different sites often share a large number of common feathers Proceedmgs of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and CybernetiFs, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 1442 Based on the above observation, we define the following data structures Definition: Interest Ceu] Interest cell, denoted bx node\(f,v 


node\(f,v refers to wrapped field and v refers to the corresponding value.For example, \(price, $4280 Here, we mainly extract the fields such as name image, price, and performance. We use a pre-existing dictionary to identify the name of the product. According to HTML tag &lt;img src    gt;, the image can be identified. A pattem matching method is applied to identify the price. At last, the textual information in the data block is regarded as the performance of the product petinition: Dah Block] Data blocz refers to the minimum lt;TABLE&gt; that comprises all the interest cells. Figure 1 is a typical example for data block We denote a data block as a tree T=\(V, E of nodes, and E the set of branches. There are two kinds of nodes: tag nodes and text node. Here we only concern the key tag, such as &lt;TABLE&gt;, &lt;Tb, a&gt;, and so on. The size of T, denoted ITI, is the number of nodes in T. Branch e = \( v , , v y We say that a tree S=\(V,, E denoted as S + T  , provided 1 e=\(vx ,Vy v.. A subtree of size k is also called a k-subtree Figure 1. an example for data block Definition: Associalion Repository] Association repository refers to the set of frequent itemsets discovered from the data blocks.

Applying a stemming algorithm and removing stop words in the stop-list, keywords can be extracted from the data blocks Then, the texts in the data block are fed to an association rule mining algorithm that takes the word as item and the data block as transaction, generates a set of frequent itemsets \(AR Definition: Paftem Dee] Pattem tree refers to the template used to generate the pages in a website Most interest data block, which is wrapped from a website, are generated by a template.

The mining process would generate some candidate pattern tree. In order to evaluate the candidate pattem tree, we define two interest measures: support degee and association probability SupportDegree Let 6 T\(S S The support of, a sub-tree S in the forest \(the set of data blocks S S be a user-specified minimum support value.

The dimension of vector X is the number of frequent itemsets in L. Each entry xi refers to the weight of frequent itemset li . The vector X is denoted as X = \(x ,  , x2 ,..x m x \( a j  . ~ ~ P P O W J ~ I I  x m

The parameter m refers to the number of frequent items in the itemset f i  . The' parameter a is a position factor, whose value is decided by the occurrence of l i [  j ]  in the frequent sub-tree The explicit meaning of equation \(1 In the association repository, the weight of frequent itemset I i  is linear to the support of l i ;  ii occurred in the frequent sub-tree would promote the weight Let Q\(S of l i An association rule mining technique is applied to Q\(S and generates a set of frequent subset, denoted by L Correspondingly, L' can be expressed with a n-dimensional vector E Y = { y , ,  yz ,  '. . , yn ] .Thereinto m E@, ~suppon\( l , [ j l y ,  =W\( l ,  IY l, IY 2 Then, suppose the angle between vector X and Y is 0 the association probability between X and Y, denoted by p r \( X , Y The candidate patkm tree with the greatest p r \( X , Y value is'regarded as the pattern tree for the website 4. DBFinder: A Stepwise Learning AppFoaeh Given some user-labeled examples, the goal of DBFinder is to conclude the wrap rules of the specified website and then popularize it to other websites in the same domain. The problem of DBFinder generation can be represented as follows Given a Web pages P containing a set of implicit objects, determine a mapping1 W that populates a data repository R with the objects in P. The rest consists of two phases Semi-Supervised Wrapping \(SSW Given any other pages P' similar to P \(pages P and P are taken from the same website S mapping W must also be capable of recognizing and extracting data from paeg P Given any other pages P' similar to P \(pages P are taken from a website S ' ,  distinct frbm S ,  hut whose objects belong to the same domain of those present in P recognizing and extracting data from paeg P We use the term similar in a very empirical sense, meaning that both the structure and the content of the pages are similar Thus, the process of DBFinder contains two steps SSW and USW. In the fmt  step, DBFinder receives as input a set of example pages. Using a GUI, the user hierarchically decomposes the document, outlining its interest regions and describing their semantics. From the examples, DBFinder generates panerns m e  \(PT indicate the structure and the textual surroundings of the objects to be extqcted.

the example websites. Second, we applied our proposed association mode of panem trek, \(AMPT association probability of the sub-trees  discovered by PFTM and generate the pattern tree for the target site Moreover, to accurately and reliably extract price data is one of the key problems that must be solved by a scalable comparison-shopping tool. For example, suppose there are several numbers in a data block, how to select the proper number as the price? Here we use a verification matrix C to do this job. The verification matrix is defmed as follows The enhy ci.j refers to the price of the #j product in i website. The row vector denotes the price of different products in the same website. The column vector denotes the price of the same product in different website Suppose that the distribution of price fluctuation should obey Gauss distribution Then the verification matrix C is applied to pick the proper price from the noisy data block 4.1 Semi-supervised Wrapping \(SSW Algorithm: SemiSupervisedWrap Input: n \(n&lt;lO m4 sample pages in each sample website Output: a association repository; d The semi-supervised wrapping process is detailed as follows 1 a representation that reflects its HTML tag hierarchy.

Using a GUI, the user hierarchically decomposes the document, outlining the boundary of interest data block and describing their semantics 2 DBFinder generates a pattem tree that handle structural mismatched found among the m data blocks. The panem tree indicates the structure and the textual sumundings of the objects to be extracted 3 DBFinder to wrap data from other pages collected from the same website 4 websites, DBFinder obtains a set of data block. There is a large number of textual information hidden in the data blocks. We apply a Chinese word segmentation tool to segment the texts into words.

Because the interest data block in one website are generated by a template, one would like to discover the template \(frequent sub-tree mining algorithm. Please refer to.[ll] for details The unsupervised wrapping algorithm is detailed as follows Algorithm: UnSupervisedWrap Input: i  target website; ii repository: iii Output i  iii updated verification matrix 1 lata cleaning process is applied to the pages collected from the target website, such as using the verification matrix to verify the price in the candidate data block. Then we obtain a subset

The PFTM algorithm takes as input the document trees and generates a complete set of frequent sub-trees sorted by its support value. Then, the n former sub-trees with high support value, denoted by Y = { Y , , Y , , . . . Y , J ,  are selected from the set of frequent sub,trees 3 Ui E Y 1444 Proceedings of the Third International Conference 00 Machine teaming and Cybernetics, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 equation \(3 me frequent sub-tree y, with the maximum association rate* denoted by Pr\(Y outperforms the unsupervised wrapper by an average of ahout 10 percents.

Experiment Analysis To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we have conducted three kinds of experiments. The first is to calculate the precision and recall of DBFinder. The second is to automatically identify the field-value from the data blocks by using DBFinder. The third is to apply DBFinder to a comparison-shopping system called Ego 5.1 PrefiSionlRecall of DBFinder We apply two measures widely used in evaluating the performance of IR systems, precision and recall rate, to the following experiments and verify the quality of our proposed methods. We write a band-coding wrapper in advance. Regards the records extracted by hand-ceng wrapper as total records, measure of precision and recall are defined in equation \(5 6 5 6 To test the precision-recall of DBFmder, we use the data we have collected from some Chinese popular websites in the domain of mobile phone. The data  is divided into two groups. Each goup contains the data collecfed from 10 mobile phone websites. The fxst is fed to the semi-supervised wrapper. The second is fed to the unsupervised Wrapper Table 1 shows the precision-recalls for semi-supervised wrapper. From table I ,  we can see. that the highest recall \(showji cnool is 0.63. We check the pages collected from showji and fmd that each data block includes three a B L E &gt;  and the format tends to be unique. However, the data block in cnool consists of some noisy tables and the position of price is far from that of the product. These two factors depress the rate of precision and recall Table 2 shows the precision-recalls for unsupervised w r a p r .  The average precision is 0.83 and the average  recall is 0.71. We can see that the semi-supervised wrapper of correctlyxtracted records of extractedrecords of correctlyxtractedrecords of total records P =  Precision R=Recull feasibility of our proposed approach. The precisiodrecall of 139shop. 0.63/0.52 is not perfect. By tracing the pages collected from 139shop, we found that the data block consists of too many noisy anchors and images, such as 


 anchors of related news  Moreover, the position of specification is far from that of the product. The noisy features included in the irrelated anchors degrade the precision/recall rate Table 1: the Recision-Recall for Semi-supervised Wrapper I Site I ~ o t a l  I extra- I cone~tlv I P I R ,I Table 2 the Recision-Recall for Unsupervised Wrapper I site I 5.2 Automatic Identify \(field, value 1445 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 Figure 2 shows an example for pattern tree, which is discovered from www.showii.com.

The user can input a keyword, such nokia 8250, in the edit box. The detailed information, such product, image, price, and performance, are displayed in 6. Conclusions In this paper, we present a novel approach, DBFmder to discover interest data blocks from a set of Web pages The process of DBFinder consists of two phases semi-supervised wrapping \(SSW wrapper \(USW allows the user to label the sample pages. In the second phase, USW automatically discovers the interest data blocks by using the knowledge learned from the sample pages and from the test pages. No training data will be given to USW. According to the previous experiments, we can conclude that our proposed methods are feasible to discover interest contents from web pages In the future, we will develop other methods to automatically discover pages clusters from Web sites.

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
