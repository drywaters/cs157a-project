Moreover, update mining is very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a new method that designs a new structure d e d  Trans-Tree, which stores all of the information in a highly wmpaft form. The algorithm mines frequent patterns are based on Trans-Tree. Updating with new data needs one scan of the new data only. Thus, it improves performance greatly Keywords Frequent Patterns; FP-Tree; Trans-Tree 1. Introduction Association rule mining core data mining tasks and has attracted tremendous interest among researchers and practitioners. ARM is undirected or unsupervised data mining over variable-length data, and it produces clear, understandable results. An association rule is an implication of the form X=&gt;Y, where X and Y are sets of items and XnY=Q. The support s of such a rule is that s l  of transactions in the database contain X u  Y, the confidence c is that c% of transactions in the database contains X also contains Y at the meantime. A rule can be considered interesting if it satifies the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold, which can be set by domain experts Most of the previous researches with regard to association mining was based on Apriori-like alg~rithms['.~,''. They can he decomposed into twosteps 1. Find all frequent itemsets that hold transaction support above the minimum support thnvshold 2. Generate the desired rules from the frequent itemsets if they also satisfy the minimum confdence threshold Apriori-like algorithms iteratively obtain candidate itemsets of size \(k+l Each iteration requires a scan of the original database. It is costly and inefficient to repeatedly scan the datahase and check a large set of candidate for their occurrence frequencies. Additionally, when new data come in, we have to run the entire algorithms again to update the rules There are various methods to improve Apriori performance. While these measures improve the situation there are still many problems. Recently, an FP-tree based frequent pattems mining141 method developed b Han achieved high efficiency, compared with Apriori" and TreeProjection'sl algorithms. It avoids iterative candidate generations. But there are some prohlems 1 .Creating conditional FP-Tree separately and recursively during the mining process 2. Updating of FP-tree requires two scans of the new data and existing data In this paper, we design a new structure called Trans-Tree, which stores all of the information in a highly compact form and updates easily. Thus, mining requires only one scan of the database and updating Trans-Tree needs one scan of the new data without scanning the existing data The rest of paper are organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce a new structure, called Trans-Tree, and discuss how to generate the Trans-Tree by only one database scan in section 3. An illustrative example is shown 


database scan in section 3. An illustrative example is shown in section 4. In section 5 ,  we present our experimental results. Finally, section 6 provides the conclusions 2. Frequent Pattern and Trans-Tree The frequent pattern mining can he formally defined as follows. Let I={il, iz, ... , i be a transaction database, where each transaction T is a set of items and T d .  An unique identifier, called its TID, is assigned with each transaction. A transaction T contains a pattem P, a set of items in I, if P c T .  The support of a pattem P is the number of transactions containing P in DB 0-7803-8403-~04/$20.00 WOO4 IEEE 1683 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybemedcs, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 We can say that P is a frequent pattern if P  s support is no less than a predefined minimum support threshold 6 The FP-tree is a prefix-tree structure storing frequent items for the transaction database, the frequent items in eacb path are sorted in their frequency descending order The FP-tree based method has to scan the database twice to get an FP-trei, whose central idea is to get the list 6 of item frequencies in the fwst time and then construct the FP-tree in the second time according to L. The Trans-Tree, unlike FP-tree, which contains the frequent items only, contains all items that appear in the original database. Therefore Trans-Tree is also a prefix-tree structure storing all items of transactions that are sorted in numerical order and record the actual support of every-item. Thus, the constriction method of Trans-Tree is similar with that oTFP-tree 3. The Proposed Algorithm   The goal of this paper is deal with the following problems: mini.mize scans of the database and data is easy to use and update. Thus, we design a new data structure Trans-Tree that stores all of the essential information of the database that is compact.. So, a new mining algorithm based on Trans-Tree can be divided into the following three steps 1. Construct Trans-Tree and obtain the item frequency Z..Construct Frequent-Trans-Tree from the Trans-Tree 3.Call FIT-Mine algorithm to mining directly on Frequent-Trans-Tree Thus, mining requires only one scan of the database Since we can generate the Trans-Tree by scanning the database only once, we are also able to update the Trans-Tree by one scan of new data without the need for two scans of the existing database and the second  scan for the new data. Thus, we can first insert the new transactions into the Trans-Tree according to the item frequency list F and meanwhile update the list. Then .a new Trans-Tree can be restructured according to the updated item frequency list Thus, updating algorithm needs one scan of the new data only, and the existing data do not need to be re-scanned 3.1. lkans-lkee Construction Input: A transaction database DE Output: Trans-Tree and the item frequency list F Description list F 1 2 3 Create the root of a Trans-Tree: T and label it as  null   Initial the set of items F and their supports Scan the transaction database DE once, for each transaction T in DB do the following a.

AnExample Let the transaction database DB be Table 1 and minsup 2. After scanning all the transactions, we can obrain Trans-Tree. Then, the Frequent-Trans-Tree constructed from Trans-Tree is shown in Figure 1. Finally, all frequent pattems in DE can be mined, which is shown in Table 2 Table 1 A Transaction Database root C : 2 d : l I Fig.l frequent-prefix- tree of table 1 Database 5. Experimental Results In this section, we evaluate our mining algorithm FTT-Mine and updating algorithm FIT-UMine and compare them with the FP-based approach. All experiments ..,- .J~ perfamed on 1GHz Pentium 111  PC with 256MB of memory, running Windows 2000 Professional. A real database\(mushroom database hap://www.ics.uci.edu/-mlea"mary.html were 


hap://www.ics.uci.edu/-mlea"mary.html were used as input in the experiments. The characteristics of mushroom database include: 8124 transactions and 23 items. Each method comsponding to the support thresholds 0.51, 1W.21, 31.4% and 5%. Their runtimes are shown in Figure 2. As shown, our mining algorithm is faster than FP-Growth algorithm because of scanning the database only once  miniup \(X t FTT-Mine -P-Growth Fig. 2 comparision of mining Figure 3 shows the runtimes of each method when update happens to a database, which originally contains 4OOO transactions. The number of transactions in each update is 500,1000,2000,3000 and 4OOO respectively and the support threshold is 2%. Because updating Trans-Tree needs one'scan of the new data only without scanning the existing data, the runtime of OUT updating algorithm is greatly decreased, which is shown in Figure 3 4000 3000 2000 1000 500 New data t FTT-Mine --C FP-Growth Fig.3 comparision of updating 6. Conclusions We have proposed a new data structure, Trans-Tree and discussed how to get the Trans-Tree by one database scan and how to get the corresponding Frequent-Trans-Tree from the Trans-Tree. The efficiency of mining and updating based on Frequent-Trans-Tree is higher than those of based on FP-tree Acknowledgements This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 60273075 References 113 Agrawal R, Srikant R, Fast Algorithm for Mining Association Rules.

An average effect stands for R-values between 0.67 and 0.34. The explanatory power is weak for an R between 0.34 and 0.19 and overall not relevant for R-values under 0.19 [1    Figure 2: Structural model validation   Therefore R of our research model for the intention to use self- and e-assessment can be categorized as substantial expressive for perceived usefulness and as an average effect for intention  4.4. Results  The results of our empirical research based on our explorative case study is that the intention to use self and e-assessments can be explained by Davis perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use Furthermore antecedents of perceived usefulness are perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings derived of the MATH e ll as th e [36]. Statistical  support can be provided for all the hypothesized relations between constructs except of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness  5. Limitations  As with any work in a new field of research relevant literature about self- and e-assessments to build on is almost nonexistent. Unfortunately the operationalization of "perceived cost and time savings" as well as perceived quality improvements  in this paper could consequently not build on earlier work too much so we had to derive them of the MATH m  w e ll as t h e UT A U T  36   As with any empirical field study, this work has limitations. It is important to note that we have build an explorative model to examine the acceptance of self- and e-assessments. As this study provides support for a significant influence of PU and PEOU Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
