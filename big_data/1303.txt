The first step concentrates is using association rules mining methods to discover new similarity relationships among attributes. The second step is to exploit this similarity during the calculation of item similar. Finally, combines new similarity and rating similarity measures to find neighbor item in item based CF algorithm and generating ratings predictions based on a combined similarity measure. The experiments show that this novel approach can achieve better prediction accuracy than traditional item-based CF algorithm 1 Introduction In e-commerce environment, Collaborative Filtering CF technology to date such as Amazon.com and CDNOW provide interesting and powerful recommendation services. The goal of a CF algorithm [1,2] is to recommend new items or predict the utility of a certain item for a certain user based on the user  s preference and other user  s opinions. In a CF scenario there is a list of m users U = {ur,lr2, ..., U,,,} and a list of n items I il,i2 ,..., in}. Each user has a rating vector R, where rk represents the user  s rating for item ik \(The user  s opinion and preference are explicitly given by the rating score the rating score for an unrated item i k  \(called target item algorithms, user-based and item-based. User-based CF algorithm uses some statistical techniques to find a set of users called user neighbors for the target user. Then different methods can be adopted to combine the user neighbors  ratings to product a prediction rating for the target user. Recently, a new class of item-based CF algorithm has been proposed to deal with the scalability problem in user-based CF algorithm [3], The idea is rather than find similar users \(user neighbors algorithm tries to find similar items that are rated by different users in some similar ways. Then for a target item predictions can be generated by taking a weighted average of the target user  s ratings on these similar items. However the item-based CF algorithm still suffer from the problems associated with data sparsity, and they still lack the ability to provide recommendations or predictions for new or recently added items. The contribution of this paper is an approach to solve these problems that still exits in item-based CF algorithm in two distinct stages We use association rule mining methods to discover new similarity relationships among attributes of items Finally we combine the attributes simiIarity and the rating similarity measures to find item neighbors and predictions based on a combined similarity measure 


predictions based on a combined similarity measure Item-based CF Algorithm Item-based CF algorithm looks into the set of items the target user has rated and computes how similar they are to the target item i and ?hen selects k most similar items i,,i2, ..., ik computed. Once the most similar items are found and then, the prediction is computed by taking a weighted average o f  the target user  s ratings on these similar items. Item-based CF algorithm consists of two processes, finding similar items and generating rating prediction based on similar item  s ratings Sim\(ij I 2  J !A I Figure 1. Similarity computation 1674 2.1 Finding Similar Items The first step in computing the similarity of items i and i temj  is to identify all the users who have rated both item i a n d j  \(as show in Figure.1 where the matrix rows represent users and the columns represent items, There are a number of different methods to compute the similarity between items. The most popular methods are given below The cosine-based similarity is presented in Equation 1 column vectors in the user ratings matrix R.  The similarity between them is measured by computing the cosine of the angle between these two vectors where U means the set of users who both rated i and j Rq,; means the rating of user U on item i The correlation-based similarity is presented in Equation \(2 where Ri means the average rating of the i-th item The adjusted cosine similarity is presented in Equation 3  where R ,  means the average rating of user U 2.2 Prediction Computation The next step is to select a set of most similar items to the target item and generate a predicted rating for the target item using weighted sum as show in Equation \(4 where P,,,i means the prediction rating of target user II on item i. Only the K nearest neighbors of item i 3 Our approach, we integrate the similarity attributes and item ratings to calculate the item-item similarity in the finding item neighbors step Overview of Adding Item Content L 1 Figure 2. Added item-based CF Gamework In Figure 2 shows the detail of our approach describes as follows Represents the contents of items as 3 set of boolean values, each row represents an item and each column represents a unique attribute value. Then convert the contents of items into transaction of attributes Apply association rules mining to discover similarity relationship among attributes of items, and exploit this new simiIarity to find similar items Compute the similarity: firstly, calculate the similarity of item content using new similarity that will be describe in the section 3.2, then calculate the similarity of item ratings using user-item rating matrix that described in section 2.1. At last, the total similarity is the linear combination of the above two Make a prediction for an item by performing a weighted average of deviations from the neighbour's mean 3.1 Mining Similarity Attributes In this section, we describe applying association rules 


In this section, we describe applying association rules mining, in particular the Apriori algorithm [5] to extract association rules between each pair of attributes in transaction of amibutes. The association rules [6] are of the form X 3 Y, where Xand Yare sets of items \(item contents set of attributes contains another itemset Y. The probability that a given rule holds, the confidence, is the percentage of tran~actions containing Y given that Xoccurs The support of itemset X is defined as the fraction of transactions supporting X with respect to the entire database. The support of a rule X 2 Y is the probability that both itemsets occur together in a transaction 1675 The measure of rule confidence is related to support and can be computed as follow Rule Action 3 Drama Action 3 Comedy Action 3 Romance support\(x U Y Support \(x X 3 Y 7 Support ~ Confidence 25% 34 7% 11 14% 17 The association rules that satisfy user specified minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold are called strong association rules Treating item contents as transactions and the item attributes therein as itemsets, the Apriori algorithm can be used to derive a set of attribute-attribute rules and associated confidence levels. We have limited this initial phase of the work to rules with single-attribute antecedents and consequents. Table 1 shows some sample rules that were generated by running Apriori on the EachMovie dataset. The confidence values are taken as probabilities and used to fill in the attribute-attribute similarity matrix, as shown in Table 2, which provides the additional similarity attributes necessary to find similar items Comedy=.Romance I 5 Table 1: Sample association rules 7 Table 2: A simple attribute-attribute similarity matrix Action Comcdy Drama Romancc Action Comedy Drama Romance 3.2 Finding Similar Items Using Similarity Attributes In this section we descript how attributes similarity can be usefully exploited to fmding similar items. The item similarity metric is the mean of the similarities between the attributes in the target item case t and the compare item case c as follows As for, The computation of the similarities between the attributes in the item cases t and c consists of two cases as show in Equation \(9 10 ASim\(t,, c, n 9 In the situation where there is a direct correspondence between an attribute in the target, ti and the compare, c the maximal similarity is assumed, otherwise, the similarity value of attribute in the target item is computed 3s the mean similarity between this attribute and the n most similar attributes in the compare item c cl, c2 ,..., cn using similarity attributes works on given movies, with a solid arc showing attribute overlap and dashed arcs

Finding similar items using similarity attributes 3.3 The item similarities measure ISim\(ij], for a pair of item i and j ,  is computed using the similarity attributes as described in Section 3.2. Similarly, we compute item similarities based on the user-item matrix as described in Section 2.1, we denote the rating similarity between two item i a n d j  as RSim\(ij3. Finally, for each pair of items i and j ,  we combine these two similarity measures to get CSim\(iJ Equation \(1 1  Prediction Based on a Combined similarity 1676 where a is a combination parameter specifying the weight of similarity in the combined measure. If a = 0 the CSim\(ij i j standard item-based CF. On the other hand, if a = 1 then only the attribute similarity is used which essentially, result in a form of content-based filtering In order to compute predicted ratings, we use the weighted sum approach described in Section 2.2 Specifically, as show in Equation \(1 2 The only difference is that, here we will use the combined item sindarity CSim\(ij i,j generate prediction rating 4 Experiments and Results 4.1 Dataset We perform experiments on a subset of movie rating data collected from the EachMovie dataset [7]. The EachMovie dataset deals with movie items using data from the EachMovie collaborative filtering site depIoyed by Digital Equipment Research Center from 1995 through 1997. The EachMovie dataset consists of 2,811,983 preferences for 1,628 movies rated by 72,916 users. User preferences are represented by means of numeric values from 0 to 1.0, such as 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 0.8, 1.0. In EachMovie dataset, genre can have I O different values such as action, animation, art-foreign classic, comedy, drama, family, horror, romance, and thriller. In our experiment, we retrieved 200 users and 200 movies. Furthermore, we randomly chose 90% of the ratings data as training dataset and the 10% as test dataset 4.2 Evaluation Metria In our experiments, we used MAE \(Mean Absolute Error accuracy by comparing the numerical prediction scores 


accuracy by comparing the numerical prediction scores against the actual user ratings in the test data. The MAE is calculated by summing these absolute errors of the corresponding ratingprediction pairs and then computing the average as show in Equation \(23 the number of rating-prediction pairs between the test data and the prediction result. The goal of an algorithm is to achieve as low a MAE as possible 4.3 Experimental Results The first experiment is the quality comparison of three different similarity algorithms such as cosine correlation and adjusted cosine as described in Section 2.1. We implemented three different similarity algorithms with value of combination parameter U and tested them on our dataset. We performed an experiment where we varied the value of combination parameter a from 0 to 1 in an increment of 0.1 and determine the size of neighbors = 10. We ran these experiments on our training dataset and used test dataset to compute MAE. In Figure 4 shows the results of first experiments. We can observe that the value of combination parameter a does, affect the quaIity of prediction. When combination parameter a = 0, which means traditional item-based CF. When a between 0.1 0.9 means combining attributes similarity with rate similarity. When U = 1, which means oniy using attribute similarity to find similar items and predict rating. Especially, the adjusted cosine similarity given the best result when a = 0.4, after this point the error values start increasing. Hence, we select the adjusted cosine similarity for the next experiment Cosine i%- Adjusted cosine Correlation 1 I 1.02 1 0.98 2 0.96 0.94 0.92 0.9 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Combination parameter Figure 4. Comparison of prediction quality The second experiment is the size of the neighbourhood We performed an experiment where we varied the number of neighbors to be used for adjusted cosine similarity and computed MAE. In Figure 5 shows the results of our experiments. We can observe that the size of neighborhood does affect the quality of prediction where Pu.j means the user U prediction on item i and Ru,i means the user U rating on item i in the test data, N is 1677 30 Neighbors +@- 40 Neighbors 0.99 0.97 2 0.95 0.93 w 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Combination parameter Figure 5. Experiments with neighborhood size The final experiment, we implemented two different similarity attributes methods - one is Euclidean distance and our new similarity methods. In Figure 6 shows the results of experiments. We can observe that our approach for new similarity has a trend to show better performance than the Euclidean distance method especially, when a = 1 the difference is so much otherwise the difference is negligible I + Euclidean Distance I : Our new similarity

The results of our experiments show that the combination of attributes similarity and rating similarity can achieve better prediction accuracy than traditional item-based CF algorithms. For future work, we will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a  variety of collaborative filtering datasets and to make comparative evaluations to other techniques References l ]  J.

Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all closed itemsets which are under the CAM border \(as I1 plus those itemsets which arise in equivalence classes which are cut by the CAM border \(such as for instance ce and cde in Figure 3\(a Proposition 3 Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq ?

Using free sets interpretations I1 and I2 coincide when dealing with anti-monotone constraints because minimal elements are not cut o? by the constraint \(e.g. de in Fig. 3\(a constraints \(e.g. no free solution itemsets in Fig. 3\(b Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 4. Algorithms In this Section we study algorithms for the computation of MP5. We ?rst discuss separately how monotone and anti-monotone constraints can be pushed in the computation, then we show how they can be exploited together by introducing the CCIMiner algorithm 4.1. Pushing Monotone Constraints Pushing CAM constraints deep into the frequent itemset mining algorithm \(attacking the problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM  since they behave exactly as Cfreq . The case is di?erent for CM constraints, since they behave exactly the opposite of frequency. Indeed, CAM constraints can be used to e?ectively prune the search space to a small downward closed collection, while the upward closed collection of the search space satisfying the CM constraints cannot be exploited at the same time. This tradeo? holding on the search space of the computational problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CM extensively studied [18, 9, 4], but all these studies have failed to ?nd the real synergy of these two opposite types of constraints, until the recent proposal of ExAnte [6]. In that work it has been shown that a real synergy of the two opposites exists and can be exploited by reasoning on both the itemset search space and the transactions input database 


set search space and the transactions input database together According to this approach each transaction can be analyzed to understand whether it can support any solution itemset, and if it is not the case, it can be pruned In this way we prune the dataset, and we get the fruitful side e?ect to lower the support of many useless itemsets, that in this way will be pruned because of the frequency constraint, strongly reducing the search space. Such approach is performed with two successive reductions  reduction \(based on monotonicity reduction \(based on anti-monotonicity to  reduction we can delete transactions which do not satisfy CM , in fact no subset of such transactions satis?es CM and therefore such transactions cannot support any solution itemsets. After such reduction, a singleton item may happen to become infrequent in the pruned dataset, an thus it can be deleted by the ?reductions. Of course, these two step can be repeated until a ?xed point is reached, i.e. no more pruning is possible. This simple yet very e?ective idea has been generalized in an Apriori-like breadth-?rst computation in ExAMiner [5], and in a FP-growth [10] based depth-?rst computation in FP-Bonsai [7 Since in general depth-?rst approaches are much more e?cient when mining closed itemsets, and since FP-Bonsai has proven to be more e?cient than ExAMiner, we decide here to use a FP-growth based depth?rst strategy for the mining problem MP5. Thus we combine Closet [16], which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining closed frequent itemset, with FPBonsai, which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining frequent itemset with CM constraints 4.2. Pushing Anti-monotone Constraints Anti-monotone constraints CAM can be easily pushed in a Closet computation by using them in the exact same way as the frequency constraint, exploiting the downward closure property of antimonotone constraints. During the computation, as soon as a closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X ered, we can prune X and all its supersets by halting the depth ?rst visit. But whenever, such closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X e.g. bcd in Figure 3\(a some itemsets Y ? X belonging to the same equivalence class and satisfying the constraint may exist \(e.g bd and cd in Figure 3\(a ery such X in a separate list, named Edge, and after the mining we can reconstruct such itemsets Y by means of a simple top-down process, named Backward-Mining, described in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 Backward-Mining Input: Edge, C, CAM , CM C is the set of frequent closed itemsets CAM is the antimonotone constraint CM is a monotone constraint \(if present Output: MP5 1: MP5 = C split Edge by cardinality 2: k = 0 3: for all c ?

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
