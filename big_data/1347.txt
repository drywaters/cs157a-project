  1. Introduction The concept of privacy preserving data mining has been recently proposed in response to the concerns of preserving personal information from data mining algorithms 3,4,5,15,16  Th e r e  h a ve b e e n t w o t y pe s of pr i v a c y  concerning data mining.  The first type of privacy is that the data is altered so that the mining result will preserve certain privacy.  Many techniques have been proposed for this type of output privacy [1,6,7,8,9,17-20,22,25  F o r e x a m pl e   perturbation, blocking, aggregation or merging, swapping and sampling are some alternation methods that have recently been proposed.  The sec ond type of privacy is that 
the data is manipulated so that the mining result is not affected or minimally affected [10,11,12,13,23  For example, the cryptography-based techniques like secure multiparty computation  allow users access to only a subset of data while global data mining results can still be discovered.   The reconstruction-based technique where the original distribution of the data can be reconstructed from the randomized data is another method for this type of input privacy In output privacy, given specific rules to be hidden, many data altering techniques for hiding association 
classification and clustering rules have been proposed However, to specify hidden rules, entire data mining process needs to be executed.  For some applications, we are only interested in hiding certain sensitive predicative rules that contain given items.  A predictive association rule set is the smallest rule set that makes the same prediction as the whole association rule set by confidence priority.  A sensitive predictive rule is a rule in the predictive association rule set that contains sensitive items on the left hand side of the rule.  In this work, we assume that only sensitive items are given and propose two algorithms to modify data in database so that sensitive predicative rules 
containing specified items on the left hand side of rule cannot be inferred through association rule mining.  The proposed algorithms are based on modifying or perturbing the database transactions so that the confidence of the association rules can be reduced.  Examples demonstrating the proposed algorithms are shown The characteristics of the proposed algorithms are analyzed.  The efficiency of the proposed approach is further compared with Saygin etc approach.  It is observed that our approach required less number of databases scanning and prune more number of hidden rules.  However, our approach must hide all rules containing the hidden items on the left hand side, where 
Saygin etc approach can hide any specific rule The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 presents the statement of the problem and the notation used in the paper.  Section 3 presents the proposed algorithms for hiding sensitive predictive association rules that contain the specified items. Section 4 shows some examples of the proposed algorithms.  Section 5 analyses the characteristics of proposed algorithms and further compare with Saygin etc approach.  Concluding remarks and future works are described in section 6 223 0-7803-9093-8/05/$20.00 ©2005 IEEE 


  2. Problem Statement 2.1. Predicative Association Rules  The problem of mining association rules was introduced in [2 L e t           2 1 m i i i I 000\026 000 be a set of literals, called items.  Given a set of transactions D where each transaction T is a set of items such that  I T 000 an association rule is an expression Y X 000 where  I X 000   I Y 000 and  000I 000 000 Y X The X and Y are called respectively the body \(left hand side\ and head \(right hand side\ of the rule.  An example of such a rule is that 90% of customers buy hamburgers also buy Coke.  The 90% here is called the confidence of the rule, which means that 90% of transaction that contains X also contains Y The confidence is calculated as     X Y X 000 The support of the rule is the percentage of transactions that contain both X and Y which is calculated as N Y X   000 where N is the number of transactions in D In other words, the confidence of a rule measures the degree of the correlation between itemsets while the support of a rule measures the significance of the correlation between itemsets.  The problem of mining association rules is to find all rules that are greater than the user-specified Minimum Support Threshold \(MST\ and Minimum Confidence Threshold \(MCT  As an example, for the given database in Table 1, a MST of 60% and a MCT of 70%, four association rules can be found as follows A  B 60%, 75 B  A 60%, 75  A  D 60%, 75 D  A 60%, 100   Table 1: Database D  TID Items ABCD T 1 1101 T 2 0100 T 3 1011 T 4 1100 T 5 1101   However, mining association rules usually generates a large number of rules, most of which are unnecessary for the purpose of prediction.  For example, given itemset for prediction P = {A the rule set that contains only two rules A  B 60%, 75 A  D 60%, 75%\, will generate the same predicted itemset Q = {B, D as the four association rules found from Table 1.  The rule set A  B, A  D is called predictive rule set of P Informally, a predictive association rule set \(or informative rule set\14 can  b e  defined as the smallest rule set that makes the same prediction as the association rule set by confidence priority 2.2. Problem Description  The objective of data mining is to extract hidden or potentially unknown interesting rules or patterns from databases.  However, the objective of privacy preserving data mining is to hide certain sensitive information so that they cannot be discovered through data mining techniques 1,4-12,16 this wo rk we as sum e that o n l y sen s iti v e items are given and propose two algorithms to replace data by unknowns in database so that sensitive predictive association rules cannot be inferred through association rule mining.  More specifically, given a transaction database D  a minimum support threshold, a minimum confidence threshold and a set of sensitive items X the objective is to modify the database D such that no predictive association rules containing X on the left hand side will be discovered The approach of hiding sensitive association rules by replacing data items by unknowns was introduced in Saygin etc [2 As u nkn own s a r e  i nvol ve d i n  t h e  da t a ba s e  the definition of support must be modified.  Instead of a single value for the support of an itemset A, there is a support interval, [minsup\(A\maxsup\(A wh er e the actual support of itemset A can be any value between minsup\(A and maxsup\(A\e minsup\(A\he percentage of the transactions that contain 1s for all the items in A and maxsup\(A\ is the percentage of the transactions that contain either 1 or  for all the items in A.  Similarly, the confidence formula is also modified since it will also have a degree of uncertainty.  Instead of a single value for the confidence of a rule A=>B, there is a confidence interval minconf\(A=>B\axconf\(A=>B wher e t h e actual confidence of a rule A=>B can be any value between minconf\(A=>B\ and maxconf\(A=>B\ Given the minimum and maximum support values of itemsets A 000 B and A, the minimum confidence value for a rule A=>B is minconf\(A=>B\ = minsup\(A 000 B\/maxsup\(A\, and the maximum confidence value is maxconf\(A=>B maxsup\(A 000 B\insup\(A As an example, for the given database in Table 1, a MST of 60%, a MCT of 70%, and a hidden item X  B if transaction T 4 is modified as 100 then the following rule that contain item B on the left hand side will be hidden B  A 40%,60   5 0%,7 5     an d the ru l e  A  B 40%,60   5 0   100   wi l l be l o s t du e t o si de e f f e c t   The following notation will be used in the paper. Each database transaction has three elements: T=<TID list_of_elements, size>.  The TID is the unique identifier of the transaction T and list_of_elements is a list of all items in the database.  However, each element has value 1 if the corresponding item is supported by the transaction and 0 otherwise. Size means the number of elements in the list_of_elements having value 1.  For example, if I   A,B,C a transaction that has the items A, C will be represented as t T1,101,2>.  In addition, a transaction t  supports an itemset I when the elements of t.list_of_elements corresponding to items of I are all set to 1.  A transaction t  partially supports an itemset I when the 224 


 elements are not all set to 1.  For example, if I  A,B,C  111 p T 3  and q T2 1  t h e n we  would say that p  supports  I and q  partially supports  I  3. Proposed Algorithms In order to hide an association rule, we can either decrease its support or its confidence to be smaller than pre-specified minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds.  To decrease the confidence of a rule X=>Y we can either \(1\crease the support of X i.e., the left hand side of the rule, but not support of X 000 Y or \(2\ decrease the support of the itemset X 000 Y For the second case, if we only decrease the support of Y the right hand side of the rule, it would reduce the confidence faster than simply reducing the support of X 000 Y To decrease support of an item, we will modify one item at a time in a selected transaction by changing from 1 to ? and from 0 to ? to increase the support  Based on these two strategies, we propose two datamining algorithms for hiding sensitive predictive association rules, namely I ncrease S upport of LHS  ISL  and D ecrease S upport of R HS DSR The first algorithm tries to increase the support of left hand side of the rule The second algorithm tries to decrease the support of the right hand side of the rule.  The details of the two algorithms are described as follow  Algorithm ISL Input  1\ a source database D   2\MST \(Minimum Support Threshold  3\ MCT \(Minimum Confidence Threshold  4\a set of hidden items X  Output a transformed database D where rules containing X on LHS will be hidden  1 Find large 1-item sets from D  2 For each hidden item x 000 X  3 If x is not a large 1-itemset, then X := X -{x  4.

Even though it is the hidden rules, instead of hidden items, that are specified in [22 we com p ar e t h e number of database scanning and the rules pruned between the two approaches.  For the proposed algorithms, the number of database scanning comes from the calculation of only large one and large two itemsets, as well as transactions in T 6.301605 0.000000 0.000000 6.301605 121.800003 466.640305 Tm 6.301605 0.000000 0.000000 6.301605 130.300003 441.640335 Tm L 9.744400 0.000000 0.000000 9.744400 125.279999 468.080307 Tm 9.744400 0.000000 0.000000 9.744400 133.779999 443.080338 Tm For Saygin etc’s algorithm, the number of database scanning comes from the calculation of all large itemsets, which may include large three or higher itemsets and partial support transactions T No rules are pruned in the Saygin etc’s algorithm  One of the reasons that Saygin etc’s approach does not prune rules is that hidden rules are given in advance and the algorithms try to hide every single rule without checking to see if rules can be pruned after some transactions have been changed  However, our approach needs to hide all rules containing hidden items on the left hand side.  But Saygin etc’s approach can hide some of the rules containing hidden item on the left hand side.  For example, for hidden item A  Saygin etc’s approach can hide A=> B but show A => D  whereas our approach must hide both rules The fourth characteristic we analyze is efficiency comparison of the ISL and DSR algorithms.  One observation we conclude from the examples in section four is that DSR algorithm seems to be more effective when the support count of the hidden item is large.  This is due to when support of right hand side of the rule is large increase support of left hand side usually does not reduce the confidence of the rule.  However, decrease support of right hand side usually decreases the confidence of the rule  11.669998 0.000000 0.000000 11.669998 56.039993 169.940308 Tm 11.669998 0.000000 0.000000 11.669998 64.539993 144.940338 Tm 6.

The proposed algorithms are based on modifying the database transactions using unknowns so that the confidence of the association rules can be reduced.  Examples demonstrating the proposed algorithms are shown.  The item ordering and algorithm ordering characteristics of the proposed algorithms are analyzed.  The efficiency of the proposed approach is further compared with Saygin etc’s [22 I t  was observed that our approach required less number of database scanning and prune more number of hidden rules However, our approach must hide all rules containing the hidden items on the left hand side, where Saygin etc’s approach can hide any specified rule.  Currently we are performing numerical simulation on the time effects and side effects \(the number of lost rules and new rules due to alternation of the database\and will be included in this work.  In the future, we will examine and compare with other alternation techniques for hiding predictive association rules based on current approach  11.669998 0.000000 0.000000 11.669998 304.559998 534.020294 Tm 11.669998 0.000000 0.000000 11.669998 313.059998 509.020325 Tm 7.

some are best for dense type datasets Currently there is no single algorithm exist that shows global best performance on all types of datasets The main limitation of previous algorithms is that they really upon only single strategy and do no combine the best features of multiple strategies for speedup the process of itemset mining In this paper we show that combining the best features of multiple strategies into a single hybrid is more beneficial and efficient than relying upon single strategy Our different experimental results on benchmark datasets show that mining all and maximal frequent itemsets using our hybrid approach is more efficient than existing algorithms and gives global best performance 13 T Uno M Kiyomi H Arimura LCM ver 3 Collaboration of Array Bitmap and Prefix Tree for Frequent Itemset Mining In 1st Int'l Workshop on Open Source Data Mining in conjunction with SIGKDD2005 2005 14 M J Zaki and C Hsiao Charm An efficient algorithm for closed association rule mining In Technical Report 99-10 Computer Science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1999 8 References 1 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc ACMSIGMOD Int'l Conf Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc Int'l Conf Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499 Sept 1994 3 S Bashir A Rauf Baig HybridMiner Mining Maximal Frequent Itemsets using Hybrid Database Representation Appraoch In Proc of 10th IEEE-INMIC conference Karachi Pakistan 2005 4 D Burdick M Calimlim and J Gehrke Mafia A maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transactional databases In Proc ofICDE Conf pp 443-452 2001 5 Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations B Goethals and M.J Zaki eds CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 http:HCEURWS.org/Vol-90 6 K Gouda and M J Zaki Efficiently mining maximal frequent itemsets In ICDM pp 163-170 2001 7 G Grahne and J Zhu Efficiently Using Prefix-trees in Mining Frequent Itemsets In Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2003 8 J Han J Pei and Y Yin Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation In SIGMOD pages 1-12 2000 9 J Liu Y Pan K Wang and J Han Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection In Proc of KDD Conf 2002 10 G Liu H Lu Y Xu and J X Yu Ascending frequency ordered prefix-tree Efficient mining of frequent patterns In DASFAA 2003 11 J Pei J Han H Lu S Nishio S Tang and D Yang HMine Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases In Proc of ICDMConf pp 441.448 2001 12 A Pietracaprina and D Zandolin Mining Frequent Itemsets Using Patricia Tries Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 243 


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type. The pattern-covering operator, denoted as ?p\(c,D all patterns in c representing D. More formally p\(c,D t.a1, ..., t.an true Note that: ?p\(c,D p,D 6. Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
