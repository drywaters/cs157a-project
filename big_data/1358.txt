used in data mining is an example of rule-extraction method In our paper we are interested in if-then rules generated from data with fuzzy attributes rows and columns of data table correspond to objects x 002 X and attributes y 002 Y  respectively Table entries I  x y  are truth degrees to which object x has attribute y  We are interested in rules of the form if A then B  A 003 B  where A and B are collections of attributes with the meaning if an object has all the attributes of A then it has also all attributes of B  Our paper accompanies and 6 where we introduced the notions of v alidity of a rule entailment of rules showed some basic results including the description of a complete and non-redundant set of rules and an algorithm for generating this set The present paper focuses mainly on the following problem A data table with fuzzy attributes can be transformed to a 
table with crisp attributes e.g by discretization We study a relationship between if-then rules obtained from a table with fuzzy attributes and if-then rules of the transformed table with crisp attributes II P RELIMINARIES We use sets of truth degrees equipped with operations logical connectives so that is becomes a complete residuated lattice with a truth-stressing hedge A complete residuated lattice with truth-stressing hedge shortly a hedge 10 is an algebra L  004 L 005  006  007  010  002  0  1 011 such that 004 L 005  006  0  1 011 is a complete lattice with 0 and 1 being the least and greatest element of L  respectively 004 L 007  1 011 is a commutative monoid 
i.e 007 is commutative associative and a 007 1=1 007 a  a for each a 002 L  007 and 010 satisfy so-called adjointness property a 007 b 012 c iff a 012 b 010 c 1 for each a b c 002 L  hedge 002 satisìes 1 002 1  2 a 002 012 a 3  a 010 b  002 012 a 002 010 b 002  4 a 002\002 
 a 002  5 for each a b 002 L  a i 002 L  i 002 I  Elements a of L are called truth degrees 007 and 010 are truth functions of fuzzy conjunction and fuzzy implication Hedge 002 is a truth function of logical connective very true see 10 Properties 5 have natural interpretations e.g 3 can be read if a is very true then a is true 4 can be read if a 010 b is very true and if a is very true then b is very true etc A common choice of L is a structure with L 0   unit interval 005 and 
006 being minimum and maximum 007 being a left-continuous t-norm with the corresponding 010  Three most important pairs of adjoint operations on the unit interval are ukasiewicz a 007 b  max a  b  1  0  a 010 b min\(1  a  b 1  6 G  odel a 007 b min a b   a 010 b  002 1 if a 012 b b otherwise 7 Goguen product a 007 b  a 
 b a 010 b  002 1 if a 012 b b a otherwise 8 In applications we usually need a nite linearly ordered L For instance one can put L   a 0 0 a 1 a n 1 013 0    a 0   a n  with 007 given by a k 007 a l  a max k  l  n 0 and the corresponding 010 given by a 
k 010 a l  a min n  k  l,n   Such an L is called a nite ukasiewicz chain Another possibility is a nite G  odel chain which consists of L and restrictions of G  odel operations on 0   to L  Two boundary cases of truth-stressing hedges are i identity i.e a 002  a  a 002 L  ii globalization a 002  002 1 if a 1  0 otherwise 9 0-7803-9158-6/05/$20.00 © 2005 IEEE The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 1050 


A special case of the complete residuated lattice with hedge is the two-element Boolean algebra 004 0  1   005  006  007  010  002  0  1 011  denoted by 2  which is the structure of truth degrees of the classical logic That is the operations 005  006  007  010 of 2 are the truth functions interpretations of the corresponding logical connectives of the classical logic and 0 002 0  1 002 1  Note that if we prove an assertion for general L  then in particular we obtain a crisp version of this assertion for L being 2  Having L  we deìne usual notions an L set fuzzy set A in universe U is a mapping A  U 010 L  A  u  being interpreted as the degree to which u belongs to A  If U   u 1 u n  then A can be denoted by A   a 1 u 1  a n u n  meaning that A  u i  equals a i for each i 1 n  For brevity we introduce the following convention we write  u  instead of   1 u   and we also omit elements of U whose membership degree is zero For example we write  u 0  5 v  instead of  1 u 0  5 v 0 w   etc Let L U denote the collection of all L sets in U  The operations with L sets are deìned componentwise For instance the intersection of L sets A B 002 L U is an L set A 014 B in U such that  A 014 B  u  A  u  005 B  u  for each u 002 U  etc Binary L relations binary fuzzy relations between X and Y can be thought of as L sets in the universe X  Y  Given A B 002 L U  we deìne a subsethood degree S  A B  003 u 003 U 004 A  u  010 B  u  005  10 which generalizes the classical subsethood relation 013  S  A B  represents a degree to which A is a subset of B  In particular we write A 013 B iff S  A B   As a consequence A 013 B iff A  u  012 B  u  for each u 002 U  In the sequel we will take advantage of one the common methods of representing L sets fuzzy sets by 2 sets ordinary sets for A 002 L U we deìne 015 A 016\002 2 U  L by 015 A 016  004 u a 011\002 U  L  a 012 A  u    11 Described verbally 015 A 016 can be considered as an area under the membership function A  U 010 L For B 002 2 U  L we deìne 017 B 020\002 L U by 017 B 020  u  006  a 002 L 004 u a 011\002 B  12 for each u 002 U  Clearly for each A B 002 2 U  L we have A 013\015\017 A 020\016  13 A 013 B implies 015\017 A 020\016 013 015\017 B 020\016  14 017 A 020  017\015\017 A 020\016\020  15 As a consequence  015\017 020\016  is a closure operator on U  L such that for B  015\017 B 020\016 we have A 013 B iff 017 A 020\013\017 B 020 iff 015\017 A 020\016 013 015\017 B 020\016 16 for each A 002 2 U  L  Observe that 16 does not hold in general if B 021\015\017 B 020\016  I  y        x  I  x y         Fig 1 Data table with fuzzy attributes III F UZZY ATTRIBUTE IMPLICATIONS In crisp case attribute implications were thoroughly investigated see e.g for the rst paper and 7 for further information and references Attribute implications in fuzzy setting were for the rst time studied in The main difference between our approach and that of is that we use as an additional parameter a unary connective 002  and a different approach to pseudointents see later which enables us to obtain a complete and non-redundant basis of attribute implications which by a suitable setting of 002  is also minimal w.r.t its size We comment on the results of in a forthcoming paper A Deìnition validity and basic properties Fuzzy attribute implication  in attributes Y  is an expression A 003 B  where A B 002 L Y  The intended meaning of A 003 B is the following if it is very true that an object has attributes A  then it has also attributes B  For an L set M 002 L Y of attributes we deìne a degree  A 003 B  M 002 L to which A 003 B is valid in M 002 L Y   A 003 B  M  S  A M  002 010 S  B M   17 If M represents attributes of an object x  then  A 003 B  M is the truth degree to which A 003 B holds for x  Fuzzy attribute implications can be used to describe dependencies in data tables with fuzzy attributes Let X and Y be sets of objects and attributes respectively I be an L relation between X and Y  i.e I is a mapping I  X  Y 010 L  004 X Y I 011 is called a data table with fuzzy attributes 004 X Y I 011 represents a table which assigns to each x 002 X and each y 002 Y a truth degree I  x y  002 L to which object x has attribute y  If both X and Y are nite 004 X Y I 011 can be visualized as in Fig 1 For L sets A 002 L X  B 002 L Y i.e A is an L set of objects B is an L set of attributes we deìne L sets A 004 002 L Y  L set of attributes B 005 002 L X  L set of objects by A 004  y  003 x 003 X 004 A  x  002 010 I  x y  005  18 B 005  x  003 y 003 Y 004 B  y  010 I  x y  005  19 We put B  X 002 Y,I  004 A B 011\002 L X  L Y  A 004  B B 005  A  and deìne for 004 A 1 B 1 011  004 A 2 B 2 011\002B  X 002 Y,I  a binary relation 012 by 004 A 1 B 1 011\012\004 A 2 B 2 011 iff A 1 013 A 2 or iff B 2 013 B 1  both ways are equivalent Operators 005  004 induced by 004 X Y I 011 form so-called Galois connection with hedge see The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 1051 


The structure 004B  X 002 Y,I   012\011 is called a fuzzy concept lattice induced by 004 X Y I 011  The elements 004 A B 011 of B  X 002 Y,I  are naturally interpreted as concepts clusters hidden in the input data represented by I  Namely A 004  B and B 005  A say that B is the collection of all attributes shared by all objects from A  and A is the collection of all objects sharing all attributes from B  Note that these conditions represent exactly the deìnition of a concept as developed in the so-called PortRoyal logic A and B are called the extent and the intent of the concept 004 A B 011  respectively and represent the collection of all objects and all attributes covered by the particular concept Furthermore 012 models the natural subconcept-superconcept hierarchyÑconcept 004 A 1 B 1 011 is a subconcept of 004 A 2 B 2 011 iff each object from A 1 belongs to A 2 dually for attributes Now we deìne a validity degree of fuzzy attribute implications in data tables and intents of fuzzy concept lattices First for a set M\013 L Y i.e M is an ordinary set of L sets we deìne a degree  A 003 B  M 002 L to which A 003 B holds in M by  A 003 B  M  003 M 003M  A 003 B  M  20 A degree  A 003 B  006 X,Y,I 007 002 L to which A 003 B holds in  each row of  004 X Y I 011 is deìned by  A 003 B  006 X,Y,I 007   A 003 B  M  21 where M   x  004  x 002 X   By deìnition each  x  004 represents all the attributes of x 002 X  i.e  x  004 represents a row labeled x  in the data table 004 X Y I 011  For each 004 X Y I 011 we consider a set Int X 002 Y,I  013 L Y of all intents of concepts of B  X 002 Y,I   i.e Int X 002 Y,I   B 002 L Y 004 A B 011\002B  X 002 Y,I  for some A 002 L X   Since M 002 L Y is an intent of some concept of B  X 002 Y,I  iff M  M 005\004 wehave Int X 002 Y,I   M 002 L Y  M  M 005\004   A degree  A 003 B  B  X 002 Y,I  002 L to which A 003 B holds in intents of B  X 002 Y,I  is deìned by  A 003 B  B  X 002 Y,I    A 003 B  Int X 002 Y,I   22 The following lemma connects the degree to which A 003 B holds in 004 X Y I 011  the degree to which A 003 B holds in intents of B  X 002 Y,I   and the degree of subsethood of B in A 005\004  Lemma 1 Let 004 X Y I 011 be a data table with fuzzy attributes Then  A 003 B  006 X,Y,I 007   A 003 B  B  X 002 Y,I   S  B A 005\004  for each fuzzy attribute implication A 003 B  Proof See B Implication bases and pseudo-intents First fuzzy attribute implications describe particular dependencies in data The number of attribute implications valid in data can be considerably large including trivial implications carrying no interesting information Therefore we are interested in minimal sets of implications from which all the valid implications follow Second fuzzy attribute implications can be seen as an alternative way to describe a fuzzy concept lattice In case of large and dense data tables with fuzzy attributes the corresponding fuzzy concept lattices are usually large and then practically of no use for the exploration of the structure of input data From this point of view we are interested in nding a minimal set of implications which completely describe the concept lattice In what follows we present details Let 004 X Y I 011 be a data table with fuzzy attributes and let T be a set of fuzzy attribute implications M 002 L Y is called a model of T if  A 003 B  M 1 for each A 003 B 002 T  The set of all models of T is denoted by Mod T   i.e Mod T   M 002 L Y  M is a model of T   23 A degree  A 003 B  T 002 L to which A 003 B semantically follows from T is deìned by  A 003 B  T   A 003 B  Mod T   24 T is called complete with respect to 004 X Y I 011 if  A 003 B  T   A 003 B  006 X,Y,I 007 for each A 003 B If T is complete and each proper subset of T is not complete then T is called nonredundant basis A complete T is redundant if it is not a non-redundant basis The following assertion shows that the models of a complete set of fuzzy attribute implications are exactly the intents of the corresponding fuzzy concept lattice Theorem 2 T is complete iff Mod T nt X 002 Y,I   Proof See Therefore we are interested in nding non-redundant bases One approach to obtain non-redundant bases is via so-called pseudo-intents Given 004 X Y I 011  P\013 L Y is called a system of pseudointents of 004 X Y I 011 if for each P 002 L Y we have P 002P iff P 022  P 005\004 and  Q 003 Q 005\004  P 1 for each Q 002P with Q 022  P  If 002 is globalization and if Y is nite then for each 004 X Y I 011 there exists a unique system of pseudo-intents this is not so for the other hedges in general From now on let X and Y be nite and let L be nite and linearly ordered Theorem 3 Let P be a system of pseudo-intents and put T   P 003 P 005\004  P 002P  25 Then T is non-redundant basis If 002 is globalization then T is minimal and it can be computed with polynomial time delay Proof See 6 IV R EDUCTION TO THE CRISP CASE First we show that in certain cases we can express the validity of fuzzy attribute implications in a given data table with fuzzy attributes by a validity of other attribute implications in a data table with crisp attributes Later on we show that it is also possible to nd a complete set of implications by the reduction to the crisp case However this method is not so efìcient as generating fuzzy attribute implications directly from the original data table with fuzzy attributes The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 1052

attributes For brevity we denote attributes 004 y a 011\002 Y  L by y a  Example Let L be a three-element ukasiewicz chain such that L consists of L   0  0  5  1   0  0  5  1  endowed with 007  010 deìned by 6 Let X   v w x   Y   y z   I and the corresponding I 010 are depicted in Table I Recall that 004 X Y I 011 induces a couple of operators 005  004 and so does 004 X Y  L I 010 011  The operators induced by 004 X Y  L I 010 011 will be denoted 002  003  It is easily seen that  1 x  004  017 x  003 020 and  x  003  015\017 x  003 020\016  015 1 x  004 016 for each x 002 X  Described verbally each row of the input data table 004 X Y I 011 can be obtained using 017   020 from the corresponding row of the data table 004 X Y  L I 010 011 and vice versa Moreover one can prove the following Lemma 4 Let A 002 2 Y  L and B 002 L Y  Then A 002\003  015\017 A 002\003 020\016  017 A 020 005\004  017 A 002\003 020  015 B 016 002\003  015 B 005\004 016  27 Proof See From the viewpoint of the concepts hidden in the input data 004 X Y I 011 and 004 X Y  L I 010 011 represent the same information if P is an intent of 004 X Y I 011  then 015 P 016 is an intent of 004 X Y  L I 010 011  analogously if P is an intent of 004 X Y  L I 010 011  then 017 P 020 is an intent of 004 X Y I 011  As a consequence B  X 002 Y,I  is isomorphic to B  X Y  L I 010   see For an implication A 003 B with both antecedent A and consequent B being fuzzy sets one may consider a corresponding implication 015 A 016\003\015 B 016 the antecedent and consequent of which are both crisp sets On the one hand one can evaluate A 003 B in 004 X Y I 011  On the other hand 015 A 016\003\015 B 016 can be evaluated in 004 X Y  L I 010 011  The following assertions show that doing so A 003 B is fully true i.e

Proof Consequence of Lemma 1 and Lemma 5 Now we turn our attention to nding a system of implications which is complete with respect to 004 X Y I 011 and which can be obtained from the crisp counterpart of 004 X Y I 011 If P is a system of classical pseudo-intents of 004 X Y  L I 010 011  then  P 003 P 002\003  P 002P is a minimal non-redundant basis of 004 X Y  L I 010 011 this is a consequence of the classical results  which are no w a particular case for L being 2  see In the following we show that 017 P 020\003\017 P 002\003 020 P 002P is complete with respect to 004 X Y I 011  Lemma 7 Let T  015\017 P 020\016 003 015\017 P 020\016 002\003  P 002P  where P is a system of pseudo-intents of 004 X Y  L I 010 011  Then for each M 002 2 Y  L with M  015\017 M 020\016 we have that M is an intent of 004 X Y  L I 010 011 iff M is a model of T  Proof  003  Let M be an intent i.e M  M 002\003 If 015\017 P 020\016 013 M for P 002P then 015\017 P 020\016 002\003 013 M 002\003  M  That is 015\017 P 020\016 003 015\017 P 020\016 002\003  M 1  which immediately gives that M is a model of T   023  Let M be a model of T  That is for each P 002P we have that 015\017 P 020\016 013 M implies 015\017 P 020\016 002\003 013 M  First observe that 015\017 P 020\016 002\003  015\017 P 020 005\004 016  015\017 P 002\003 020\016  P 002\003 by 27 Since M  015\017 M 020\016  16 gives 015\017 P 020\016 013 M iff P 013 M  That is for each P 002P we have if P 013 M then P 002\003 013 M  Therefore M is a model of  P 003 P 002\003  P 002P  i.e M is an intent of 004 X Y  L I 010 011 by Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 applied for L being 2  Theorem 8 Suppose P is a system of pseudo-intents of 004 X Y  L I 010 011  Then T c  017 P 020\003\017 P 020 005\004  P 002P 30 is a set of fuzzy

order to show that M is an intent it sufìces to show that M 005\004  M  Since M is a model of T c wehave 017 P 020\003\017 P 020 005\004  M 1 for each P 002P  Therefore 015\017 P 020\016 003 015\017 P

Structural Model  After the measurement model specification, we analyze the structural model. The squared multiple correlations \(R 2 xpress the significance of the four endogenous variables. The corresponding t-values show the level of significance using the magnitude of the standardized parameter estimates between constructs. The path coefficients in the research model are significant as shown in Figure 2  The explanatory power of the R≤ is classified by Chin bs t a n t i a l e x pres s i v en e s s f o r t h e  research model could be estimated by an R≤ over 0.67. An average effect stands for R≤-values between 0.67 and 0.34. The explanatory power is weak for an R≤ between 0.34 and 0.19 and overall not relevant for R≤-values under 0.19 [1    Figure 2: Structural model validation   Therefore R≤ of our research model for the intention to use self- and e-assessment can be categorized as substantial expressive for perceived usefulness and as an average effect for intention  4.4. Results  The results of our empirical research based on our explorative case study is that the intention to use self and e-assessments can be explained by Davis perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use Furthermore antecedents of perceived usefulness are perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings derived of the MATH e ll as th e [36]. Statistical  support can be provided for all the hypothesized relations between constructs except of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness  5. Limitations  As with any work in a new field of research relevant literature about self- and e-assessments to build on is almost nonexistent. Unfortunately the operationalization of "perceived cost and time savings" as well as perceived quality improvements  in this paper could consequently not build on earlier work too much so we had to derive them of the MATH m  w e ll as t h e UT A U T  36   As with any empirical field study, this work has limitations. It is important to note that we have build an explorative model to examine the acceptance of self- and e-assessments. As this study provides support for a significant influence of PU and PEOU Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
