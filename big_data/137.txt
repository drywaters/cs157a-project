Research on Changes of E-shopper Behavior in the Internet Environment WANG Chong LI Yi-Jun YE Qiang School of Management Harbin Institute of Technology P.R.China 150001 Abstract In the Internet shopping environment changes of customer's needs grow increasingly outstanding For discovering the changes the paper mines the transaction databases of different time periods by using association rule discovery and extracts the association rules and discovers the changes in network customer behavior by comparison and analysis between the two sets of association rules This paper presents a new algorithm that contains the first support the second support and Rel-confidence The algorithm solves the problem of the present algorithms cannot 
discover association rules with infrequent data items And according to the changes of network customer's behavior robust pattern appearing pattern and unexpected change are presented to measure the changes Keywords Network customer Association rule Support Data item Behavior Change 1 Introduction With the development of electronic commerce in the Internet companies have changed the way they connect to and deal with their customers and partners Businesses hence could overcome the space and time barriers and are now capable of serving customers electronically and intelligently However marketers face the challenge of a constantly evolving market where customer needs are changing all the time In such an environment 
a successful marketer must understand changes in customer needs and how those needs change in time and accordingly develop more appropriate marketing strategies to satisfy customers needs in order to survive and gain a competitive advantage Change mining can enable market analysts to better understand changes in customer needs and how those needs change Change mining is more appropriate in dynamic Internet business environments However relatively little research has focused on mining changes in databases collected over timeE'l Data mining one of the most popular techniques have mostly been adopted to generate predictions and describe behaviors from enterprise databases in support of 
making better decisions 21 Data mining can discover potentially significant patterns and rules underlying the database by automatic or semi-automatic exploration and analysis on large amounts of data items set in a database 3 The patterns and rules mainly include knowledge rules constraints and regularities and are mostly the habits of purchasing and other consumers behavior During the past decade there have been a variety of significant developments Some of the developments are implemented in customized service to develop customer relationship 4 For example businesses can get to know customers wants and needs by utilizing data mining 
technology to find potential information and accordingly develop more appropriate marketing strategies to attract and retain customers in electronic commerce Liu et al devised a method of change mining in the context of decision trees for predicting changes in customer behavior Since decision tree is a classification-based approach it cannot detect complete sets of changes Association rules mining that was first proposed by Agrawal and Srikant can discover correlations of events which can be represented as probabilistic rules 5 Correlation of events means those events are frequently observed together Association rule is represented by X and Y where X and Y are a set of items The rule 
means that the transaction records in database that contain X tend to contain Y Association rule discovery is one of data mining techniques widely used in analyzing the correlation between product items purchased by customers 6 Therefore Song et al 7 considered that association rules discovery could be applied to identify the correlations between customer profiles represented by demographic variables and purchased products by examining customer and product databases And Song employed an approach based on association rules to identify changes in customer behavior So far a good number of efficient algorithms for extracting association rules have been proposed 8][9][10][11 However there are many shortcomings 
for the algorithms in the efficiency In the existing algorithms for discovering the association rules the support is unique throughout the whole database 12 and they assume that each data included in the database occurs in a similar frequency 13 In reality however the data items may occur either relatively frequently or not according to the characteristics of the database and its frequency in the database does not satisfy the minimum support but appears associated with the specific data in high proportion of its frequency Nevertheless the existing association rule discovery techniques do not consider the occurrence frequency pattern of data 
and discover the association rules using the same support on the whole data so the rules associating with infrequent data cannot be discovered In addition to most previous customer behavior studies applied customer demographic variables to analyze customer behavior However valuable customer behavioral variables such as recency frequency and monetary can be used to differentiate customer contributions to a business To solve the problems above in this paper a new algorithm of discovering association rules that contain the first support the second support and Rel-confidence is presented which not only is applicable to excavation 68  


of the frequent data item and but also is applicable to infrequent data item And then two transaction databases at different time periods are mined based on the algorithm The changes in e-shopper behavior are identified by comparison and analysis between the two sets of association rules generated from two databases of different time periods This paper is organized as follows Section 2 formulates the algorithm how to discover frequent items from database and presents the algorithm Section 3 presents analysis on the changes in E-shopper behavior basing on the discovered association rules Section 4 illustrates an example and mines the changes in E-shopper behavior Section 5 presents summary and conclusions 2 Formulation of the algorithm To solve the problem of infrequent data are hardly discovered in the existing association rule discovery methods the first support the second support Rel-confidence and min-confidence are set in the algorithm The first support is critical value of the user-specified support used in the process of frequent itemsets discovery The second support is critical value of the user-specified support in the process of significant infrequent itemsets discovery Rel-confidence is set to discover significant infrequent data items that co-occur with the specific data in high proportion of its frequency and is determined by candidate itemset il i2   ikThe second support works with Rel-confidence together to generate semi-frequent itemsets from candidate itemsets Correlation between the first support and the second support is subject to the following inequality 1 stsupport>2ndsupport 1 The first support and the second support are set so that the condition 1st support  2nd support is satisfied If the expression of inequality is not satisfied redundant rules can be generated or the rare items may not be discovered Rel-confidence is defined as follows If a database is defined as the data set I il i2 im and the support of the data item i is expressed as sup\(i  Rel-confidence the maximum confidence between the data in the candidate itemset Jil i2   ik is Rel-confidence il i2 I ik  max{sup\(i1 i2  1k SUp\(iA SUp\(i1 i2 S  SUp\(i1 i2  I ik ik 2 Rel-confidence is between 0 and 1 and is determined by selecting the largest one among the con-fidence values for the candidate itemset against each data item Transaction database usually is composed of two groups of data items One group includes frequent data items that satisfy the first support and the other group includes rare data items that do not satisfy the first support Firstly the customers information and transactions are recorded in the database The proposed data mining procedure is then applied to analyze customers purchase records Each data item in database is inserted into C1 1-candidate itemsets when the algorithm program scans database To generate L1 frequent 1-itemsets each 1-candidate itemset that satisfies the first support or the second support is inserted into L1 frequent 1itemsets C2 2candidate itemsets are constructed by joining two items from frequent 1itemsets And then count of support is made for each 2-candidate itemset il i2 2-candidate itemset is inserted into L2 frequent 2itemsets if it satisfies the first support For 2-candidate itemset that do not satisfy the first support but satisfy the second support calculation of the Rel-confidence of ii i2   ik is made If the Rel-confidence is greater than or equal to the min confidence specified by user the 2-candidate itemset is considered as semi-frequent itemset and also is inserted into L2 frequent 2itemsets otherwise is deleted Consequently frequent 2itemsets that contain significant infrequent data itemsets are constructed The process repeats until the candidate itemsets cannot be generated any more The overall process of rules discovery is as shown in Fig 1 Suppose frequent k-itemset il i2 k ik is the final frequent itemset that cannot generate candidate itemsets and then association rules are discovered by calculating confidence of il i2  ik and comparing that with min-confidence specified by user IScans transactions database and generates 1-candidate Fig.1 The overall process of rules discovery K-frequent itemsets where k is the number of the 69  4 i2

then Rt2 is an unexpected consequent change with respect to Rt  Moreover if the consequent parts of RtV and Rt2 are similar but their conditional parts are different then Rt2 is an unexpected conditional change with respect to Rti  The patterns of customer behavior reflect the associations between customer attributes and their purchased products Therefore the conditional part of association rule takes the form of customer profile presented by demographic variables and customer behavioral variables While the consequent part denotes the product purchased by customers Unexpected consequent patterns indicate that customers with the same characteristics no longer purchase the same products and shift their purchasing behavior or buy different products Consequently marketing decision makers can promote new products based on the projection of unexpected purchasing rules or can strengthen their marketing efforts to retain customers Unexpected conditional patterns indicate changes occurring in the target customers of products and consumer group of specific products has been changed to another group 4 Mining association rules E-shoppers are segmented into four clusters in terms of in terms of average purchase expenditure monetary and purchase frequency 16 These four customer groups include best customers frequent customers spenders and uncertain customers as illustrated in Fig 2 In the four clusters of e-shoppers best customers represent the most valuable customers with higher purchase frequency and monetary expenditure while spenders and uncertain customers represent peripheral customers whose purchase frequency and monetary expenditure are lower When recency is used for cross analysis of the four customer clusters spenders and uncertain customers have not made regular purchases recently Meanwhile best customers consist of customers who have recently made regular purchases and also have higher average purchase size and purchase frequency Therefore best customers are concluded to be the most valuable for the business In this study best customers are considered as the target object to be mined changes in purchase behavior Monetary A Fig.2 4 clusters of e-shoppers Frequency A record for transaction data usually includes following attributes transactional ID customer name gender age product name quantity and date etc To illustrate the process for mining changes in e-shoppers behavior two databases of different time periods for e-shoppers buying products is as shown in Tab.land Tab.2 The two given database includes ten transactional records that has four attributes a b c d and e represent five different products respectively Tab.1 Transaction database at period ti TID Name Sex Age Product 1 CN1 female  30 ABC 2 CN2 male 30 50 C D 3 CN3 male  30 ABCD 4 CN4 male E 5 CN5 female 50 C E 6 CN6 male 30 CDE 7 CN7 male 30 AB 8 CN8 male 30 50 C D E 9 CN9 male  30 AB 10 CN1O female 30 50 C D E 30 ABE Tab.2 Transaction database at period t2 TID Name Sex Age Product 1 CNII male 30-50 A BC 2 CN12 female  30 CD 3 CN13 female 30 50 ABCD 4 CN14 female 50 E 5 CN15 male 30 50 CE 6 CN16 female 30 50 C D E 7 CN17 female ABE 8 CN18 female 30 C D E 9 CN19 female 30 50 BE 10 CN20 male 30 ACDE 30 50 ABE Transaction database at period tl is transformed into Tab.3 in order to discover association rules In Tab.3 M and F represent male and female respectively and Al A2 and A3 represent 30 30 50 and 50 respectively The first support is set to 4 400 o and the second supports to 2\(20 and min-confidence is set to 500/O The process for extracting association rules on table 3 is as follows Tab.3 Data items in transaction database at period ti TID Sex Age Product 1 F al ABC 2 M a2 CD 3 M al ABCDE 4 M a3 C E 5 F al CDE 6 M al AB 7 M a2 CDE 8 M al ABD 9 M a2 CDE 10 F al ABE The set of data items in the transactions database I  m f al a2 a3 a b c d e are inserted into Cl 1-candidate itemsets Support for each item is as shown 71

5 Conclusion In this study an novel algorithm that contains the first support the second support and Rel-confidence is proposed to discover association rules for both frequent data items and significant rare data items that appear infrequently in the database but are highly associated with specific data Furthermore based on the extracted association rules the changes in e-shoppers purchase behavior are analyzed by comparison between two sets of association rules generated from two databases of different time periods Consequently potentially useful information is acquired to direct marketing decisions References I]Liu B Hsu W Mining changes for real-life applications[A Second International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery[C 2000 337-346 2]Chen M S Han J Data mining an overview from a database perspective J IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 1996 8\(6 866-883 3]Kleissner C Data mining for the enterprise[A Proceedings of the 31 st international conference on system science[C Hawaii 1998 295-304 4 Schafer J B Konstan E-commerce recommendation application J Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 2001 125-153 5]Giudici P Passerone G Data mining of association structures to model consumer behavior[J Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 2002 38 6]Changchien S Mining association rules procedures to support on-line recommendation by customers and products fragmentation[J Expert Systems with Applications 2001 20\(4 7]Song H Kim J Mining the change of customer behavior in an Internet shopping mall J Expert System with Applications 2001 21\(3 8]Agrawal R Srikant R Fast algorithms for mining association rules[A In Proceedings of the International Conference on Very Large Data Bases C 1995 407-419 9]Anand S Patrick A A data mining methodology for cross-sales J Knowledge-Based Systems 1998 10 10]Mastsuzawa H Fukuda T Mining structured association patterns from databases A In Proceeding of the 4th Pacific-Asia Conference[C PAKDD 2000 233-244 11 Goulbourne G Coenen F Algorithms for computing association rules using a partial-support tree[J Knowledge-Based Systems 2000 13 3 141-149 12]Agrawal R Imielinski T Swami A Mining association rules between sets of items in large database[A In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Conference[C 1993 156-165 73

For the smallest required length  2 the percentage of too short rankings was similar for e-commerce and WUT  4.2 and 11%, respectively \(Fig. 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Required length of recommendation list P er ce n ta g e o f p ag es WUT E-commerce Figure 5.

Our solution to this problem is the extension of direct ranking lists with indirect and complex ones. We tested the contribution of pages with too short rankings which were successfully extended with complex rules within all pages with short rankings. In order to do this, we took the number of pages with too short direct rankings for which complex ranking list was longer than direct one, for a required list length and next we divided it by the total number of pages with too short direct rankings. The obtained results were very similar for indirect and complex rules. They show how much short direct ranking lists can be extended with indirect or complex ones \(Fig. 6 percentage started from 97.5% for e-commerce and 70.1 for WUT \(for 2-item rankings commerce and 95.1% for WUT This definitely emphasizes the usefulness of complex and in consequence indirect association rules 60 70 80 90 100 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Required length of recommendation list P er ce n

Do Recommendation Ranking Lists only Confirm Existing Hyperlinks A vital question one can ask is whether recommendation ranking lists only confirm existing hyperlinks or maybe they add new knowledge as well. If all they did was confirm the existing structure of hyperlinks on a site the recommendations offered to a user might not be interesting to them In order to test if ranking lists add anything new, the content of the WUT site was downloaded. From it information about all hyperlinks on each page was extracted Having the structure of the site we were able to assess recommendation lists in the following way: the number of common items in hyperlink sets and ranking lists cut at various lengths was divided by the ranking length i.e. the required length or the actual length if it was smaller than the required length. Such calculations were performed for direct, indirect and complex recommendation lists, Fig. 7 The results for direct, indirect and complex rankings for very short lists \(1 and 2 items 27.1%, 4.6% and 11.7% respectively for 1 item. The same is true for 20-item long lists: 19.9%, 19% and 11.7% respectively. This indicates that for very short indirect and complex rankings \(up to 2 pages 20 items and more existing hyperlinks and add new potentially useful knowledge 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1 2 3 5 10 20 Ranking lenght P er ce n ta g e o f ra n k in g i te m s Direct Indirect Complex Figure 7.

Assessment of Hyperlinks by Association Rules Another application of direct, indirect and complex rules may be the assessment of hyperlinks on a site. We can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been 


can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been placed appropriately by analyzing significant navigational patterns \(association rules In our experiments the percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by rules was calculated by dividing the number of common items in hyperlink sets and whole ranking lists for a given page, by the number of hyperlinks on the page separately for direct, indirect and complex rules \(Fig. 8 Note that the number of hyperlinks was put in the denominator as opposed to calculations in section 7.4 where it was ranking length 48 89%87 0 20 40 60 80 100 direct indirect complex Figure 8. The average percentage of all hyperlinks confirmed by rules Proceedings of the 2005 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and  Applications \(ISDA  05 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE The average percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by direct rules amounted to only 48%, probably because there were too few of them. Indirect and complex rules, on the other hand, confirmed many more hyperlinks  87% and 89%, respectively, due to their larger quantity. These relatively great values that we received may have resulted from the enormous differences between the average number of hyperlinks on a page  10 and the average ranking length: 51, 177, 180 for direct, indirect and complex rules respectively. Concluding, indirect and complex rules appear to be better at assessing the usefulness of hyperlinks compared to direct rules Note that in any case at least 11% of hyperlinks were not confirmed by any rule, so they may be recommended to be removed from the content of pages 8. Conclusions and future work Complex rules combining both direct and indirect rules usually increase the length of rankings compared to those based on direct associations. This helps overcome the problem of a multitude of pages with too short rankings Fig. 5 quested ranking length \(Fig. 6 rules substantially change the order of ranking lists \(Fig. 2 and 3 greater extent only confirm hyperlinks existing on web pages compared to lists extracted from complex rules, for short and long ranking lengths \(Fig. 7 of rules, especially indirect and complex ones, can be useful for the assessment of hyperlinks Concluding, far more diverse indirect rules can significantly improve potential value of recommendation. Nevertheless, to confirm the usefulness of indirect rules for end users, some tedious tests with their participation are required Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to thank Marcin Pilarczyk for providing cleansed data about hyperlinks on WUT pages 9.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
