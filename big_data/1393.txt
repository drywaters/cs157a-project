But it causes the sharp boundary problem in handling databases with quantitative attributes. To solve the problem, a method is presented that integrates fuzzy sets and genetic algorithm in anomaly detection. Encoding the parameters of membership functions into an individual chromosome mining techniques into the genetic optimization, an optimal parameter-set can be obtained. With the use of the parameter-set in anomaly detection, the normal states of protected system can be differentiated from the anomalous states to the largest extent, and the veracity of anomaly detection is improved significantly Keywords anomaly detection; fuzzy data mining; genetic algorithm 1. Introduction As network-based computer systems play increasingly vital roles in modern society, security of network systems has become more important than ever before. Intrusion detection System \(IDS technology to help protect these systems. IDS approaches can be divided into two main categories: misuse detection and anomaly detection[1]. Comparatively, anomaly detection is more reliable for the systems with rigorous security requirement because it can detect unknown attacks or new types of intrusions Anomaly detection is based on an assumption that attacks are different from  normal  legitimate can therefore be detected by identifying these differences. It firstly defines the normal profile of protected system by a series of characteristic parameters and thresholds. Then in real time detection process, it compares the current system state with the normal profile to identify the degree of the difference between them. A higher degree than the predefined threshold means the system is in abnormal state Thus detecting intrusion is in fact detecting the degree of deviations[2] of current system from the normal profile In order to characterize normal profile, anomaly detection approaches usually have to handle extensive  training sets  of system event records, which is a difficult task in system design. Therefore Wenke Lee et.al presented using data mining technology to extract patterns in IDS[3][4 Generally, data mining technology is more effective in handling the Boolean attributes. For the database with quantitative attributes, the attribute domain should be divided into several discrete intervals in the preprocess of data mining, which causes the problem known as  sharp boundary  To solve the problem, Susan M. applied fuzzy set theory in data mining, namely fuzzy data mining[5]. In 6], the problem  sharp boundary  and fuzzy data mining methods have been introduced. However, applying fuzzy set in data mining causes another problem that defining membership functions always depends heavily upon the experts  domain knowledge, which is a great disadvantage of fuzzy data mining In this paper, we integrate fuzzy sets and genetic algorithm in anomaly detection and present an approach of anomaly detection based on fuzzy data mining and genetic 


anomaly detection based on fuzzy data mining and genetic optimization. Parameters of membership functions are arranged into a sequential parameter-set, which is encoded into an individual \(chromosome algorithm to find the optimal parameter-set. The subsequent sections are organized as follows. Section 2 describes the fuzzy data mining methods used in anomaly detection Section 3 presents the approach that applies genetic algorithm to optimize the parameter-set of membership functions. Section 4 describes experiments on anomaly detection to network traffic and results analysis Conclusions and plans for future work are given in the last section 0-7803-9091-1/05/$20.00  2005 IEEE 1987 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  2. Fuzzy Data Mining in Anomaly Detection 2.1. Anomaly Detection Based on Data Mining The application of data mining in anomaly detection includes the following steps I state. The attributes of the database consist of Multi-level parameters monitored in the protected system including user-level, system-level, process-level, packet-level and etc Collecting values of the parameters in various time-domains with system in normal state, we can establish normal state database II association rule-set S1 that represents the normal profile of the protected system III parameters to establish transient state database. Mine the transient state database and extract the association rule-set S2 that represents the transient profile of the protected system IV  similarity\(S1, S2 we can evaluate the deviation degree of the real-time state and the normal state to detect intrusions in the protected system Given two association rules R1:X  Y,c,s and R2:X  Y  c  s  when X=X  and Y=Y  the similarity of the two rules can be calculated by the formula 1 2   0,1 max c c s s similarity R R c s   1 When X?X  or Y?Y  the similarity of the rules will be zero For two given rule sets S1 and S2, the similarity of the sets is 2 1 2 1 2   s similarity S S S S 2 where 1 1 2 2 1 2 


1 2 R S R S s similarity R R   S1?and?S2 are respectively the number of rules in S1 and S2 Obviously, we have 0?similarity\(S1, S2 value of similarity\(S1, S2 threshold means the current system is in an abnormal state 2.2. Mining Fuzzy Association Rules Mining association rules is an important data mining approach widely used in intrusion detection to discover hidden relationship among attributes of tables in databases The relationship can be defined as an association rule represented as: X  Y [s?c], where X={x1,x2  xp} and Y={y1,y2  yq} are subsets of attributes set in database, and X?Y=?, s and c are respectively the support degree and the confidence degree A well known mining association rules algorithm Apriori, was presented by Agrawal and Srikant[8] to mine single-dimensional Boolean association rules from databases. However, we always need to mine quantitative attribute in intrusion detection. Kuok.Fu et.al integrated fuzzy logic with association rules to handle numerical values in their papers. With fuzzy logic, a certain attribute w is replaced by a fuzzy set consisting of several fuzzy attributes wfuzzy={w1,w2  wp} which are defined by corresponding membership function set 1 2  pw w w w F f f f   iw vote d f d The membership degree represents the vote for the fuzzy attribute wi of a certain value d. Accordingly, the form of association rules changes to lt;X,A&gt  lt;Y,B&gt; [c,s],                      \(3 where 1 2  px x x A w w w= ? ? ?  and  are respectively the fuzzy set associated with X and Y 1 2 y y yqB w w w An appropriate membership function is the basis of quantitative analysis on fuzzy attributes and plays a key role in fuzzy mathematics. However, defining membership function is an uncertain process affected by subjective factors of human being, including cognition degree of fuzzy attributes, experience, even the mentation of experts. The most widely used functions include Z-shaped functions S-shaped functions and ? -shaped functions. A representation of standard membership functions F is shown in figure 1   Z ?

Application of Genetic Algorithm 3.1.  Genetic Algorithm Genetic algorithm is a family of computational models based on principles of evolution and natural selection[9]. It is mainly used to find optimal solutions to a specific problem.  In genetic algorithm, a chromosome represents an element in solution space and the fitness of it is calculated by an evaluation function. The process of genetic algorithm begins with a randomly selected population of chromosomes. During evaluation, better chromosomes with higher fitness will be reproduced and mutated while less fit ones will be eliminated. The selection of chromosomes for survival and combination is biased towards the fittest chromosomes The main steps of genetic algorithm include I genes initial population II III generation of chromosomes by using the crossover and mutations operators IV stopped according to the predefined termination criteria. If not, repeat steps II reached 3.2. Optimizing Membership Function in Anomaly Detection As mentioned above, membership functions can be optimized by genetic algorithm. Here we use Function F shown in figure 1 as an instant to present the approach of optimizing membership functions with genetic algorithm 3.2.1.  Encoding Function F is controlled by 6 parameters. We encode each parameter respectively with a gene consisting of  0   and  1  characters and links the genes as a parameter-chain Generally, a database involves several quantitative attributes, mapping respective membership function and parameter-chain. Linking all the chains, we get a chromosome as an individual. For example, given two quantitative attributes, the chromosome is a linkage of 12 parameters encoded with 0/1 characters as shown in figure 2      


      Before encoding, we need firstly find out the span of each parameter \(variable in genetic algorithm  Apparently, xmin and xmax are respectively the minimum and maximum in the dataset contributing to the attribute Generally, a larger span of parameter will cause a longer chromosome, hence an exponential doubling of computing cost. Thus we can shorten the span to some extent according to restriction among parameters themselves. For function F, the parameters should meet the inequation a  lt;b-d&lt;c  lt;b&lt;a&lt;b+d&lt;c                    \(4 Evaluating the approximately value of parameters in fittest chromosome, we set the span of each parameters as xmax - xmin xmin?a  xmin+xmax 7xmin+xmax 3xmin+5xmax Consequently the size of gene- segment \(represents an encoded parameter shortened span. Finally, we encode each parameter and generate the initial population 3.2.2.  Fitness Function A fitness function is used to quantify the optimality of a solution \(that is, a chromosome In anomaly detection, the fittest membership function should be capable to minimize the similarity of rule-set S profile of normal state profile of anomalous state Let P={x1,x2  xn} be the parameter-set of all membership functions, xi \(1?i?n of parameters. Thus we can define the fitness function as f\(P P,S1,S2 generated by fuzzy data mining using parameter-set P respectively with system in normal state and anomalous state In addition, because the parameter-set P should meet the inequation \(4 meet the inequation are infeasible solutions and should be punished. Consequently the final fitness function is defined as the following 1 2   1 similarity P S S f P 0 if   P meet \(4 otherwise     5 a  c  b d a c a  c  b d a c 1011010 001101  001101   Figure 2. Encoding parameters of function F 1989 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  3.2.3.  Genetic Operator The commonly used operators in genetic algorithm are selection, crossover and mutation There are several well-defined organism selection methods, and roulette wheel selection and tournament selection are popular ones. Here we use tournament selection method and select the best chromosome to replace the least one. The selection rate can be set to be between 0.1 and 0.2. Finally, the best chromosome is carried over to the 


and 0.2. Finally, the best chromosome is carried over to the next generation unaltered according to the elite selection strategy Following the selection, the crossover operation is performed upon the selected chromosomes. Let v be the size of the population and Pc \(typically between 0.6 and 1.0 be the crossover rate, and the number of chromosomes undergone crossover is v  Pc. A random starting point is selected, along with a random length, a section of each parent is then removed and swapped with the other parent In anomaly detection, the chromosome size is always large because of many quantitative attributes involved in database. Here we perform two-point or multi-point crossover between two selected individuals The next step is to mutate the newly created offspring Typical genetic algorithms have a fixed, very small mutation rate \(Pm of chromosome, therefore  the number of bits undergone crossover is . The new chromosome is randomly mutated by randomly altering bits in the parents   chromosome data structure mv p L    3.2.4.  Termination Criteria An important part of the genetic algorithm is the termination criteria i.e. when to stop reproducing the individuals. Because the fitness of the ideal individual is uncertain in anomaly detection, we can define termination criteria in two ways I individual is higher than the predefined expectation value II number of generations 4. Experiments on Anomaly Detection of Network Traffic Applying the approach described above, we have developed a fuzzy data mining and genetic optimization system \(FGS experimental network to validate the feasibility of the approach 4.1.  Database of Network Traffic In the experiment, four characteristic attributes related to network flow are selected to analyze the network traffic with system in normal and anomalous states, including Ptcp\(the proportion between number of TCP packets and the number of total packets the proportion between number of UDP packets and the number of total packets Avg.packet/sec\(the average number of packets in one second the average number of bits in one second calculate the value of the attributes for ten times in both normal and anomalous states \(intruding one host computer in the LAN by DoS attack network traffic involves twenty transactions as shown in table 1 Table 1.

Membership function F 4.2.  Parameters Optimization The database of network traffic consists of four quantitative attributes characterized by four membership 1990 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  functions respectively, and each function is controlled by six parameters. Thus the parameter-set that is to be encoded 


six parameters. Thus the parameter-set that is to be encoded into a chromosome involves 24 parameters. Considering the span of each attribute, we specify the size of chromosome section as shown in table 2 For example, each parameter in membership function characterizing the attribute Ptcp will be encoded into a five-bit string \(chromosome section  0  and  1   Table 2. Size of chromosome section Attribute Section size \(bit Ptcp 5 Pudp 3 Avg.packet/sec 5 Avg.Mbit/sec 3  The whole size of an individual is L=5  6+3  6+5  6+3  6=96 \(bit With the method described in 3.2.1, we encode the 24 parameters separately and link them into an individual. Set the size of population equal to 5, we generate 5 individuals randomly as the initial population Choose an individual in population and decode corresponding chromosome sections into real numbers which are the parameters of four membership functions Using the parameters in mining fuzzy association rules[10 from the database of network traffic \(setting the minimum support degree minsupport=0.25 and the minimum confidence degree minconfidence=0.6 association rule-set of normal state S1 and that of anomalous state S2. Calculating the similarity of S1 and S2 we subsequently get the fitness of the current individual with the fitness function \(5 In the same way, we calculate the fitness of other individuals and the result is shown in table 3 Table 3. Individuals of initial population and their fitness Individual Similarity Fitness 00001  01100 0.712 0.288 00100  10110 0.848 0.152 10000  01101 0.741 0.259 00010  01110 0.587 0.413 00101  11110 0.652 0.348  The evolution operations include I give up the one with the lowest fitness II the other four individuals with random starting points and random length of swapping section III random bit in the four individuals and perform complementary operation Repeatedly, calculate fitness of the new individuals and reproduces next generation population. Finally, the genetic algorithm terminates after 1000 generations and the fittest individual is generated The highest fitness and corresponding similarity of each generation population in the evolution process is shown in figure 4  Figure 4.  Fitness and similarity of the best individual in generations As we can see in figure 4, the curve of fitness denotes an incremental trend in the whole process, and the best individual \(fitness=0.789 minimizes the similarity \(equals to 0.211 and anomalous rule-set Repeat the experiment with the system in other different anomalous states, and the experimental results are shown in figure 5  Figure 5. Similarity curve with system in different states 


Figure 5. Similarity curve with system in different states  The experimental results denote that we can find an ideal parameter-set by genetic algorithm. Using the 1991 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  parameter-set in anomaly detection, we can differentiate normal state of the protected system from anomalous state to the largest extent. Obviously, the membership functions generated by the genetic algorithm is more efficient than those defined with experts  domain knowledge 5.  Conclusions and Future Work The goal of applying genetic algorithm in anomaly detection is to search ideal membership functions. The main advantage is that we can define membership function randomly without experts  domain knowledge. For an IDS genetic algorithm is applied only in system design. The optimized membership functions will be used directly in real-time detection, therefore the performance of IDS will not be influenced although genetic optimization is a time-consuming process Nevertheless, membership functions still need to be tuned constantly because that the normal state of protected system changes with time. We can adapt the normal profile characterized by rule-sets membership functions ultimately, and how to build an adaptive anomaly detection system by genetic algorithm or other intelligent methods will be investigated in future research References 1] Stefan Axelsson.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
