First-order Frequent Patterns in Text Mining Jan Blatak KD Group at Faculty of Informatics Masaryk University in Brno Brno Czech Republic Email xblatak@fi.muni.cz Abstract-In this paper a universal framework for mining long first-order frequent patterns in text data is presented It consists of RAP an ILP system for mining maximal first-order frequent patterns and two types of predefined background knowledge Two methods of using generated patterns for solving text mining tasks are described propositionalization and CBA class based association A new variant of the CBA rule based classifier is proposed The framework is used for solving three text mining tasks information extraction from biomedical texts 
context-sensitive text correction of English and morphological disambiguation of Czech The distributed mining of frequent patterns is described and its influence on mining in text is discussed It is shown that frequent patterns as new features for propositionalization usually provide better results than CBA Index Terms-Artificial Intelligence Neural Networks Genetic Algorithms Spiking Neuron Models JASTAP I INTRODUCTION There are many tasks in text mining and natural language processing NLP which can be efficiently solved using machine learning For example the instance based learner Timbl was used for morphological disambiguation while other classifiers like the Naive Bayes or SVM are frequently used for information retrieval 
and extraction Attribute-value propositional systems are the ones most typically used Nevertheless it is difficult to express text data in the form of feature-vectors The transformation tools often produce a very high dimensional sparse data Many of these problems can be solved using relational data mining RDM 1 Inductive logic programming ILP is concerned with RDM It integrates machine learning and logic programming The ILP system generates a logic program from the set of positive and negative examples and from a given a priori background knowledge in first-order logic It has been shown that ILP systems can be successfully used in many NLP 
tasks 2 e.g for the morphological disambiguation of Czech 3 and Slovene 4 3 Although almost all systems share some properties they are usually tuned for solving only one task It is known that many data mining tasks can be regarded as a mining of frequent patterns A frequent pattern 5 is a conjunction of literals which covers at least or records from a database The value a is referred to as a minimal frequency threshold as given by the user WARMR the first system for finding frequent patterns in first-order logic was presented in 6 In our earlier work 7 we developed RAP a system 
for mining maximal first-order frequent patterns in multirelational data We have shown that these patterns can be successfully deployed as new features in classification tasks In this paper we introduce a universal framework which utilizes long first-order frequent patterns for text mining We describe a general background knowledge for the RAP system and manner in which can be extended for solving particular text mining tasks We propose new method of applying found frequent patterns for constructing a classifier and compare it with propositionalization 8 This new method is based on a CBA class based association rule based classifier presented by Liu et al 
in 9 Propositionalization is a method which transforms a relational problem into its attribute-value propositional representation We compare propositionalization and CBA classifier on information extraction context-sensitive text correction and partial morphological disambiguation of Czech Mining in relational data is very expensive and it may be impossible to process large amounts of data Distributed computing offers a viable solution From our point of view a distributed system is a parallel system whose nodes computational units computers do not share any resources memory peripheries system clock etc Joshi et al in 10 provide an overview of the distributed mining of frequent 
attributevalue patterns For multirelational bioinformatics data the PolyFARM system 11 was developed In our experiments we utilize dRAP 12 a new version of the RAP system for independent distributed mining We show that distributed mining of frequent patterns improves accuracy of the classifiers The structure of the paper is as follows In the next section we define terms used in this paper Then RAP dRAP and the general background knowledge are described Section III In Section IV feature construction and the CBA classifier is proposed The global settings of experiments are stated in Section V The experiments are in sections 
VI VII and VIII The results are discussed in Section IX and the last section brings conclusions II FREQUENT PATTERNS Frequent patterns were introduced by Aggarwal and Imielinsky 5 as subsets of items in a transactional database A much more general definition was given by H Mannila and H Toivonenem 13 Frequent patterns are defined as conjunctions of literals In this paper we will follow this definition Firstly we need to specify what a coverage is Let us have background knowledge 13 database r and formula o The formula o covers example e C r if and only 0-7803-9365-1/05/$17.00c2005 IEEE 344 


if B U fo e The support of the pattern o is defined as supp\(r,y5 e e e C rABU A e}U it is the number of the covered examples Now we can define a frequent patterns and a frequent pattern mining task For a database r language L of all possible formulas and a minimal frequency threshold or we say that conjunction of literals o C L is a frequent pattern if and only if supp\(r 0  v The computation task is to find theory Th\(L2 r supp    Liti,ni a two-place predicate symbol The difference between B1 and B2 lies in a manner of exploring the context of the analysed word BU uses a literal hasWord/3 whose first argument determines the relative position of a word with respect to the focus word e.g 3 means the third word to the left The background knowledge BU does not use information about a position of a word in the sentence and only introduces an arbitrary word from a context IV FREQUENT PATTERNS FOR CLASSIFICATION There are two possible ways to use frequent patterns for classification propositionalization 7 15 and rule based classification 9 A Propositionalization It has been shown that frequent patterns especially frequent Datalog queries can be successfully used as new boolean features 15 Learning discriminant functions can be realized by reformulating the relational problem into an attribute-value form and then applying an efficient propositional learner This process is usually called propositionalization 8 In the attribute-value representation examples are usually represented as feature-vectors of a fixed size in the form fi  vi A f2  V2 A  A fa o Va where fi are the features and vi the values A new feature is defined 8 as a conjunction of possibly negated literals 1 where i ni C N X refers to an individual a line in a relational table or example and Vk C N literal Liti,k is defined in background knowledge B Obviously the right side of the equation 1 the body of the clause can be replaced with a frequent pattern o Features may be constructed to describe a subset of the training examples that are in some way interesting Techniques for finding interesting subgroups that are disjunctive 16 are used here Or features may be constructed to have the same value for a sufficiently large proportion of not necessarily disjunctive examples Methods for finding frequent patterns itemsets datalog queries can be employed In our work we follow the latter B Classification Based on Associations Another method is to use frequent patterns as a set of classification rules This approach has been introduced by Liu et al 9 They designed a CBA classifier Classification Based on Associations which uses so called class association rules CAR In this work we define CAR as follows Let us have a database r frequent pattern o a set of possible classes C and a total one-place function Xc r  C which assigns a class from C to the example e C r Further we define function p such that p\(c supp\(rc o supp\(r W0 345 fi X  Lt'ti 1  f Co L or  supp\(r o We define a partial order q on patterns from L We say that 9oi q 02 is true if the pattern oi is more general than the pattern 02 or 02 0-subsumes oi for 1 2 C L The frequent pattern whose extensions are not frequent is called a maximalfrequent pattern Obviously each frequent pattern is a generalization sub-pattern of some maximal one We also say that a frequent pattern is subsumed by a maximal pattern III RAP DRAP AND THE BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE A RAP In our earlier work we developed the RAP system 7 RAP is a system for searching long first-order frequent patterns in dense data Three different search strategies have been implemented in RAP Pre-defined as well as user-defined heuristics can be employed and many operators for pruning the search space are available B dRAP Although RAP exploits several improvements to increase the performance it may be impossible to process large amounts of data in a reasonable time The main problem is usually caused by using large volumes of data and too complex background knowledge It seems that parallel and distributed computing can help to partially solve this problem By separating the data into several parts which are processed on independent computers the time taken by the mining system can be reduced We implemented the dRAP-INDEPENDENT 12 algorithm which is able to mine patterns in horizontally fragmented data It is based on the Savasere distributed algorithm 14 Each node first finds all the frequent patterns in its fragment of the database Then each node sends these patterns to other nodes At the end nodes compute the global frequency of the patterns C Background knowledge We designed two different sets of general background knowledge predicates B1 and B2 They consist of predicates which specify general properties of a given focus word focuWordl21 for example that a given position in the sentence is a punctuation isPunct/2 a quotation mark isQuot/2 or that the first letter is capital begCap/2 etc 1The meaning of the term focusWord/2 is focusWord is

means that the learner marked all interactions we can see the precision of patterns may decrease in the case of US On the other hand the large increase of the support repays this lost and additional

learning examples IX DISCUSSION The results above display some interesting aspects of applying long first-order frequent patterns in text mining The most important observation is that large number of frequent patterns used as features for the propositionalization or for constructing of a CBA classifier lead to better results The only exception was in the case of context-sensitive text correction and classification with Naive Bayes classifier Maximal patterns and patterns that they subsume are better for solving the problem with propositionalization It is also possible to use infrequent patterns candidate patterns generated by the RAP system On the other hand only maximal patterns seems to be better for constructing the CBA classifier see Table IV When all frequent patterns are utilized it is more difficult to determine values of the thresholds MinCov and MinNum In our experiments the propositionalization approach outperforms CBA The main problem of the CBA classifier is that its performance strongly depends on the number of the class associations rules and values of thresholds given by user It seems that long frequent patterns we generated are not sufficient for solving the problems we mentioned Neither CBA nor propositionalization provide better results than methods mentioned in the stat-of-the-art For example Carlson et al 23 presented algorithm for solving the problem of context-sensitive text correction which performs at 98 00 level of accuracy9 Obviously the results of our approach may be improved by enlarging the background knowledge such that they would utilize all the information in data Lastly frequent patterns as new features predicates for another relational algorithm e.g Aleph can improve its performance 22 X CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented two methods of using firstorder frequent patterns in text mining the propositionalization and the classification based on association CBA These methods were compared on three different tasks information extraction from biomedical texts context-sensitive text correction and morphological disambiguation of Czech We showed that distributed computing can improve performance of both methods because of mining in a larger sample of data and a larger number of features In our experiments the propositionalization outperformed CBA We plan to design and evaluate new criteria for generating CAR and CBA We will design and evaluate automatic method for setting parameters such as minimal frequency threshold MinCov and MinNum ACKNOWLEDGMENT I am grateful to L Popelinsky for his

ear The speedup is 1.65 for the 2-node system indicating some degree of parallelization overhead mainly due to the interprocess communication to exchange the support count information The speedup is 3.76 for the 4-node system but the increasing rate of the speedup is 2.27 as the number of nodes is doubled from 2 to 4 As the number of nodes is doubled from 4 to 8 the increasing rate of the speedup is higher than linear again which indicates that PMIHP is quite scalable Number of Processors Time \(seconds 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 1 2 4 8 Figure 6 Total execution time of PMIHP to nd frequent 3-itemsets in 1,427 documents minsup  0.15 Number of Processors Speedup    0 2 4 6 8 2 4 8 Figure 7 Speedup of PMIHP minsup  0.15 The PMIHP algorithm has two main data mining activities counting the support of local candidate itemsets in the corresponding local database and counting the support of global candidate itemsets in multiple local databases These two activities are interleaved during the mining as the global support counting is invoked when the number of identiﬁed global candidate itemsets exceeds a certain number at each processing node which was set to 20,000 in our experiments To measure this global support counting time we reconﬁgured PMIHP to defer the global support counting of the global candidate itemsets at each node and synchronized the nodes before the start of the global support counting phase Figure 8 shows the global support counting time of the mining process with the logest run time among all the mining processes executed on different processing nodes Moreover we used the wall clock time to measure this global counting time hence it is an upper bound of the actual global support counting time of all the mining processes Comparing Figures 6 and 8 we can see that the 2-node case has a much longer global support counting phase than 4-node and 8-node cases The portion of the global support counting phase for the 2-node case is about 8 of the total execution time but it is about 4 for the 4-node case and about 3 for the 8-node case Thus the impact of the global support counting time on the overall speedup is very small and it is reduced further as the number of processing nodes increases Number of Processors Time \(seconds 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 2 4 8 Figure 8 Global support counting time to nd frequent 3-itemsets Since our processing environment does not provide the statistics for job accounting exact CPU time measurement was not feasible So we measured the average execution of a processing node using the wall clock time Figure 9 shows the average execution time of a node in the 1-node 2-node 4-node and 8-node conﬁgurations We can see that the 2-node case requires signiﬁcantly less average execution time per node than the 1-node case and as the number of processing nodes increases further the average execution time per node deceases more than linearly This result is completely consistent with the observed speedup values and also indicates that increased efﬁciency is behind the performance gain Since the identical PMIHP algorithm was executed on all of our system conﬁgurations the differences in execution time must be associated with some workload differences Figure 10 shows the average number of candidate 0-7695-2132-0/04/$17.00 \(C Proceedings of the 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium \(IPDPSê04

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
