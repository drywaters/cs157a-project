ON A HYBRID RULE BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM FENG ZHANG, HUI-YOU CHANG School of Information Science & Technology, Sun Yat-sen University,Guangzhou,510275,China E-mail : mrzf@163.com, changhuiyou@vip.163.com Abstract Compared with relative recently-reported conterparts, a novel recommender system prototype is implemented. Its efforts focus on the three essential issues as a whole that recommender systems have to handle: data source, data modeling and recommendation strategy. It is based on a common data format and introduces a hybrid-rule model with a strategy of one-round table scanning. Laboratory experiment results show that this recommender system produces a better outcome Key words Association-rule Mining; Sequential-rule Mining E-commerce; Recommender System; Algorithm 1. Introduction In nowaday E-commerce websites, information on goods and customers are tremendous, and information exchange manners between sellers and buyers differ greatly, thus we are witnessing intelligence-based  Ecommerce recommender systems are more and more widely used. They play the roles as traditional salespersons do According to the filtering objects, recommender systems can be classified into three categories: the content filtering based; the collaborative filtering based the hybrid content filtering and collaborative filtering based 1][2  2. Relative work Recommender systems, essentially have to handle three key issues: data source; data modeling and recommendation strategy Roughly speaking, there are two kinds of data sources: customers' ratings or evaluations; customers purchase histories. Recommender systems using the former, like LIBRA 3 Item-Based Top-N Recommendation 4 and RecTree 5 e weakness\204can not be portably used. Collecting enough ratings needs non-trivial cooperation from customers. Even this mission could be accomplished the ratings accumulated might still fail to reveal customers' real desire 6  Our research focuses on rule-based recommender systems, who utilize real transactions as data sources Real transaction is more general a format to make recommender systems be more generally-used Association rule mining is a traditional technique of collaborative filtering recommender system 7  Recommender systems based on rules are structurally succinct and their recommendations are favorable. Furthermore, the recommendations synchronously reflect the changes of customers purchase behavior. SurfLen 8 and ASARM 9 are two recently reported recommender systems of this kind SurLen 8 is a recommender system using Apriori 10 algorithm to build up its core engine. It is running under web page visiting environment rather than Ebsites. But its core technologies are similar to ours. Two recommendation methods are available in it: one is recommending through the comparison between the target user's current purchase and its history purchase; the other is recommending se. ASARM introduces an adaptive association rule recommendation algorithm as its core engine, which can produce recommendations through analysis of similar customers or similar items. The common point of the two systems is that they both employ Apriori as core engine; but the common weakness of the two is that both of them fail to avoid online rule mining, which is very time-consuming. And furthermore, ASARM is built on ratings If only association rules are employed to produce recommendations, usually enough recommendations cannot be produced. But combining association rules with sequence rules can more or less alleviate this situation. And at the same time, recommendation quality is improved Proceedings of the 2005 The Fifth International Confer ence on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT\22205 0-7695-2432-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


3. General architecture 3.1 Data sources Transaction format that is most generally used in Ecommerce websites is as following UserID::TransID::CommoditiesLists\203\203 UserID is code which uniquely represents the user TransID is transaction code which uniquely represents the transaction corresponding to the user CommoditiesLists is a vector including all the purchased goods in one transaction. It's believed that behavior modeling based on this kind of data format is the most generally way to examine customers purchase behavior. But we don't think it is a perfect way to solely mine users' browse histories, similar to purchase histories in our system, without taking different time. It also oversimplifies customers' browse behavior since the significance of items in one transaction is different from the significance of items between two different transactions. Situation is similar in Ecommerce websites which provide retail services 3.2 System model Fig. 1 illustrates the general design and recommendation process of  ASRS, standing for Association and Sequential rule Recommender System Customer  original purchase database stores all original transactions. Through data preprocess noise data are cleaned and then a formatted transaction data of customers are produced. Through association rule mining, FP-Growth 11 and sequential rule mining PrefixSpan 9 a general rule database is obtained. It is the core database to finally produce recommendations ASRS retrieves top-N recommendations based on our recommendation strategy Recommendation strategies are critical to recommender systems since they influence so much on their response time and quality.

Experimental results ASRS is implemented under laboratory environments of P4 2000MHZ, 512RAM, Windows 2000 Professional and Microsoft Access 2000 We use the synthetical datasets which are widely used in researches of association rule mining and sequence rule mining. Data format is the same as that we referred to in section 2.1. For detailed descriptions on the datasets, refer to papers d 13 pleas e Restricted by space, here we only report the results getting from C10T8S8I8 12 This dataset consist of 1,000 goods, 80,000 transactions by 10,000 customers The average number of items per transaction is 8 average length per transaction is also 8 We randomly separate the data into training/evaluation subsets with proportion of 80%/20%. Our experiment contrasts performance of en using association rule solely and using hybrid-rule\(association and sequential rule The performance criteria are recall and precision 000z Recall is the proportion of correctly recommendations that user actually like 000z Precision is the proportion in all the recommendations that the user like We assign Weight 1 and Weight 2 in the formula of session 3.2 to 0.8 and 0.7 respectively. And we recommend commodities whose lowest scores are over 20. Randomly choosing purchase of 100 customers to retrieve recommendations, we get the average recall and precision. Results in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show that hybrid-rule system performs better than its association rule counterpart in both recall and precision criteria Besides, we notice that, general speaking, precision should have declined with the recommendation number increasing. But Fig.3 shows that precision increases at the interval of 10-20. It seems that ASRS's precision reaches highest when the recommendation number is 20 Fig.4 goes a step further to show the recommendation quality of ASRS Under our recommendation strategy, in theory response time of recommendation should have increased slightly with the recommendation number going up. But with the tolerant error, we get the results showed in Fig.5, which indicating the response time is around 1.0s but doesn't absolutely increase with the number up Brief experiment results based on a real retail dataset from some supermarket are show in Fig.6 and Fig.7, which are similar with results of synthetical datasets 5. Conclusion Above we have studied basic concepts development and related technologies of E-commerce Comparing several rating-based recommender systems and two recently reported association rule based recommender systems, we address their weaknesses and implement our system design model ASRS under laboratory environment. In general, ASRS focuses on generality, effectivity and efficiency. However we must point out that, essentially, evaluation of a recommender system is a non-trivial mission    It depends on the data accumulated increasingly with the E-commerce website being used constantly   test Ntoptest recall 212\003  N Ntoptest precision  212\003  Proceedings of the 2005 The Fifth International Confer ence on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT\22205 0-7695-2432-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

Conclusions In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm based the memory indexing technique for finding the complete set of frequent patterns, especially in the case of processing sparse datasets. With the experiment results we show that our algorithm can process sparse datasets efficiently that contain long but few patterns For very large datasets, we adopt a partitioning-based strategy to decompose the mi ning task into a set of smaller tasks for mining frequent patterns References  Agrawal, R., and Srikant, R., Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules, Proc. 20 th Int\222l Conf. on Very Large Data Bases \(VLDB\22294   Agrawal R Im ielinski, T., and Swam i, A., Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc. 1993 ACM-SIGMOD Int\222l Conf. on Management of Data \(SIGMOD\22293\ngton, DC, 1993, pp.207-216   R Agrawal, H.

can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been placed appropriately by analyzing significant navigational patterns \(association rules In our experiments the percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by rules was calculated by dividing the number of common items in hyperlink sets and whole ranking lists for a given page, by the number of hyperlinks on the page separately for direct, indirect and complex rules \(Fig. 8 Note that the number of hyperlinks was put in the denominator as opposed to calculations in section 7.4 where it was ranking length 48 89%87 0 20 40 60 80 100 direct indirect complex Figure 8. The average percentage of all hyperlinks confirmed by rules Proceedings of the 2005 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and  Applications \(ISDA  05 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE The average percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by direct rules amounted to only 48%, probably because there were too few of them. Indirect and complex rules, on the other hand, confirmed many more hyperlinks  87% and 89%, respectively, due to their larger quantity. These relatively great values that we received may have resulted from the enormous differences between the average number of hyperlinks on a page  10 and the average ranking length: 51, 177, 180 for direct, indirect and complex rules respectively. Concluding, indirect and complex rules appear to be better at assessing the usefulness of hyperlinks compared to direct rules Note that in any case at least 11% of hyperlinks were not confirmed by any rule, so they may be recommended to be removed from the content of pages 8. Conclusions and future work Complex rules combining both direct and indirect rules usually increase the length of rankings compared to those based on direct associations. This helps overcome the problem of a multitude of pages with too short rankings Fig. 5 quested ranking length \(Fig. 6 rules substantially change the order of ranking lists \(Fig. 2 and 3 greater extent only confirm hyperlinks existing on web pages compared to lists extracted from complex rules, for short and long ranking lengths \(Fig. 7 of rules, especially indirect and complex ones, can be useful for the assessment of hyperlinks Concluding, far more diverse indirect rules can significantly improve potential value of recommendation. Nevertheless, to confirm the usefulness of indirect rules for end users, some tedious tests with their participation are required Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to thank Marcin Pilarczyk for providing cleansed data about hyperlinks on WUT pages 9.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
