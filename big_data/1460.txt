Since such enterprise architecture \nis the backbone of corporates operating model and business \nprocesses, enterprise architecture conversions are very strategic \nprojects. The general tendency for enterprise architecture \nconversion is big bang approach that is hard to be supported by \nexecutives as the results are very late for new architecture to \nprove. Because of complexity and trade-off between costs and \nrisk, this paper suggests simple solution that starts the project nwith small core team. First task will be developing coexistence \nmethodology between two systems in data level. By this solution \nthe whole system is able to redesign smaller business projects step \nby step. It continues developing a prototype on simple business \nscenario that contains most common behavior of all enterprise \narchitecture. The prototype's aim is to prove new design. The key \nsuccess factor of this model is agility while managing divided \nprojects and good management skill of the core team while \ndeveloping new core business processes and system architecture. \nKeywords-agile; enterprise architecture; corebanking \nconversion project management; \nLINTRODUCTION \nResponding to economic, structural as well as the radical \nchanges of business environment and technological shifts, \ncompanies needs to change their business processes, computer nsoftware applications and IT infrastructures periodically. If \ncorporates need big transformation on particular core items \nsuch as people, process, corporate culture or technology, they \nneed a methodology to accomplish this conversion. \nThe general tendency for enterprise architecture conversion \n\(EAC big-bang approach" which is a commonly \nused technique for corporates to meet this demand. The \ncorporates start huge project for these conversions. This kind of \nprojects need very crowded and complex project team and they \nconsist of analyzing all systems and business processes, \nredesigning them, matching with new technologies, and lastly \ndeveloping new infrastructure with business requirements. At \nthe end of the conversion, corporates have to shut down old \nsystem and start up new one at the same time. It also includes nhigh scale of project implementation and adoption risks. That is \nwhy, big bang approach contains high rate of failure risk. As it \nis a very comprehensive transition, there might be system \nISBN 978-1-4673-5613-8©2013 IEEE \nfailure that affects business processes, service quality and sales. \nAll these anticipated problems make executives reluctant to \nsupport these projects since the results are very late for new \narchitecture to prove. \nDue to the problems and difficulties mentioned above, this \nstudy suggests "an agile approach" as a solution. Executives, \nboard and other departments as customers will have high level \nof satisfaction because of the customer oriented nature of agile \napproach rather than system approach. Another benefit of agile \napproach is that implementation of new system architecture is \nquite easier, compared to other approaches. What is more, as \nagile approach starts with proof of concept projects and \nprogresses with small divided projects thanks to the \ncoexistence methodology, it includes zero rate of failure risk \ncompared to other rival approaches. The balance between \ntechnology and business is the contribution of this approach to \nthe system. \nThe rest of paper organize as follows, section 2 gives detail \ninformation about the Enterprise Architecture Conversion \nProjects. Section 3 details our contribution and solution for \nexecuting huge Enterprise Architecture conversion projects. \nSection 4 shows experimental results of our approach nimplementation in a bank which has 300 branches in Turkey. \nII.ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE CONVERSION \nPROJECTS nA. The Concept Of Enterprise Architecture \nThe IEEE Standard for Architectural Description of nSoftware-Intensive Systems \(IEEE P1471/DS.3 system, \nembodied in its components, their relationships to each other \nand the environment, and the principles governing its design \nand evolution". \nPeter [1] defines enterprise architecture \(EA norganizing logic for business processes and IT infrastructure \nreflecting the integration and standardization requirements of \nthe company's operating model. According to him, the \noperating model is a design which aims at having an ideal state \nof business process integration and business process \nstandardization to deliver goods and services to the customers. \nMIT, on the other hand, considers enterprise architecture as a \n380 ncritical tool for unifying IT and business strategy and as a \ndriving business value from IT. \nIn this paper the operational definition of enterprise \narchitecture is a concept which establishes the corporates nintegrated business processes and infonnation technologies to \nachieve a corporates' mission through optimal performance of \nits core business processes within an efficient infonnation \ntechnology \(IT EA Conversion Projects \nCompanies face the challenge of business processes and IT \ninfrastructures change due to the driving forces of \nglobalization, technology explosion, and rapid growth on \norganizational structure 


As a result, they increasingly need to \nconsider and pursue fundamental change - transformation - to \nmaintain or gain competitive advantage [2]. Implementing and \nmanaging fundamental change for companies is particularly nchallenging due to a number of institutional factors, huge and \ncomplex business processes, bureaucratic procedures, \nhierarchical structures and established organizational culture \n[2]. Consequently, companies have to start enterprise \narchitecture conversion \(EAC Conversion Methodologies \nThere are four main conversion methodologies that the \ncompanies resort to realize fundamental system changes [3] \n[4]. They are named as direct cut-over conversion \(known as \nthe big bang conversion mainly differ from each other in the way that \nthey realize the implementation. In the following sections, big nbang conversion and parallel conversion are compared. The \nfirst one is the most widely used method by companies while \nconverting EA and the second one constitutes the rationale \nbehind suggested approach: agile approach. \n1 depends on big bang conversion method. It is \na commonly used technique for corporates to satisfy EAC ndemands. According to Eason [5] big bang is the adoption type \nof the instant changeover as the entire organization stops using \nthe old system and starts using the fully functioning new \nsystem at the same time That is why, this method is also called \n"direct cut-over" conversion. Everybody starts to use the new \nsystem at the same date and the old system will not be used \nanymore from that moment on. \nThe conversion needs very crowded and complex project \nteam and it consists of analyzing all system and business \nprocesses, redesigning them, matching with new technologies, \nand developing new infrastructure with business requirements \n[6]. \nThe tendency for corporates to use big bang conversion as \nEAC stems from two main reasons. First reason is that one \ndoesn't have to struggle with the difficulties and ill-structured \nof legacy system. To implement best design to new enterprise \narchitecture independently without taking the old system into \nISBN 978-1-4673-5613-8©2013 IEEE \nconsideration. Second reason is that there is no risk to the \nlegacy system during EAC. The fact that training of the staff is \nonly needed for the new method not also for the changeover nperiod and the clearness of the changeover date for everyone \nfavors big bang conversion for corporates nNevertheless, big bang conversion is treated as the riskiest \nmethod in the literature [4] [6]. First of all fall back'-plans are \nhard to develop and become more impossible when the big \nbang has taken place. There can also a need for catch up period \n\(initial dip phenomenon ndifficulties. Furthennore, it is also hard to be supported by \nexecutives as the results are very late for new architecture to \nprove. It includes high scale of project implementation and \nadaptation risks. It is hard to become familiar with new system \nfor the end users soon. As it is a very comprehensive transition, \nthere might be system failure that affects business processes, \nservice quality and sales. \n2 nTo minimize conversion risks met during the transitions, \nparallel conversion is an alternative method for transferring \nbetween previous systems to target system in an organization. \nWith coexistence methodology in data level, two systems can \nbe run simultaneously for some period of time. When the \nrequirements for the new system are met, the old system is \nshut down [4]. Although the process requires careful planning \nand control as well as a significant investment in labor hours, \nit is favored as it minimizes risk compared to the other nconversion methodologies. Lee [6] also states his preference \nfor parallel conversion as follows: "When the organization \ndemands heavily on the old \(legacy costs for a less risky parallel \napproach, should be in favor of those extra costs". \nIILAN AGILE APPROACH FOR ENTERPRISE \nARCHITECTURE CONVERSIONS \nThis study suggests simple, agile, business oriented and \nrisk-free solution for enterprise architecture conversions \nprojects. CIO.com cites a Dynamic Markets survey of 800 IT nmanagers, reporting that 62 percent of IT projects fail to meet \ntheir schedules and 25 percent of IT projects get canceled \nbefore completion [7]. \nThe success of conversion project relies on the right \nbalance of business and technology. According to Juan Porter \n[8] successful change management requires equal attention to \nthese four components: process, technology, people and \ncorporate culture. \nAgile approach depends on parallel conversion method and \nit not only focus on technology and techniques but also people nSo, the approach should be business oriented technology while \ndeveloping our new system. Agile approach works iteratively \nand incrementally and targets at the whole picture while \nexecuting conversion projects. It is a customer-oriented \napproach as it makes EA attractive for them. It includes high \nlevel of human interaction instead of virtual communication \nduring the project to generate significant performance. Every nbusiness process and system artifact design in agile approach \nmust also be as simple as possible. Porter [8 states that \n381 \nconversion manager should ensure that all stakeholders - from \nthe top executives to end users - are equipped to maximize \ncompanies' new solution. The motto of the approach is: stated \nin Ambler [9 


as "Think at enterprise level but act locally". \nWe can deduce from the above discussion, in agile \napproach EAC should start with small core team. First task \nwill be developing coexistence methodology between two nsystems to gain parallel adoption. By this way two systems is \nable to live in coexistence and the whole system is able to \nredesign smaller business projects step by step. With \ndeveloping coexistence system in the data level system can run \nparallel and projects can be agile now. Federated authorized \ndepartment should be created for managing all conversion \nprojects. This department should include two types of team. \nOne of them is core team which has determined numbers of \nexperts and another one is conversion team which can be nincreased or decreased according to scale of the ongoing \nprojects. Finished steps affects the other small projects in good \nway. \nDefine Current EA \nDefine Target EA \nCreate Conversion Roadmap \(Proj ect Plan EA Project Estimation \nStart EA Con versi on Proj ect \nCreate Federated EA Department \nForm Core EA Team nDefine EA Prototype of Core Module \nhnplement and Prove EA through Prototype \nProduce and Run Core Module nRun Core Module with old System Simultaneously \nby Coexistence Methodology \nDivide EA Project into Small Managable \nAgile Proj ects \nForm Conversion Team For Each Proj ect \nhnplement Each Small Project \nAdopt Smal.l Projects with Paral.lel Conversion \nFinish EA Conversion Project \nFig. 1. Chronological order for EAC projects nISBN: 978-1-4673-5613-8©2013 IEEE \nThe schema above can be defined as the project \nmanagement steps in a chronological order for accomplishing \nEAC projects which are huge, complicated and risky within the \nagile point of view. The flow like nature of the schema reveals \nthe ease of agile approach in any conversion projects. As can \nbe seen, the agile approach starts with proof of concept projects \nand progress with small divided projects thanks to the \ncoexistence methodology. Compared to other rival approaches, \nthere is a great emphasis on customer satisfaction due to its \ncustomer oriented nature which can be easily seen in the nrelevant steps. Overall, this system is also preferable due to its \ncontribution to the balance between technology and business \nand the choice of paper title "An Agile Approach for \nConverting Enterprise Architectures" is based on this logic. \nA. Roadmap for EAC \nRoadmap is a plan of master project to summarize the \ncompany's current situation and it contains chosen technology, \nproject management approach, and new architecture design and \nimplementation steps. [t also contains new business and new \ntechnology architecture It is executed as small IT projects to \nimplement the whole scope. \nA manager should choose one of the most common EAF as \na tool to simplity conversion project. EAC needs current \nbusiness and technology diagram and goal diagram to define \nroadmap. Managers should draw current EAF and target EAF \nbefore beginning conversion projects. EAF also provides \norganizations with the ability to understand and analyze \nweaknesses or inconsistencies to be identified and addressed. \nAs a result, EAF help company to see big picture while ndefining roadmap for EAC. \nWhile developing the roadmap, the manager should bring \nthe core business and technology implementation forward and \nprioritize it in first and most important small project. It is a \nproof of concept project. This paper offers the following \nroadmap for EAC; \n• Defining Current Architecture \n Determining EAC Goals \n• Choosing Technology \n• Implementing Coexistence Model \n• Using Agile Approach \n• New Architecture Design \no Business Processes Design \no System Architecture Design \no Prototyping and Proving \no User Interface Design \nB. EACGoals \nEAC goals may differ according to company's current EA \nsituation. As a result, a company's current technology and \nbusiness infrastructure should be well defmed. As enterprise nlevel companies mostly have complex and high uncertain \nenvironment. That means, the rules and behaviors of the \norganization determines the target EA which in turn determines \nEAC goals. Because of the company's vision for 5 years, target \nprojection must be considered while determining EAC goals. \n382 \nManager should mind the numbers of target customers, target \nservice/production process and target service point. One more npoint that needs to be considered for determining EAC's goal is \nthe company's target service type that may be 7/24 or in \nbusiness hours. Target service type affects new architecture \nintensely. \nAfter stating the company's based goals, the common best \npractice specifications of EA should be added to the goals. \nSuggested specifications are as follows: \n• Well defmed and standardized business processes as \nnegotiated \n• Central system structure includes software and \nhardware \n• High-performance communication technology \nbetween application layers \n• Powerful information engine which can use either \nsystem alerts and business alerts \n Smooth and fast application deployment \n• Data integrity from database to user interface level \n• Enough level security not anymore. \n• Open to new technology adaptation \n• Ability to other application integration easily n• International standardization \n• High availability and sustainability \n• Usability and high satisfaction on User Interfaces \n• Customer oriented approach on every EA process \n• Agile software development life cycle SDLC nmanagement approach to accomplish project successfully. \nThere are two known approaches while managing projects; one \nof them is traditional approach the other one is agile project \nmanagement approach 


Traditional approach is published by \nProject Management Institute \(PMI Project Management Body of Knowledge   nWhile planning all EAC project as a program, traditional \nproject management, which is defined by PMI, is used. \nHowever, in divided projects of EAC which are small building \nblocks of the whole program management agile project \nmanagement is used. According to Daniel and John Fernandez \n[12] this type of management is called as "Hybrid Approach". \nAlthough our suggested solution use two project management \napproach and it seems as hybrid, agile project management is \ndominating all conversion projects because of the divided nnature of the projects. \nAfter determining project approach, establishing roadmap \nand generating project plan, companies need to make \nprojection estimation in order to determine resource, time and \nbudget for EAC nISBN: 978-1-4673-5613-8©2013 IEEE \n2 2008 of project \nestimating techniques which are: analogous estimating \(Top­\ndown parametric estimating, three \npoints estimating and what-if analysis. \nIn this approach, a manager should mix top-down, bottom­\nup estimation techniques to obtain the best estimation. Not only \ntop-down but also bottom-up estimation should be considered \nabout time and budget in projection. Top-down estimation \nshould be done first. Validity of top-down duration estimates \ndepends on historical information, similarity of the historical \nprojects and expert judgment. After that, to do bottom-up \nestimation, every single project should be inspected in detail. \nAll tasks identified in work break down structure and \nestimation should be done Duration time should be calculated \nin person-day unit to understand clear and simple employee \nallocation After determining person-day of all projects, budget \ncan be calculated. This result should be compared with top­\ndown estimation. Top-down and bottom-up estimation should \nbe approximate to gain good estimation. While estimating each \ntask, analogous estimating method should be used by using \nexpert judgment. After this step project plan may be updated. \nA manager of EAC project has to prove this project \nestimation to the board for project approval. Cross check time \nand budget projection with trusted advisory company is a \ncogent evidence for approving EAC projection. \nD more significant \nthan business and technology development. In this section, how \nto achieve this management issue successfully is discussed. \n1 organization, all \ndepartment tend to be in project implementation. All \ndepartments at issue want to be in decision process. In tum, \nthere are too many heads and competing departments which \nmake the process slow down. It cause to chaos and lead in \nlosing control. In order to execute, conversion Project \nCompany needs to create fully authorized federated \ndepartment. Due to the enterprise architecture notion, the name \nof the department should be Enterprise Architecture \nDepartment \(EAD Information Technology. \n2 different roles of people such as business domain expert, \nsoftware architect, software developer, system analyst, project \nmanager, test engineer, deployment expert. It is hard to \nconsolidate these roles in just one department. \nIt is important to position key employees for project: \nsoftware architect, software developer, system analyst and test \nengineer in the EA department to maximize efficiency and gain \nrapid output during project implementation. They should \nchange their position to the EA department if it is possible. For \nanother resources especially business domain experts, company \nshould choose strong matrix organization structure to manage \nhuman resources in EAC projects. \n383 \nE Conversion \nDespite the fact that EAC projects are business oriented, IT \ntask items are more than business task items. IT projects are \nknowledge base projects and they are highly depended on \npersonal knowledge and skills. \nEmployment of conversion project team is a very critical \nissue and this team should be recruited by technical person who \nis independent of human resource department. Another \nimportant issue is training these people. Management of this \nteam is core competence for the process of agile approach. \nTwo types of organization group are offered. One of them \nis core team which has determined numbers of experts and \nanother one is conversion team which can be increased or \ndecreased according to scale of the ongoing projects. The key \nsuccess factor of this model is agility while managing divided \nprojects and good management skill the core team while \ndeveloping new core business processes and system \narchitecture. Core team has to include Enterprise Architects, \nwho are minimum 2 business domain experts with minimum 7 \nyears' experience and high level skills on software architecture \ndesign and implementation. Enterprise architect count should \nbe determined according to EAC project size. \nDepending on their experiences on big EAC projects, the nrecruitment of project team should comprised of outsource and \nin-house employees. Because of parallel adoption method and \ncoexistence system, conversion project can run step by step. \nDuring EAC, the numbers of divided projects that are already \nrunning may be increased or decreased according to next \nbusiness process 


and technology implementation. Therefore, \nthe numbers of conversion project members may change \ndynamically and the numbers become uncertain. Hereby \ncompany should outsource some part of project to manage this nuncertainty. \nF parallel adoption while implementing EAC \nprojects. Parallel adoption leads companies to more agile \nduring conversion projects. For implementing parallel \nadoption, the company needs to develop coexistence model. It nis only way to implement coexistence model at data level for \nabstracting business processes. Coexistence model may be \nsynchronous or asynchronous. If the old and new system is the \nsame database software synchronous would be used; otherwise \nit would be asynchronous [13]. According to Ozer and \nGlindebahar [13 Coexistence system can be preferred as it \nonly adds just 2% performances overhead to the system. So it \nis possible to gain advantage with spending low system \nresource to simplify EAC. \nG project includes lots of divided IT projects. Every \nproject includes business and technology goals and a team. \nEfficiency and team management bring into front. Agile \npractices expert on this two items. Therefore manager should \nuse agile project management practices because of achieving \ntarget efficiently in small projects. John D. Fernandez and \nDaniel J. Fernandez [12] explain set of agile project \nmanagement practices including the following: simplicity, hug \nthe changes, fmish and focus on next job, incrementally \nISBN 978-1-4673-5613-8©2013 IEEE \nchange, maxImIze value of every task, govern with a goal, \nquery every single task, fast feedback from all stakeholders, \nhigh quality output, deliverable, create documentation just to ngain value. \nConsequently, because of huge amount of small projects, \nagile project management dominates the EAC project. Hence, \ncompany needs to learn and implement these agile practices \nwhile developing new enterprise architecture. \n1 level of technology and \ntechniques are necessary but not sufficient factors for making \nconversion projects a success. The key success factor, \nhowever, is focusing on people \(project team, customers, end­\nusers executive boards 14] \nstates that the success of a project depends more on the quality \nof the people on a project, and their organization and \nmanagement than the tools corporates use or the technical \napproaches they take. So, a successful conversion project \nshould direct its attention to the organization and management \nof human resources. One shouldn't forget that EA model is \nuseless unless the project team cannot take advantage of it no \nmatter how perfect it is. \nAmbler [9] follows Fred Brooks' notion and claim that \nmanager of EAC would realize that it needs to make their work \nattractive to their customers \(software developers, system \nanalyst business stakeholders, IT & senior business executives \nand end users perceive \nthat you have value to add, your enterprise architecture efforts \nwill aid them in their jobs. In turn, they are much more likely to \nwork with you. If, on the other hand, they think that you're \nwasting their time, they won't work with you. They'll find \nways to avoid you, to cancel or postpone meetings with you. \nThey want to avoid using your new system which is a big \nchallenge for the success of projects. \nWhat Brooks [14] and Ambler [9] have in common is that a \ncompany should support the new EA system until it proves nitself. It is very important to build customer representative team \nto support new EA. Customer representative team consists of \nsenior business experts who are trained by project team on new \nEA and user interfaces. The function of this team is informing \nthe system users to solve the problems that occur in parallel run \nof the system. The end-users believe that the new architecture \nis fully supported by management thanks to this representative \nteam. \n2  there are critical points in agile \napproach which make it effective and superior to its rivals. \nFirst critical point in agile is the concept of simplicity. One \nshould keep enterprise architecture artifacts as simple as \npossible since it will increase the chances that audience will \nunderstand them. The project team will actually read them and \nyou will be able to keep them up to date over time. The idea is \nthat a simple model that project teams actually use is more \nvaluable than detailed documents. So, each phase during nconversion should comprise simple steps. \n384 \nThe second significant competence of agile is its being niterative and incremental since it is easier to implement and \nmanage. In this way, every level of corporate culture can \nunderstand this simplified implementation methodology. While \nconverting to new EA, company should execute projects step \nby step to gain agility. \nLastly, prototyping and proving are pros of agile approach. \nThat is, new EA contains new technology and new business \nprocess design as well as the integration of these two critical \nitems. New design needs to prove itself to build all EA on it. \nSo, company must develop simple prototype over a small \nbusiness scenario which encloses most common and core case \nof all EA If prototype proves itself, project goes on this \nprototype but if not prototype has to be redesigned. So ncompany is saved from spending much time to build wrong \ndesign and spending more human resource. \nIn line 


with Amber [9] we can add one more building block \nfor agile approach. That is, the success of change management \nrelies on the right balance between business and technology. \nSo, the approach should be business oriented technology while \ndeveloping our new system and conversion manager ensures \nthat all stakeholders from the top executives to end users - are \nequipped to maximize companies' new solution. \nIV.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nThe proposed model has been used for a large scaled \nenterprise architecture conversion project which started in July \n2009 and is being expected to finish in 2013, in a bank which \nhas 300 branches in Turkey. In this project the whole IT \ninfrastructures and computer application modules have been \nrenewed to adapt new technologies and convert to new \nbusiness processes. With this new system, the bank has been a \ntechnology pioneer instead of being a technology follower. \nBesides, eighteen site visits have been taken place from well­\nknown banks and enterprises. These institutions have been \ninformed about the proposed model and conversion projects \nthat are mentioned in this article. \nThe bank has been transformed into 3 tier application \nserver architecture from 2 tier in this conversion. A powerful \nenterprise architecture framework EAF development. Thanks to this EAF, a \nsoftware production line is formed so that an XTM software \npackage which is comprised of 200 user interfaces & 20 sub \nmodules, a core banking application that has 2200 user ninterfaces & 120 sub modules and internet banking application \nwith 287 user interfaces & 18 sub modules were implemented. \nConversion project has cost 68000 man day and 36 million \nUSD in total. \nDuring the project, a team of Enterprise Architects with the \nnumber of twelve has been available. Yet, the number of \nproject team that has implemented the small dividend business \nprojects, has varied between five and eighty depending on the \nnumber and the size of the ongoing projects. This particular \nteam has been related to Enterprise Architecture Department \nwhich is federated and fully authorized for the conversion \nproject. Thanks to matured EAF, outsource and in-house \nemployees can easily be assigned to ongoing business projects. \nISBN 978-1-4673-5613-8©2013 IEEE \nA team has been constituted to support the modules which are \nproduced and put into use so that the conversion can be easily \naccepted and involved by end users. That is, a user oriented napproach is adopted. An in-service training has been given to \nthe end users. Required training documents and videos have \nbeen prepared and deployed on the software applications. \nAlong with the academic references given above, a \nquestionnaire has been conducted to IT Department of a bank \nwhich has 300 branches in Turkey with the aim of verifying the \nsimplicity, dynamicity and practicality of the proposed model. \nIn this questionnaire, two EACs, one of which has at least four \nyear experience with the budget of 60 million dollar has been \ncompared by thirty IT managers and eight enterprise architects. \nThe results showed that the proposed model has proved its \nacceptability by showing the fact that while 76% of the \nsubjects stated that the acceptance hasn't been given easily by \nthe senior management in traditional approach, the situation is njust the opposite in agile approach thanks to the prototype \nmodel. Another advantage of the proposed model is its being a \nrisk free system which can be easily observed in the results of \n"The risk of the project being failed is highly probable" and \n"The success of the project termination is high" questions for \neach approach. Due to the parallel run and step by step module \ndevelopment and deployment, agile approach is favored by the \nsubjects in the item: "The implementation of EAC with \nagile/traditional approach is easier Lastly, 100% of the \nsubjects have stated that they will prefer agile approach over \ntraditional approach in prospective conversions. \nTABLE I.

[n \nTurkey, for example, there are big companies which are nchallenged by these conversion processes. This stems from the \ncomplexity of the [T infrastructures, computer applications \nand internal business processes. These companies try to \nconvert their EA via traditional project approaches. That is, \nthe majority of them use big bang approach in their \nconversions which add to the complexity of the process as \nwell as maximizing the failure of adoption to the new system. \n[n this study, however, a simple, iterative and customer \noriented approach is suggested for enterprise architecture nISBN: 978-1-4673-5613-8©2013 IEEE \nconversIOn projects to eliminate or at least minimize the \ncomplexity as well as the risk factors. A questionnaire has \nconducted. The items in the questionnaire are related to these ncriteria in order to compare traditional big bang approach with \nproposed agile approach. The empirical also proved our thesis. \nThe key elements of this approach like EA roadmap, using \nenterprise architecture frameworks, hybrid project \nmanagement, agile methodology, organizational management, \nbusiness oriented approach, customer centricity, parallel \nadoption and user experienced design are investigated and \nexplained in detail in an order. \nREFERENCES \n[I] P.

Our insights can be\nused to guide future work to focus on application scenarios\nwith the most room for improvement.\nVII. RELATED WORK\nThere have been several studies of MapReduce perfor-\nmance in opportunistic environment, especially in volunteer\ncomputing systems [4], [5], [11], [12]. In order to deliver\nreliable MapReduce service in a highly dynamic environ-\nment, MOON [4], [5] proposes to augment the opportunistic\nMapReduce cluster with a small number of dedicated nodes,\nwhere an adaptive algorithm is proposed for data placement\nand speculative task scheduling under such augmentation.\nAnother thread of research tries to improve performance on\nopportunistic resources by predicting the availability of these\nresources. ADAPT [12] uses the availability history to assign\nan expected availability rate to each new participant of the\nvolunteer computing system. Similar techniques are adopted\nin [11] to select a subset of most available nodes in volunteer\ncomputing systems. All of these works focus on improving\nthe performance of a single job; in contrast, our work focuses\non the fairness among multiple jobs in a shared environment.\nAnother related topic is the scheduling of MapReduce jobs\nin a dedicated environment. In addition to the FIFO, the\nCapacity, and the Fair schedulers in Hadoop release, more\nsophisticated schedulers have been proposed to satisfy various\nperformance requirements, such as LATE [8], Delay [13], DP\n[14], and Corona [15 LATE [8] proposes a more accurate pre-\ndiction of job progress in a \(physically is used together with the analysis of overhead to im-\nprove the scheduling of speculative tasks. A refined version of\nLATE in [13] incorporates delay scheduling and copy-compute\nsplitting to improve data locality and avoid performance issues\nintroduced by LATE. Dynamic Proportional Share Scheduler\n[14] takes into consideration the economic aspect of resource\nallocation by letting users bid for their resources. To 


handle\nthe drastic growth of data in Facebook, Corona [15] introduces\na cluster manager on top of JobTrackers to improve the\nscalability of MapReduce clusters by separating the duties of\nresource management and execution management.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate MapReduce scheduling in\nan opportunistic environment with focus on the fairness\nbetween multiple jobs. We identify several deficiencies of\nthe current fair scheduler, based on which we propose a new\nscheduler that uses the notions of fractional share and map-\nreduce correlation to incorporate dynamic node availability\ninto scheduling decisions. Our implementation in Hadoop\nverifies that the proposed scheduler can improve fairness by\nsignificantly reducing the variability in job completion times,\nachieving up to 50% better fairness in our experiments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “Amazon EC2 Spot Instances,” aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/.\n[2] J.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
