  1 Mission Optimization and Tradeoffs of using SiGe Based Electronics for a Cryogenic Environment Rover Mission O. Kegege, M. Barlow, A. Mantooth, R. Ulrich University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas 72701, USA okegege@uark.edu, mbarlow@uark.edu, mantooth@uark.edu, rulrich@uark.edu  Abstract Electronics onboard rovers and spacecrafts are kept at approximately 20 373 C by using radioisotope heater units \(RHU\ mechanically pumped fluid loops \(MPFL and centralized warm boxes 12 These thermal control mechanisms add weight and volume of payload, adding to limitations on the number of science instruments that can be accommodated in a space mission. The University of Arkansas together with partnering universities and industry 
have designed various radiation-hardened silicon germanium \(SiGe\ based electronics modules and systems that can be used to build sp acecraft instruments,  robotics components, life support electronics components, and other application-specific integrated circuits \(ASICs\r space These low temperature electroni cs that can withstand space radiation and thermal cycling would reduce cost, weight and increase the number of instruments on the payload hence more science data. In this paper, we evaluate mission optimization, reliability, benefits/cost, and tradeoffs of using SiGe based electronics and systems for cryogenic planetary surface exploration.  Also, we analyze components that can be built us ing SiGe based electronics and show a quantitative impact to a manned planetary

Also, such design s dictate centralized wiring architectures. For inst ance, if a controller is located inside a warm box, there will necessarily be wiring from this central 
location to dispersed sensors and actuators \(refer to Figure 1\. This increases system power drain of payload, weight volume, launch costs, and long cables can negatively impact safety and reliability. SiGe based electronics withstand the temperature swi ngs in space eliminating the need for \223warm boxes\224 and MPFL around electronics components  NASA\222s strategic goals include manned exploration of the Moon between 2015 and 2020. The crew and cargo launch vehicles for the Constellation Program are under development.   Apart from this, we are sending rovers to explore Mars\222 surface and, at so me point in the future, there will be likely a rover mission to Europa.  For each mission the total payload is set at a given limit ultimately constrained by launcher consid erations.  There is always a 
need to reduce the unnecessary weight associated with the thermal protection and create room for more payload/scientific instruments.  This can be achieved by developing components that are radiation hardened and can reliably operate and survive in extreme space temperatures without thermal protection for the duration of missions Also, developing microcontroller based reconfigurable architectures would increase flexibility of using different types of sensors or actuators programmable without changing interfacing techniques  The temperature on the lunar surface ranges from -180 373 C to +125 373 C, and -230 373 C inside shadowed polar craters Besides this, there are radiation effects such as single event upsets \(SEU\solar events, and total ionizing dose \(TID 
For lunar surface exploration, electronics and systems must be able to withstand thermal cycling and 100 krad of radiation over 10 years.   SiGe electronics have been tested to operate down to -230 373 C \(43 K\9   Also  SiGe  de vices  have been tested to be TID tolerant to Mrads [1      Furthermore, several papers have been published demonstrating the radiation hardness and operational capabilities of SiGe devices for cryogenic space missions/lunar applications [1  1 3  1 4  1 5  17   18   and [1   I n t h i s pa pe r t h e c once p t o f o p t i m i z i ng m i ssi ons in cryogenic space environm ents by using SiGe based electronics is investigated.

  4 5  E STIMATION OF T RADEOFFS  It takes about $10,000 to laun ch 1 kg of mass to space. As discussed in section 1, thermal protection system on MSL occupies significant mass.  It is certain that we may not fully eliminate the weight associated with thermal protection but, if we eliminate the part of the 61 meters of tubes that is designated to warm electronics boxes by replacing with SiGe based electronics, how many more science instruments can we get onboard?   What fraction of costs associated with thermal protection can we invest in more science instruments?  Currently, the MSL rover is under development and there is no clear publication showing the exact weight and cost of thermal protection Assuming 100 kg of thermal protection goes around electronic devices, then will save 100 kg* $10,000/kg 1,000,000.   10 instruments of MSL rover weigh 80 kg was limited to 80 kg\we reduce more than 80 kg towards thermal control by using radiation hardened cryogenic electronics, the tradeoff will be adding 10 science instruments.  Apart from improving payload capability and reduction of launch costs, other advantages include:  less wiring due to a decentralized architecture reducing power, weight, increasing safety\ and fewer heat rejection radiators 6  E VALUATING S IGNIFICANCE TO A M ANNED S PACE M ISSION  Constellation\222s modules, subsystems and components are under development.  This equipment would likely include rovers, habitation modules, science instruments, equipment for drilling and production of resources on the lunar surface spacecraft components, space suits, etc   Figure 9 Constellation vehicles and possible future Lunar colonization \(Images courtesy of NASA  Using current technologies the systems and equipment demonstrated in Figures 9 and 10 would need thermal control to keep electronic devices within their operating temperatures.  However, if radiation hardened cryogenic systems are design, tested, and space qualified, the cost of launching a manned space mission would significantly reduce.  This is because th ermal protection will then be eliminated for every part of e quipment or system that house electronic components   Figure 10 Possible applications of SiGe based RadHard modules and systems \(Image courtesy of NASA 7  C ONCLUSIONS  We propose and recommend the elimination of thermal protection/control for sections that house electronics onboard Lunar and Mars missions.  Several radiation hardened components that can work fr om           -180 \260C to 125 \260C have been fabricated and tested.  Some components have been tested to operate down to 2 K.  The case of Mars, it is not that critical for SiGe based electronics when we consider a temperature swing of        90 \260C to +20 \260C \(night to day\.  The emphasis should be more on designing components using radiation hardened technologies that can operate in extreme space temperatures.  Also more work on testing and space qualifying these devices would foster space exploration  Also, implementing reconfigurable architectures will be very beneficial to future rover missions.  For instance, the proposed integrated system shown in Figure 8 would enable a single spare to fulfill multiple electronic tasks offering reduction in flight spare inventories for long duration missions.   Another tradeoff to consider is adding reconfigurability/capabilities like inflatable balloons thrusters, and other devices to Mars rover missions; in place of the reduced thermal protection achieved by using SiGe electronics.   Then, cons idering the seasonal winds on Mars, move the rover to another area, once done with a study area.   Instead of laun ching one mission to a specific area, then followed by another costly mission a few years later to another area \(based on the current trend\, future missions should study more than one location R EFERENCES  1  C.D.

The prototype em ploys Spacecraft Capabilities Tasking Definition, and Acquisition Feasibility schema They are not intended to be one-off versions of the GetCapabilities, DescribeTasking, and GetFeasibility schema.  They are sparse schemas that support the design of the data exchanges needed for employing AGI mission modeling capabilities The sparse schema is used for the first prototyping steps The schema will be brought in to compliance with the SPS Implementation Specification in the final steps of prototyping SpacecraftCapabilities The Spacecraft Capabilities Reque st schema, illustrated in Figure 6, consists of Country and Payload Type elements These are the elements define d in the spacecraft schema\222s Spacecraft Classification and Pa yload Operations elements If the User does not specify a country, the search will include all countries.  The Payload Type can be Optical Imager or Radar Imager.  If a Payload Type is not specified the search will include both imagers The User populates the Spacecraft Capabilities Request XML document and sends it to the PoC-SPS where it is received and parsed.  The PoC-SPS searches and retrieves Spacecraft Classification and Pa yload Operation data from the SOC, populates the Sp acecraft Capabilities Response XML document, and sends it to the User AcquisitionFeasibility The User receives and pars es the Spacecraft Capabilities Response XML document and selects the applicable spacecraft and imaging payloads.  The User populates the Acquisition Feasibility Request XML document and sends it to the PoC-SPS where it is received and parsed The Acquisition Feasibility Request schema, illustrated in Figure 6, contains Spacecraft Pa yload Pairing, Feature of Interest, and Acquisition Constraints The request also includes the radar scan mode from Radar Payload Operation element if th e imager is a Radar Imager A Feature of Interest is defined by a ground point A full set of acquisition constraints includes geometric temporal, environmental, and quality. Examples of acquisition constraints for an Op tical Imager are: geometric slant range elevation angle range, temporal - time of day interval, environmental - solar elevation angle range, and quality - ground sample resolution range The PoC-SPS does not incorporate ground sample resolution since it requires knowledge of the detector configuration.  For example, an optical detector would require, at a minimum, detector focal length and pixel width.  However, a User can select an imaging payload based on its ground sample resolution provided in the Spacecraft Capabilities Response XML document The PoC-SPS receives and processes the Acquisition Feasibility Request.  The spacecraft payload pairing is used to retrieve the payload field of regard from the SOC and the spacecraft orbital elements from CelesTrak, the authoritative source of NORAD or bital elements.  Then the AGI Components are activated to determine the Acquisition Feasibility Response The payload field of regard is used instead of the field of view because it corresponds to the in-track and cross-track range that the payload could be pointed The Acquisition Feasibility Response sequence contains a number of acquisition interval start and stop times and corresponding acquis ition geometry The PoC-SPS populates the AcquisitionFeasibilityResponse XML document and provides it to the User The User can request Acquisition Feasibility Responses from a number of potential DPs and select the DP that best satisfies the User needs 6  F IRE S AT S YS ML   AGI  C OMPONENTS I NTERFACE P ROTOTYPING  The interaction between the SPS operations and AGI Components is the basis of the interaction between a FireSat SysML model and AGI Components SysML is a domain-specific modeling language for systems engineering.

InterCAX is prototyping the SysML interface with AGI Components Figure 7 is an overview of how a FireSat SysML model could interact with AGI Components to carry out trade studies on FireSat system elements There are two types of interactions.  The first is a setup of the scenario elements cache c ontaining candidate spacecraft imaging payloads, relays, and ground stations.  These candidate elements are populated from the FireSat system elements pool.  This pool contains all of the FireSat elements and variations under consideration. The second interaction is a series of elements selections, accessibility queries, and coverage queries The accessibility and coverage data returned by AGI Components are used to assess FireSat measures of effectiveness.  Examples ar e area covered, revisit time memory margin, and power margin The accessibility and coverage data are also used to assess FireSat resource usage strategies, e.g 
200  Communication link availability for command uplink telemetry downlink, and image downlink 200  Memory used for image storage versus memory freed up by downlink during and after imaging 200  Power used for image collection and downlink versus power replenished during sunbathing and normal operations The current prototyping of the interaction between the FireSat SysML model and AGI Components is confined to the data exchange interface of Figure 8 200  Scenario Elements Initialization 200  Accessibility Chain Request and Response 200  Feature Coverage Request and Response The spacecraft orbit is modeled w ith the standard set of six orbital elements.  The imaging payload is modeled with rectangular or conic field of view half angles and a direction of pointing in the spacecraft re ference frame.  The field of view is modeled, instead of the field of regard, since it represents the extent of the coverage capability at any instance of time. The field of regard represents the potential coverage Accessibility chains are used to determine time intervals of accessibility through a string of serially linked scenario elements As an example, take a chain consisting of a feature of interest, a mission spacecraft, a relay spacecraft, and a ground station.  The chain capability determines the intervals of time that the missi on spacecraft is in view of the feature of interest and the rela y and, at the same time, the relay is in view of the ground station.  In view means that the lines of sights between th e elements satisfy viewing constraints A feature of interest, an imaging payload on a mission spacecraft, a relay spacecraft, and a ground station chain is more restrictive since line of si ght to the feature of interest must be within the imaging payload field of view. The satellite can image the feature of interest and downlink the image through the relay satellite during these intervals of time The feature of interest can be a point or an area.  An area is defined by a set of latitude, longitude, and altitude vertices connected by straight lines.  The AGI Components coverage capability fills in the area with grid points with a user defined spacing The user also selects among the following figure of merits for area coverage 200  Area covered, i.e. square kilometers 200  Percent of area covered 200  Area covered in each time interval 200  Minimum, maximum, and average response times 200  Minimum, maximum, and average revisit times 
 


   12 The response time is a measure of the time between a request for coverage of an area grid point and the time at which coverage is achieved The revisit time is a measure of the intervals during which coverage of a grid point is not provided, also known as coverage gaps 7  C URRENT S TATUS AND F UTURE P LANS  The SOC is currently populated with Earth observation navigation, communications and technology development spacecraft as well as ground facilities that support spacecraft launch and operations The SOC contains 59 Earth observation satellites from 20 countries.  There are 44 optical imaging satellites with a total of 116 operating modes, and 15 radar imaging satellites with a total of 66 operating modes.  An optical operating mode is a combination of sensor, spectrum projected field of view, and ground resolution.  Examples of radar operation modes are spotlight, stripmap, and scanSAR The schema has been defined for the User - PoC-SPS data exchange of Figure 6 and the Discover Sensors capability has been prototyped as A pplication Programming Interface API\e next step is to prototype all the capabilities as both as API and XML document interfaces Then, the XML document inte rface will be brought into compliance with the SPS Impl ementation Specification The prototyping of FireSat SysML and AGI Components interaction is taking place in geographically separated facilities: AGI in Exton, Pennsylvania and InterCAX in Atlanta, Georgia.  XML documents were exchanged by email during the initial prototyping.  Current prototyping incorporates program-to-program automatic exchange of XML documents, with all the prototyping at InterCAX Future prototyping will include an API passing of data The InterCAX approach to the design and implementation of FireSat SysML model and AGI Components interaction is addressed in reference 2 Figure 7.

   14 The schema has been defined for the FireSat SysML and AGI Components interaction of Figure 8.  The Setup System Elements and Determine Feature Coverage capabilities have been prototyped.  The next step is to prototype all the capabilities as both API and XML document interfaces 8  C ONCLUSIONS  An SPS providing a COTS GetFeasibility operation will make it easier for Users to discover sensors that fulfill their needs.  A COTS common inte rface will provide the User with one well-known set of operations for the initial discovery of candidate sensors A final selection of sensors can be carried out using the SPS operations of the individual DPs Additionally, an SPS server c ontaining a catalog of sensors can be created to provide the Users with one-stop-shopping for the initial discovery of candidate sensors The operations being developed now are for optical and radar sensors, but are extensible to Earth observation scientific sensors The design and implementation of the Magic Draw and ParaMagic FireSat SysML model interaction with AGI Components will be refined a nd then extended to other SysML tools The FireSat SysML model interaction with AGI Components proof of concept is also intended to provide the blueprint for the design and implementation of other types of SysML modeling of space based missions R EFERENCES   Docum e nt 07-014r3 at  http://www.opengeospatial.org   M a nas B a jaj, \223SLIM A C o l l a borat i v e, M odel B a sed Systems Engineering Work space for Next-Generation Complex System\224, 2011 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings, March 5-12, 2011 B IOGRAPHY  Dave Kaslow is Director, Product Data Management at Analytical Graphics, Inc.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
