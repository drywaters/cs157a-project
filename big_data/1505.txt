12 1 I NTRODUCTION Free space optical FSO communication systems operate by sending a modulated laser beam through a channel which is either totally through the atmosphere such as in the case of terrestrial and airborne communications or at least partly through the atmosphere such as in the case of earth to satellite communication Atmospheric turbulence affects the quality of the laser beam arriving at the receiver in nearly all cases though if the path length is suf\002ciently short the effects on communications quality are negligible However as the turbulence strength or the propagation distance increases the effects of turbulence at the receiver become stronger  3 The o v erall goal of our research program is to develop techniques for extending the useful range of free-space 
optical FSO communication systems which have both the transmitter and the receiver immersed in atmospheric turbulence We are examining both adaptive optics at the transmitter and channel coding strategies in conjunction with an experimental program to gather data on turbulence effects In this paper we focus on the turbulence measurement system and present results of our measurement and data processing system The remainder of this paper is organized as follows In the next section we present the experimental system developed to study the performance of a free-space laser communication channel providing a detailed description of the transmitter and the receiver The software developed to pro1 


vide a web-based interface for collecting laser propagation data from a wave front sensor remotely is discussed in Section 3  Results and discussions are presented in Section 4  and possible future work is outlined in Section 5  2 S YSTEM D ESIGN The FSO communication channel consists of a laser and LED transmitters telescope receiver WFS and a CCD camera The laser transmitter incorporates an 808 nm laser diode module with an adjustable power control to obtain the desired 003ux density at the receiver The LED transmitter is equipped with a bank of 14 horizontally in-line mounted LEDs The frontsensing receiver is located 3046 m away from the transmitter In order to accurately measure the turbulence-induced distortions the wave front sensor must be calibrated To achieve a reliable calibration of the wave front sensor the distance between the transmitter and the receiver was precisely measured using two independent surveying techniques the 002rst uses a range\002nder of geodetic total station and the second implements the relative positioning real-time kinematic global positioning system GPS technique Both transmitter and receiver are at an approximate elevation of 250 m above mean sea level The portion of the propagation path that is over water has a strong in\003uence on the index of refraction 003uctuations depending on the time of day and season of the year and therefore allows exploring a wide range of turbulence conditions Next we provide the details of the experimental system design of the transmitter and the receiver Transmitter A picture of the transmitter setup is shown in Fig 1 Fig 1 shows all the components integrated in the transmitter and Fig 2 provides the view from the top and demonstrates all possible directions of adjustment required for the proper alignment of the transmitter and the receiver The transmitter uses a semiconductor laser operating at a wavelength of 025  808 nm and the laser power is adjustable from 0  5 to 13 mW The 0  5 mm diameter energy-pro\002le shaping pinhole mounts on the output of the laser head and provides a footprint of a laser beam of approximately 3  5 m on at the receiver In order to provide a precise alignment of the transmitter and the receiver a targeting scope was incorporated in the transmitter assembly Before being brought to the 002eld the targeting scope is prealligned with the laser source in the lab The laser source mounts on a secondary rotation stage which permits the alignment of the laser and the targeting scope to the same point in space The laser-targeting scope assembly is placed on a two-stage base consisting of a rail with a slider and a primary platform rotation stage This base assembly provides an additional four levels of freedom up and down left and right for the 002nal alignment of the transmitter and the receiver The second transmitter consists of 14 horizontally in-line mounted LEDs is mounted above the laser transmitter and is used for anisoplanitism studies This paper emphasizes the results obtained from WFS measurements and therefore the detailed description of the LED Figure 1  Transmitter:Extended view Figure 2  Transmitter:View from the top shows directions of adjustments required for proper alignment of the transmitter with the receiver transmitter is omitted here Receiver The two-channel receiver shown in Fig 3 incorporates a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope with an entrance pupil diameter D  0  28 m and the focal distance f  2  8 m The converging beam falls on beamsplitter 1 which splits into WFS and PSF channels In order to reduce the internal re\003ection from the secondary surface of the beamsplitter we implemented a 1 inch pellicle beamspitter The beam entering the WFS beam-train is collimated using a relay lens with a focal length f r  75 mm The WFS relay system nominal magni\002cation is calculated to be 37  33  The collimated beam falls on the lenslet array of a ShackHartmann sensor.The light focussed by the micro lenses falls on a CCD camera By processing the location of the focal spot from each lenslet it is then possible to determine the local wavefront tilt Subsequent analysis of all facets to2 


Figure 3  Receiver:Extended view gether leads to determination of the overall wave front form In the current arrangement we use a 1 inch diameter lenslet array The lens array consists of 65 by 65 lenses with a pitch of d l  400 026 m and a lenslet focal distance f l  24 mm To capture the output of the WFS we implemented a Photometrics Cascade 512F CCD camera The camera uses an e2v CCD87 front-illuminated frame-transfer CCD having 512 by 512 pixels of d d  16 026 m square pitch With d l  400 026 m pitch of the lenslet and d d  16 026 m pitch of the CCD camera the number of CCD pixels across the diameter of the lenslets is equal to 25  A detailed view of the WFS-CCD camera system assembly is shown in Fig 4 In the current setup we implemented easily interchangeable neutral density 002lters to reduce the intensity of incoming radiation if required Infrared 002lters are placed between the lenslet and CCD camera to 002lter out undesirable infrared radiation coming from the sun The lenslet-\002lter assembly is located on a dual stage which allows us to control the horizontal displacements of the lenslet for focusing and alignment purposes as well as to rotate the lenslet relative to the CCD camera to perform rotational alignment The entire WFS-CCD camera system assembly shown in Fig 4 is solidly attached to a four-stage adjustment system which allows us to perform transverse rotation transverse sliding longitudinal sliding and vertical sliding displacements all of which are required for the precise alignment of the WFS-CCD camera system assembly with the beam-train of the WFS channel The visual/PSF channel is designed for anisoplanatism studies Depending on the end-channel sensor and the relay optics this channel can perform different measurements Implementing a relay lens to resize the incoming beam from the pellicle beamsplitter 1 and a Dragon Fly CCD camera the real-time visual data can be obtained On the other hand implementing focusing lens and a single photo detector ampli\002ed PDA the measurements of the point spread function PSF can be performed in real-time and with high speed Figure 4  Receiver:Details of the WFS assembly Improving Vibration Compensation For the systems similar to those described in this paper it is important to account for the external disturbances which may cause undesirable misalignment of the entire system and result in incorrect data In order to determine possible sources of external disturbances and how much and what type of motion is observed at each location acceleration data was collected at each site for multiple days A Tablet PC running NI's Sound and Vibration Assistant software with a N I 000 9234 USB acquisition device was used with two accelerometers A seismic  10 V g  uniaxial accelerometer and a DC  1 V g  triaxial accelerometer were used at each location The system collected data for 48 consecutive hours at each test location There is apparent motion at both locations measured at the optical assembly benches Vibration of the laser source shows excitation due to a number of different devices which would require more investigation to determine their exact source There are vibration sources that are only observed during the daytime hours and others that are in operation throughout the entire day The collecting telescope also experiences excitation from a number of building sources depending on the time of day The most dominant lateral motion is observed at 9 Hz for the collecting telescope and is likely to be a resonance of the table rather than due to an outside excitation source Since the observed vibrations were low frequency components design options for lowering motion excitation to the collecting telescope setup were explored in order to reduce any possible effects It was decided to place the optical table holding the collecting telescope and associated pieces of measurement equipment onto pneumatic-vibration isolated piers to insulate it from low vibrations Calibration and SNR To obtain accurate results of the wave front reconstruction the entire system must be precisely aligned and precalibrated The system alignment consists of several stages with some of them done in the laboratory and some performed in the 002eld environment The initial alignment of the WFS and the CCD 3 


camera is done in the laboratory environment using regular He-Ne laser This allows for the lenslet positioning with respect to the CCD camera detector plane and performs focusing parallelization as well as rotation alignment along CCD matrix rows The next step is to attach the prealigned WFSCCD assembly to the telescope by means of prealigned relay optics Finally all the parts of the system must be aligned with respect to the telescope optical axis Once the physical alignment is performed the calibration procedure takes place We developed a calibration technique to remove the effects of deterministic errors in the Hartmann wave front sensor The sources of these errors include Spatial dislocation between the lenslet array and the camera deterministic global tilt and higher-order errors due to aberrations in the optical system The calibration of a Hartmann wave front sensor is done by measuring a reference image which encodes the centroid displacements from their ideal locations due to the 002xed errors in the system Since the exact alignment of the lenslet array to the camera is imperfectly known we developed a technique for shifting the average wave front sensor image to match the computer model of the wave front sensor Implementation of this technique allowed us to signi\002catively reduce the effects of the deterministic errors described above The signal-to-noise ratio SNR was evaluated under a conservative condition of lowest expected photon 003ux passing through the telescope aperture onto the CCD camera We found that the lowest expected photon 003ux in our experiment is equivalent to 030 2  7 001 10 8 photo-electrons in the CCD readout per pixel per 1 ms exposure for the minimal laser power of 1 mW measured at the emitter output which makes the CCD 15 e 000 readout noise contribution negligible photon limited regime We note that the above value of photon 003ux is larger than the CCD full well and in all conducted experiments the neutral density 002lters were used to reduce the 003ux falling on the detector More details on the hardware alignment calibration procedures and signal-to-noise ratio considerations can be found in[4 3 C ONTROL S OFTWARE AND D ATA C OLLECTION In this section we discuss the software that was developed to provide a web-based interface for remotely collecting laser propagation data from a wave front sensor The software is internet based and allows the user to collect data remotely from any computer as long as a high speed internet connection Java and LabVIEW 8  0 runtime engines are available The developed software package is very versatile with many different features embedded All the data gathered is stored and available online through a File Transfer Protocol FTP Server Since hosting a FTP server requires very little actual processor time this feature is hosted on the same computer that the data is taken on In case of power failure an uninterrupted power supply UPS has been installed to compensate for any minor power interruptions In case of power failure for more than 5 minutes the UPS initiates a batch script to turn off all hardware and shutdown the camera to protect the equipment from being damaged The software package can be initiated in advanced and simpli\002ed modes Fig 5 shows a screenshot of the experiment interface running in advanced mode In this mode all control parameters are accessible and can be changed by the user which allows for custom data collection Each data set is saved using an informative 002lename chosen to provide the details on the data collected Each 002lename consists of the data time exposure time total number of frames and laser/LED indication For example 223102809 0600 30ms 2000 SIGNAL.tiff\224 is the 002lename for 2000 frames of data recorded on 10  28  09 at 6 AM with an exposure time of 30 ms and the laser set to ON The next set of parameters are vital to the experiment to ensure accurate and precise data is recorded 223Interval Between Frames ms sets the time delay between successful camera exposures 223Exposure time s is the saturation time for the Cascade CCD camera 223Desired Number of Frames\224 gives the total number frames in that given dataset 223ReadOut Port\224 initializes one of the two ports Both ports produce the same image but Port 1 produces an image that is 003ipped about the y-axis 223Fast ADC\224 increases the ADC speed to 10 kHz or 5 kHz depending on the port being used 223Overlap Mode\224 is used in low light conditions to reduce the graininess caused by low light conditions 223Laser Control\224 initiates a batch script to turn the laser on and off depending on the type of experiment The visual/PSF channel is also controlled by LabVIEW 223Desired Number of Frames 2 224 sets the number of images to be collected by the DragonFly camera or PDA 223Shutter\224 is the adjustable shutter speed on the camera and is variable in case of low light conditions or high amounts of saturation A simpli\002ed interface shown in Fig 6 was developed to prevent user error The interface allows the user to enter the current date and time and initialize/terminate the data collection The advanced interface running on the background applies the parameters previously set by by users with suf\002cient experience To determine appropriate data collection parameters a suf\002cient amount of testing was performed varying 223Exposure Time\224 223Interval Between Frames\224 and 223Number of Frames\224 of the Cascade CCD camera We found the optimal values for the 223Exposure Time\224 and 223Interval Between Frames\224 are 10 ms and 100 ms consecutively The last parameter was determined allowing enough time for the camera frame rate without overlapping images caused by software limitations Because larger frame sets provide more accurate results 224Number of Frames\224 was established at 2000 frames each collection When the LabVIEW script is initiated data collection begins A batch script initiates the window to open by a motor controlled lever This opening takes about 80 seconds so a delay timer was implemented to satisfy this criteria During the delay time a script powers on the laser and/or LED 4 


Figure 6  The experiment interface running in simpli\002ed mode transmitters Next 1500 frames of data are collected with 223Exposure Time\224 set to 30 ms which is used to form the calibration vector described in Sec 3 Because of the extended length of data collection  3/4 hr a calibration vector is collected twice before and after the signal data Following the 1500 frames of signal data the background data is collected by executing a script that turns the laser and LED bar both off The background data is used to remove the DC component from the signal data Signal data which are further used for r 0 estimation was gathered in a series of three consecutive data sets with 2000 in each and the 224Exposure Time\224 set to 10 ms Similarly to the calibration vector data a script opens the window and turns the laser and/or LED transmitters on while the 80 s delay timer runs down After all required data sets have being collected the script terminates the software and turns all the equipment off The data were collected over a 50 day time interval and under various day and night atmospheric conditions during July and August of 2009  To explore different turbulence conditions the data was collected 5 times a day at 6 AM 10 AM 2 PM 7 PM and 11 PM Signal data was gathered in a series of three consecutive data sets with the exposure time of 10 ms As a result during a single day 15 independent data sets were collected 4 R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION Light passing through the turbulent atmosphere becomes distorted These distortions are caused by variations in the index of refraction along the optical path of the beam These variations are caused by turbulence-induced temperature 003uctuations in the atmosphere resulting in density changes The physical source of the index refraction variations in the atmosphere is temperature inhomogeneities arising from turbulent air motion.The index of refraction of the atmosphere n  000 r  t   is modeled as the sum of a mean index of refraction n 0  and a randomly 003uctuating term n 1  000 r  t  5 n  000 r  t   n 0  n 1  000 r  t  1 where 000 r is a three dimensional vector position and t is time The mean index of refraction of air is n 0  0  At optical wavelength the dependence of the index of refraction of air upon pressure and temperature is given by n 1  n 000 1  77  6 P T 002 10 000 6 2 where T is the temperature of air in Kelvins and P is the pressure of the air in millibars Temperature 003uctuations are the dominant source of index of refraction 003uctuations as can be seen by differentiating the above equation with respect to temperature dn 1 dT  000 77  6 P T 2 002 10 000 6 3 The impact of turbulence on an optical beam of a given path through the atmosphere is commonly characterized by the Fried parameter r 0  The Fried parameter r 0 is the aperture size beyond which further increases in its diameter result in no further increase in the resolution of an imaging system In this paper we present the results of obtaining the Fried parameter r 0 from the measurements Statistics of Fried parameter r 0 is derived from 6 TB of data collected over a 50 day time interval and under various day and night atmospheric conditions We use Eq 3 to correlate changes in r 0 based on the corresponding changes in temperature and pressure Further we use the results of r 0 estimation to calculate the structure constant C 2 n  h  for the geometry of interest Fried parameter estimation from the measurements Estimating r 0 is an important aspect of predicting the performance of the adaptive optics system We estimate r 0 from the WFS data using structure function of phase differences given by D xx 4 036  s   E f  4 x 036  x  000 4 x 036  x  s  2 g 4 The structure function of the turbulence-induced phases at 000 x and 000 x 0 given by 9 D 036  000 x  000 x 0   6  88  j 000 x 000 000 x 0 j r 0  5  3 5 In Eq 5 the dependence of the structure function D 036  000 x  000 x 0  on the Fried parameter r 0 is clearly indicated Estimating r 0 from WFS data requires an implementation of a sampledbased computational approach to estimate D xx 4 036  s  for the measured data We estimate r 0 by using an optimizationbased approach by forming the objective function J  e r 0   X allseparations  D xx;measured 4 036  s  000 D xx 4 036  s e r 0  2 6 5

the temperature dropped from 80 o F to 70 o F and the average atmospheric pressure especially at the beginning of August was signi\002catively lower In fact similar atmospheric conditions were present during the beginning of July also impacting the values of r 0  To visualize the signi\002cant 003uctuations of r 0 during the day we provide the tabulated values of r 0 for the selected dates in Fig 9 and Fig 10 From the date represented in Fig 9 it can be observed that r 0 can 003uctuate as much as 50 percent within 10 minutes The data for 8  11 shows the value of r 0 less than one millimeter which is due to foggy atmospheric conditions In Fig 9 we also provide r 0 values estimated from the measurements taken at 2 AM on 7  27  7  28  and 7  29  In Fig 10 four graphs on the left show r 0 003uctuations during the day for the selected days and four weather graphs on the right demonstrate hourly 003uctuations in temperature pressure and wind speed for the corresponding days Obtaining the structure constant C 2 n  h  using estimated r 0 The structure constant C 2 n  h  characterizes the strength of the index of refraction 003uctuations In this section we obtain the structure constant C 2 n  h  using estimated r 0 and compare this result with the theoretical value of the Hufnagel-Valley pro\002le for the C 2 n  h  given by C 2 n  h   5  94 002 10 000 53  035 27 2 h 10 e 000 h 1000  2

represents the high altitude wind speed Typical values for the A and 035 are 1  7 002 10 000 14 m 000 2  3 and 21 m/s respectively The calculated value of the structure constant C 2 n  h  for the altitude of 250 m is 1  6240 002 10 000 15  The Fried parameter r 0 for the spherical wave propagation through the distance L is given by 7 8 r 0  0  185  4 031 2 k 2 R dz  L 000 z L  5  3 C 2 n  z

laser beam which are relevant to optical communications are a broadening of the laser footprint random jitter of the laser beam and high spatial frequency intensity 003uctuations referred to as scintillation The overall goal of our program is to improve performance and extend the range of optical communications systems by exploring the use of adaptive optics and channel coding To better model the performance of a real system operating in the real world we have developed an outdoor turbulence measurement and monitoring system This research project consists of several phases In Phase I

completed all three phases obtaining signi\002cant a database of statistical data for r 0 derived from 6 TB of data collected over 50 days and under various day and night atmospheric conditions Signi\002cant 003uctuations of r 0 are found with the values ranging from 2 mm and up to 15 cm We also found that the structure constant C 2 n  h  characterizes the strength of the index of refraction 003uctuation varies signi\002cantly from 7  4 002 10 000 14 to 8  1 002 10 000 16  while the theoretically obtained value for C 2 n 250 m  is 1  6240 002 10 000 15  For future work we plan to estimate

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
