227The Center for Technological Information and Communications \(CTIC\ at the National University of Engineering \(UNI for its initials in Spanish\ in Lima, Peru is in charge of the design of a national concept for the implementation of a Network of ground stations for small satellite missions. Currently CTIC conducts investigation on how to carry out this challenging project for the country and for the Peruvian industry. The main idea of the proposed network shall be supported not only by Peruvian government institutions, but also by national and international universities 12  The establishment of such a program has already been started and a couple of Eur opean entities and universities are interested in becoming co-partn er within the project. The ground stations will be located 
in remote places in Peru thus providing wide communication coverage, permitting longer contact capabilities between the satellite and the ground, and creating a complex space and ground based system. A network including these places will cover a landscape area larger than 1.5 Mio Km2. In general small satellites use a low data rate downlink. Due to less number of access and low power capacity the usage of an UHF transmitter is the only possibility The proposed network will widen the contact possibility with the satellites and this way there will be more opportunity to dump a higher amount of data. Since the communication system for small satellites are developing in a rapid pace, this network woul d be beneficial to dump data faster and it will have the option to collect and distribute data in an effective manner for the users. This will allow 
generating more accurate data from the instruments or from the spacecraft itself. The networ k will be implemented, at a first level, with UHF band antennas and in the future will be translated for S-band ante nnas. This network will be functional for the Peruvian small satellite program and also for all the missions that currently work with and use UHF band antennas     1 978-1-4244-3888-4/10/$25.00 \2512010 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper#1672, Vers ion 1, Updated 2009:12:29 T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1

Due to the restricted opportunities in launching, small satellites are usually launched as secondary payloads through a piggy 
back manner. As a result, durin g the early orbit phase, it is likely that several small satellites may be clustered in space and frequency  M o re ove r  th e contact time may be very limited due to the ambiguity in orbit prediction at this phase As a result, the workload at the ground station for the tracking of a satellite in early orbit phase is often overwhelming Recently, ma been develope d a n d intended to be launched to take advantage of short development time, miniature devices, standard launcher interfaces, and piggy-back launch opportunities. Many missions including collaborative Earth observation can be realized through the design of CubeSats and their constellation. However, a problem associated with Pico satellites operations is that the communication frequencies 
typically in the UHF/VHF band, are very close between two different satellites. As many CubeSats will be released in one launch, the proximity in spatial and spectral separation between those may render problems for ground stations in satellite tracking, especially in the early orbit phase. Even when there is a contact, it may be difficult for a ground station to know which satellite is actually pointed at by the ground station antenna. The station may have to resolve the desired signal out of a class of near-by interferences [3   Also, the frequency overlap due to Doppler shift, clock drift and operation error aggravate the tracking problem. If a contact with the satellite fails and the station wants to search 


 2 the signal again, it often needs to wait for the next contact And the gap between two contacts is usually several hours even one day long Taking the above mentioned topics into consideration the Center for Technological Information and Communications CTIC\e National Univers ity of Engineering \(UNI\ in Lima, Peru has attempted to design a ground station network, which is called the Peruvian Satellite Network PSN\edicated at a first stage to support small satellite missions. In this paper, six \(6\round station installations across Peru has been taken into contemplation and analyzed the possibilities of overcoming different issues with regard to small satellites. Also the economics behind the development of such infrastructure is presented in this paper 2  G ROUND S TATION  A ground station consists of a set of equipments, facilities and software for achieving communication between the ground and the satellite. The satellite can be our own CubeSat [4 CHASQUI 3 or any other satellite using one of the frequency bands supported by the equipment The main functions of a ground station are Tracking\227 to hear the satellite's b eacon in order to know its position and identity Telemetry\227 to state variables acq uisition \(temperature voltage, etc.\ order to monitoring the satellite and  determine its operational parameters Command\227 to issue orders to the satellite, such as system reset, taking pictures, etc The core components of a Peruvian ground station will be 200  Transceiver ICOM IC-910H \(VHF/UHF 200  Power supply for transceiver PS-125 200  Two pre amplifiers \(for VHF and for UHF 200  Antenna rotor YAESU G-5500 200  ARS-El interface for the rotor 200  Two X-Quad antennas, one for VHF \(2 m\, other for UHF \(70 cm 200  Two lightning arrestors, two phasing harnesses cables and connectors, etc Some additional equipment is also considered like 200  Two LCD displays for orbit visualization and telemetry monitoring 200  Fast Ethernet Switches and Cat5e cables for network access   3 CHASQUI is the name of the C ubeSat developed by the National University of Engineering \(UNI\.

 3 Software for the Ground Station The operations of the ground station will need not only hardware, but one or more software products with following characteristics 200  Direct human control for console or GUI 200  Remote control or Tele-Operation enabled 200  Advanced commands available 200  Ability to receive files and format data 200  Ability to read telemetry data 200  Ability to configure and monitor the equipment especially transceiver and rotor 200  Radio tuning, to correct Doppler Effect 200  If possible, some form of automatic control or 223automatic pilot\224  For the first months, the first ground station \(currently planned to be located and implemented in the Peruvian capitol, Lima\llow and monitor the CubeSat of our partner, the Technical University of Berlin. They use an executable program that controls in remote the ground station, by implementing a TCP \(Transfer control protocol server. For the software design, we are evaluating 3 options the Mercury GS, the GENSO software, and our in-house software development. Mercury GS is Open Source and it has been used successfully, but it is old and it has to be adapted for modern versions of Linux, Java, and other SW programs. GENSO S/W looks promising but, at the moment of writing this article, has not been released yet, and of course it has no previous history of success. In-house development provides more control on the functionalities but it will take more time to develop this tool 3  N ETWORK D ESCRIPTION  The Peruvian Satellite Network consists of six \(6 ground stations located in strategic places around the Peruvian territory. A networ k including these places will cover a landscape area larger than 1.5 Mio Km2. The cities where the ground stations will be situated are listed in Table 2 and shown in Figure 2 Table 2 Location of the Ground Stations in Peru  Ground Stations City Location in Peru Iquitos North East  Lima Central West \(Pacific Coast Piura North West \(Pacific Coast Pucallpa Central East Puerto Maldonado South East Tacna South West \(Pacific Coast Privileged Location One very important aspect of our first ground station in Lima is that it is geographically well placed. There is no other academic ground station in the Central-Western part of the South Pacific region. Furthermore any satellite crossing the South American continent will be passing over the PSN network  Figure 2 226 Position of the Ground Stations The coverage area of the PSN network corresponds to an approximately of 50 Million Km2  Figure 3 \226 PSN Coverage Area \(using Google Earth Network Topology For our network the preferred network topology is the so called Bus topology. With this topology it is possible to guarantee the functionality of the network in case of one or more stations might fail. Furthermore the Bus topology is 


 4 more economical an efficient than other kind of network topologies. At a first stage of the project the connection between all the stations or nodes will be supported through the internet. All the nodes will have a wide band internet connection. Using this nowadays available infrastructure it is possible to implement the PSN network without extra costs for the connectivity between the stations installations At an advanced stage a dedicated and faster connection will be implemented to have a very efficient and secure system The ground stations should be able to work independent from each other and there will be no prime station. All of them will have the same characteristics and importance. The system must be transparent, by doing the handover from one station to the other or when one of the stations fails. Each station stores the collected data. After a contact all the stations exchange the data from each other and merge this so that each node has the w hole amount of data after the contact, archived it for analysis and documentation Considering the magnitude and importance of this challenging project for edu cational purposes, the CTIC envisages the involvement of other Peruvian universities to support the network. The following universities will participate in the project Table 3 Peruvian Universities in the PSN  City University Iquitos Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana Lima Universidad Nacional de Ingenier\355a Piura Universidad de Piura Pucallpa Universidad Nacional de Ucayali Puerto Maldonado Universidad Nacional Amaz\363nica de Madre de Dios Tacna Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre G  4  G ROUND N ETWORK A NALYSIS  The Center for Technological Information and Communications at the National University of Engineering is taking all the effort to establish the ground network among selected ground stations in Peru. The coordinates of the existing stations are as shown below in table 4 Table 4 Ground Station Coordinates  Ground Station Latitude Longitude Iquitos 3 45' 0" S 73 15' 0" W Lima 12 2' 36" S 77 1' 42" W Piura 5 12' 0" S 80 38' 0" W Pucallpa 8 23' 0" S 74 33' 0" W Puerto Maldonado 12 36' 0" S 69 11' 0" W Tacna 18 3' 20" S 70 14' 54" W Access Duration After choosing different ground stations available, in order to have a complete database, the access time, which is the time of communication between the spacecraft and the ground, has been calculated to decide the effective ways to share the data from the ground stations and also to have redundant backup downlink. This kind of network will reduce the amount of data lost during the contact. For the study purpose, the software Satellite Tool Kit \(STK\was used to simulate different combinations to calculate the number of access times and access duration Figure 4 shows in terms of calculated access duration the PSN coverage area  Figure 4 226 Ground Station Coverage \(using STK As before mentioned, the PSN network consists of the stations located in Lima, Iquitos, Piura, Pucallpa, Puerto Maldonado, and Tacna. The chosen locations of the ground stations are from all corners of Peru. The STK tool was used to perform the calculations of access times between the satellite and the ground stations for different orbits and inclinations considering that the satellite cannot communicate with the ground du ring eclipse and elevation angle below 10  The results have been recorded by month over a period of one year and all these access times have been plotted in order to easily determine effectiveness of this network. The access duration depends on the altitude of the satellite and elevation of the ground station Table 5 illustrates the maximum and the average access time each ground station could provi de per pass. The altitude of the satellite \(here as Chasqui 1 to 4\ assumed for the analysis varies between 400 and 1000 Km \(Low Earth Orbit\with a scale of 200 Km  


 5  Table 5 Access Duration Calculation   The analysis shows the maximu m and the average time to be the same for all the stations irrespective of the ground stations location. The number of effective contacts per day will make the difference in a ground station network Number of Access The number of access is the effec tive number of entries into the coverage area of the ground station. Similar conditions were considered for the simula tion of the effective number of contacts per day. The below table 6 illustrates the access events per day over individual ground stations in Peru Table 6 Average Number of Access/Day  The number of access varies based on the altitude and the inclination. Since the small satellites are most predominantly launched in the sun synchronous orbit hence an inclination of between 95 to 105 has been assumed for this simulation. Taking the eclipse period and the sun period into account, the number of access reduces effectively between 2 to 4 passes a day in view of individual ground station The plot depicted in Figure 5 gives a scheme of the average number of passes taking place over each ground station Considering the ISS orbital elements the number of access varies between 3 to 6 contacts per day with contact duration between 490 and 540 sec  Figure 5 226 Daily Planning of Contacts Elevation >10\260 Data Rate The data rate is the number of bits transferred from one system to another system. The data rates are quantified using bits per second. For the above study work, the commonly used data rate for small satellites has been considered ranging between 1200 bps to 154000 bps. In terms of cubesats, the specified date rate is to a maximum of 9600 bps, due to the power constraints. The small satellites are of low payload carriers, of which most of the cubesat missions are realized with cameras for remote sensing operations. Few of the recently launched satellites carry equipment for attitude control but still the power consumption is one of the parameters that need to be reiterated. With the calculated access time and the assumed data rate, the analysis shows a maximum of 90 Kbytes that could be downloaded per contact. The major scientific data consumes few Mega Bytes of data per data-take. Using various compression techniques the data could be compressed to range of Kbytes. The major concern for the transfer is the data losses during the link and the next is the effective contact duration per day. Assuming two \(2\ata takes will probably lead to data content of 200 Kbytes inclusive of the house keeping data. Comparing the data accumulated with the given data rate of 1200 bps, the calculation shows a requirement of approx. 1400 sec of contact per day Conclusions The above study shows the individual capabilities of the ground station. In view of all the 6 ground stations the network gives a considerable di fference in the results of the above criterions. Similar access studies with different orbital conditions were considered. The ground station locations are wide spread across Peru hence the area of coverage gets Access Duration    Max/Avg sec Chasqui1 400Km Chasqui2 600Km Chasqui3 800Km Chasqui4 1000Km Iquitos 602/487 761/603 906/674 1045/845 Lima 600/433 762/575 907/667 1044/817 Piura 602/445 761/602 907/681 1043/829 Pucallpa 603/445 762/587 905/650 1041/786 Puerto Maldonado 602/445 762/589 906/696 1043/762 Tacna 603/435 763/580 907/673 1045/829 No. of contacts    Avg No of Contacts Chasqui 1 400Km Chasqui 2 600Km Chasqui 3 800Km Chasqui 4 1000Km Iquitos 4 4 4 5 Lima 4 4 5 6 Piura 4 4 4 5 Pucallpa 4 5 5 6 Puerto Maldonado  4 5 4 6 Tacna 4 5 5 5 


 6 a direct impact due to this. The increase in the coverage varies between 30 - 50% when all the ground stations work in tandem. This leads to increase in time duration per access. The average access time increases between 60 and 140 sec than the average time covered by a single ground station A 21 days simulation cycle in STK shows an increase in the number of access when all the ground stations are active The number of access increase by one extra pass on an average per day. Most important factor is the redundancy in receiving the data. Most of the small satellite missions especially Cubesats work on low bit rates. The probability of receiving bad telemetry is high and hence the communication protocols need to be well scripted to attain the telemetry data in a best possible way. The Peruvian Satellite Network cleans up all the constraints by having redundant stations for the reception of the data. The other aspect for bad telemetry is the attitude control being used for the small satellites missions. Most of the CubeSats use the permanent magnets to cont rol its attitude in space. The latest development in CubeSats is the use of reaction wheels or magneto- torques. Still the usage of such attitude systems is yet to be verified for full effectiveness. The attitude system plays an important role in supporting the satellite to communicate with the ground st ation. Even though the permanent magnets are used to arrest the tumbling in 2 axes it still tumbles in all 3 axes, which leads to loss of contact and bad telemetry The proposed satellite network could solve the issues discussed above by having redundant ground stations to support the contact and could also reduce the time loss due to bad telemetry process. The minimum number of ground stations that could support the contact is two \(2\. This PSN network will end up more beneficial to the Peruvian small satellite program also ultimately have effects on the economical return GENSO, a project of the Eu ropean Space Agency \(ESA and coordinated by ESA\222s Education Office, aims to increase the return from edu cational space missions by forming a worldwide network of ground stations and spacecraft which can interact via a softwa  The proposal to join the GENSO network to support the CubeSat missions worldwide is under consideration and the Chasqui team is coordinating this with the respective GENSO members 5  F UTURE W ORK  The Peruvian satellite network will be upgraded in a near future. The ground stations will be expanded in the S-Band To avoid high investment at the beginning the National University of Engineering will begin to build small scale antennas. The first design will use a 3m antenna. The size of these antennas is good enough to support small satellites missions. Later 5m antennas will be used to further enhance the system.  With this kind of ground stations and the network solution proposed in this paper, it is possible to support pico, nano and even microsatellite missions Microsatellites use normally S-Band transmitters \(they can also use UHF depending on the mission and the budget The National University of Engineering envisages building a microsatellite as the next step and for this reason it is necessary to prepare the nece ssary infrastructure for that The higher the cost the longer it takes to put together the planned infrastructure. But the earlier the infrastructure is available the faster we will be able to support satellite missions and compete internationally in this promising area 6  C OMMERCIAL A SPECT  At a first stage, the Peruvian Satellite Network is planned to make usage of UHF antennas. The UHF ground stations are not too expensive for their acquisition. Nowadays to build an UHF ground station it is necessary to invest around 10,000. This price includes th e receptor, the antenna itself the motor for the antenna and the PCs to control it. For six ground stations it is then necessary to invest around 60,000. This is at an affordable investment. We have to see that this network is a powerful tool for any university to complete its Space Engineering Faculty, as it is intended by the UNI The plan is to upgrade and further implement the ground stations with others antennas. The next generation will be a group of S-Band antennas. The first S-Band antenna will have a 3m dish. The cost of this kind of ground station is around $125,000. This upgraded ground station will use the same connection like the UHF grou nd station. For the future a wide band connection will be implemented. For the six ground stations the investment will be around $750,000 


 7  Figure 6 226 3m S-Band Antenna The next step will be to build an station with 5m antennas Each ground station would cost around $500,000 and together $3`000,000. This investment is very high for an university but its implementation means to have a very powerful network system to offer and to support small satellites missions  Figure 7 226 5m S-Band Antenna 7  C ONCLUSIONS  As a result of this study wo rk, the comparison shows an increase in the number of effective contacts per day and the contact time. Since the ground stations work in tandem, the network gives a benefit of redundant data dumping. The possibility of using CCSDS protocols for CubeSat missions and other satellite missions may give the flexibility for the costumer to use the network to the fullest. The greatest challenge for a small satellite mission is its attitude system and such unstable satellite could be support at its best. The Peruvian Satellite Network could be used to join global ground system networks like GENSO to support multiple CubeSat missions. Comparing the commercial aspects, the outcome of this project probably helps the Peruvian space community to a great extent. Parallel passes could be supported quite easily. Currently this project is proposed based on focusing Pico, Nano and Microsatellite missions As a future development, the S-band system could also lead to create new partner among the satellite operations community A CKNOWLEGMENTS  The project management team would like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Glen Rodriguez, the students of his working group and advisors involved, who participated in the edition of this paper.

  9 misalignments when they are small, which shows that this sequence works well when the misalignments are already reduced by the above mitigation method Furthermore, the effects of the distribution of the stars into the images and misalignments are calculated. The algorithm using two star trackers is shown to give a good performance because it can compensate th e bad observability around the main axis in the case of using only one star tracker In conclusion, the algorithm proposed in this paper works very well if we can estimate the misalignments accurately in the initial operation phase.

EIS Architecture Design Task Implementation EIS Architecture Design tasks may be supported by existing tools [20]. Systems Modeling Language \(SysML 15] is considered as the most appropriate for EIS System Network model representation and requirement engineering, since it supports the concepts of requirements and resource allocation. As a direct consequence, SysML allows the representation of requirements as model elements which means that requirements are part of the system architecture. For representation purposes, a SysML pro?le for EIS System Network meta-model \(?gure 6 mented as a plugin to MagicDraw modeling tool [2]. In order to facilitate model exchangeability, EIS System Network model is being realized in XML, which is a standard exchangeable format. In order to exchange data with speci?c software tools, model transformations will be accomplished through appropriate XSLTs developed for each tool for example as the one transforming XMI to the EIS System Network document type description \(DTD 5. Case Study In the following we discuss the case of renovating a legacy information system supporting a large-scale public organization based on the proposed concepts. The organization supports more than 350 interconnected regional of?ces and its main purpose is to provide services to the public both citizens and businesses. Regional of?ces are divided into three categories according to their size and information infrastructure requirements \(large, medium and small More than 15.000 employees work in the organization having on-line access to the legacy system. There are more than 300 different services provided to the public, while each citizen is required to register in the one belonging to his/her residential area, called residential of?ce. Some of them require the actual presence of citizens in their residential of?ce Existing system architecture is based on a fat clientserver architecture. All application logic is programmed within the client platform, while data is distributed in local database servers located in each regional of?ce. A Central database is supported in the Datacenter for data synchronization and lookup purposes. The Datacenter and all regional of?ces participate in a private TCP/IP network to facilitate ef?cient data replication. Most data related to a speci?c citizen are maintained as local data in his/her residential of?ce. Client programs access the local database to store data, while they access the central database mostly for lookup purposes. Local data are asynchronously replicated in the central database using a transaction management system \(TMS Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 to facilitate communication with the central database. The central database provides the overall view of each citizen  s record 


record To enhance the level of services provided by the organization, we decided to establish an enhanced e-services environment through an e-government portal. The main target of the portal is to minimize the need for citizen  s presence in regional of?ces and intents to deal with all the drawbacks of the current e-service platform. It provides easy access to citizens and businesses twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. It also promotes the increase of e-services to users, facilitating the organization to accomplish its strategic goals. The portal facilitates on-line transactional services and ensures on-line access to the databases of the legacy information system Provision of transactional e-services re?ects the operation of the legacy system and thus results in its renovation. In order to effectively support both systems \(e.g the portal and the legacy system able to apply the same policies and minimize maintenance cost. Thus, it was decided to explore the renovation of the legacy information system by adopting modern technological trends, such as multi-tiered application architecture server-based computing and light clients. It was decided also to rewrite application code based on J2EE architecture to develop a web interface for the legacy information system in order to support a uni?ed environment for both the legacy system and the portal. This decision affected the legacy system architecture, described in System Network View. Some of issues raised included: \(a database architecture? It is currently distributed. Should it become centralized? What are the implications in the network infrastructure? \(b complished to minimize maintenance cost Though EA was never fully described, the organization had already decided to establish an EA based on Zachman framework a few years ago. RUPmethodology was used for software development, thus application description models were developed within Rational Rose platform. In order to be able to apply the proposed tasks identi?ed in section 4, relative information had to be extracted from the corresponding cells. Application description \(e.g. applications and modules tracted from corresponding Rational Rose ?les. Though the process was not automated, the provision of System Network meta-model, helped architecture designer to identify the information needed to obtain from software designers Detailed service description in terms of load requirements could not be extracted from software description. This was crucial in order to decide upon Intranet and Datacenter architecture. This information was collected by interviewing software developers The new system has to deal with a number of require&lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Small Regional Office oracle L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt tuxido L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt L.R.O. department tuxido Central

Topology View - Existing System ments, with security and availability being the most important ones. Security issues have to do with the security of the network, security of data, authentication control, etc. Availability requirements deal with the backup subsystem, the recovery system and high availability UPS. Privacy must be enforced with the use of cryptography and compression techniques. All these requirements were identi?ed during the System Architecture design process and consequently exported in System Motivation cell where all system requirements are gathered using a simpli?ed text-based requirement description method System Architecture design tasks were performed by existing tools already described in [20]. The existence of System Network meta-model and its implementation in XML facilitated tool integration and interoperability. The identi?cation of primary EIS engineering activities served by Zachman matrix rows and columns facilitated a better understanding between software developers, architecture designers and organization management and enhanced discrete methodology integration. Existing and renovated application architecture of the legacy system de?ned by Topology View are presented in ?gures 7 and 8 respectively. The screenshots are from the MagicDraw [2] tool, enhanced with EIS pro?le to provide the appropriate functionality 6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work MB-EISE process based on Zachman framework was explored in the paper. The designer may adjust basic MB-EISE activity model for each cell, formulate a methodology-independent EIS cell-related view, and ?nally identify methods and tools appropriate for implementing each speci?c task. One could argue that in such a case, 36 distinct EIS sub-views should be de?ned, each of them being rather complex, while basic MB-EISE activity should be adjusted 36 times, resulting in a very complicated process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Application Server lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt

Topology View - Renovated System However, EIS engineering process, as enterprise architecture, is itself complex. The bene?t of the proposed approach is that all aspects \(simple or complex form and modular fashion. Cell-related sub-views and corresponding meta-models, as well as cell-related MB-EISE activity model may be progressively formed according to the designer  s priorities and perspectives Having a black-box view of each Zachman cell, the proposed approach focuses on EIS view integration and interview consistency. The notion of external entities when de?ning EIS cell-related views provides the means for interoperability with external cells, while at the same time facilitates atomicity within the limits of each cell. We are currently emphasizing Business and System rows, and especially Function and Network cells, exploring in parallel Motivation column and the way non-functional requirements are managed Having a white-box view of each Zachman cell, it is evident that the de?nition of a technology neutral metamodel and the identi?cation of basic engineering tasks, corresponding to EIS cell-related views, contributes to the integration of different methodologies and tools. A library of EIS System Network models has been already implemented in XML.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
