227 Spacecraft formations offer interesting c hallenges to orbit determination especially for groundbased tracking In fact the limited distances between spacecraft and the possible ambiguity of the observables gathered from the ground have an impact on the solution process. The paper aims to apply the filtering techniques on a refined dynamical model which can include the main perturbation effects - due to the oblateness of the Earth and at the lower altitudes the air drag  on spacecraft trajectories representing them in series with a remarkably limited number of terms even in eccentric case. The idea is to focus on theoretically expected behavior rather than dealing with an enriched but heavier state including 
parameters directly related to the perturbing effects. In such a way it could be possible to obtain a good estimate even with limited spacecraft tracking information This is an important asset in navigating a formation from the Earth due to the needed partition of ground station resources among different platforms belonging to the formation, and to the possible ambiguity among the measurements which further reduce the available data. The specific nature of the dynamic model calls for an estimator with a flexible and 224open\224 architecture easily allowing for changes and additions in the model itself Therefore the estimator selected for testing the approach has been the Unscented Kalman Filter versatile enough to allow for increasing model accuracy without the need for tedious computation of 
the Jacobian This approach is also intended to offer a different way to investigate special perturbed configurations via the semianalytical and almost exact representation of the trajectories In such a perspective one of the first application which is shortly outlined in the paper will be the analysis of spacecraft formations under the J2 effect In fact recent studies identified a set of almost periodic relative configurations among the spacecraft This set sometimes referred as the special or magical inclination\222s one\ has been recently identified by means of numeric search, and has also received some partial explanation Due to the interest in control effort reduction it is deemed that a better understanding of this special dynamics possibly provided 
by means of a selected modeling approach, can be of some interest T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1   I NTRODUCTION 1  2  T HE A PPROACH A RCHITECTURE 2  3  D YNAMICS M ODEL 2  4  UKF  E STIMATOR 4  5  A PPLICATION OF THE TECHNIQUE TO THE S PECIAL

with respect to tracking from ground the overall formation become quite appealing However such an approach requires the availability of GPS receivers on board all the spacecraft as well as bi-directional inter-satellite data links and a computation capability for at least one of the elements Therefore non-autonomous i.e ground-based techniques still maintain a remarkable interest, both as a back-up or as a basic asset for loose formation where continuous accurate navigation is not an issue  The paper moves from the concept that a better estimation even with a small number of available measurements, can be obtained if the data are matched to a more accurate model Typically, the influence of the perturbations is considered by 
introducing process noise in the filter or, at a more accurate level by introducing perturbation models in Newton equations Moreover these additions are usually performed on the linearized formulations which in the formation case are the largely used Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations Here the perturbation effects are seen from a slightly different point of view. Kinematics description is adapted to the perturbed field by using an approach originally suggested by Broglio [1   T h e  m a in  in te r e s t o f  th is  a p p r o a c h   which deals with a series expansion is to allow for a gradual, hierarchical introduction of the effects. In this paper 


 2 the model is applied for the first time to co-operating spacecraft and differences in orbital parameters are taken into account This model directly written as a differential dynamics, is included in the estimator, and deemed to be the easier-to-fit expected scheme for data analysis Sections 2 and 3 better detail such an approach. Section 4 deals instead with the selected estimator, i.e. the Unscented Kalman Filter 2   w h ic h  m a tc h e s  th e  p r o p o s e d  a p p r o a c h  q u ite  w e ll  I n  fact due to the minimum changes it requires when a different dynamics applies, it allows for an easy allocation of the proposed dynamics model and in perspective for the easy inclusion of additional terms of the series expansion  The availability of a differential model including p erturbation offers, as an additional advantage, the chance to better investigate the characteristics of a specific set of formation configurations recently identified in a numerical approach 3   T h e s e  c o n f ig u r a tio n s   a v a ila b le  f o r  a  s e t o f  orbital parameters and labeled as 223special\224 or 223magic\224 allow for quasi-periodic relative motion between spacecraft even if the J2 effect of the Earth oblateness is considered Therefore, if selected as reference trajectory for a formation they should be able to provide significant advantages in control effort and propellant consumption 4   P a r tia l explanations of their existence have been recently made available \([5    6    b u t it is  e x p e c te d  th a t a d d itio n a l a n a ly s is  should be useful at least to offer different comprehension paths Section 5 is dedicated to this problem faced by means of a series expansion in the parameters\222 differences approach  2  T HE A PPROACH A RCHITECTURE  The rationale of the approach proposed is that measurements p erformed will be, in the specific case of formation ground tracking affected by noise and above all significantly limited in number. In order to obtain an accurate solution as fast as possible the role of the dynamic process embedded in the filter is therefore fundamental. On the other hand, due to the fact that the process is primarily intended to be exploited at the ground segment, computation resources are not a rigid constraint  The proposed solution 226 sketched in Figure 1 226 deals first with an elaborate but potentially very accurate modeling of the dynamics introduced in the next section Due to the range of altitudes of interest, the perturbing effect is limited to the J2 oblateness but there is a possibility of extending the approach to other perturbations. Such a model is the one included in the estimator, which is purposely maintained as open as possible to model changes in order to possibly insert other or higher orders of the already considered perturbing effects in the model adopted. The estimation tool is a recursive filter, in order to provide a timely solution, as opposed to large batch filters often used at the ground segment  Moreover typical ground-based filters enrich their state vector with tuning parameters related to the disturbances instead the proposed approach focuses on dynamics modeling It could be better stated that while orbit determination usually concerns the perturbation model structure as an example by introducing in the filter state some parameter related to their magnitude in the present case attention goes only to the magnitude of \(possibly a set of a priori  selected perturbation\(s assumed as the more appropriate; the structure and dependency on the parameters of these perturbative effects is already given for granted The benefits and drawbacks of the approach will be estimated with reference to different possible types and accuracies of the observables                       Figure 1- A sketch of the approach. The difference from the typical solution is in the 223Theory\224 block where a powerful model for kinematic variables\222 behavior depending on the perturbation acting is introduced  3  D YNAMICS M ODEL  Due to the magnitude of perturbations the dynamics of a s pacecraft formation in Low Earth Orbit LEO is not well represented by simple Keplerian dynamics Among the perturbing effects, the most noticeable are the air drag at the lowest altitudes and the effects of the asphericity of the Earth across all LEO range. In detail, due to the possibility of expanding the Earth potential in a harmonic series, and to hierarchically order these harmonics it is possible to state that in the latter the J2 term is largely dominant In the following only this term will be considered, and the orbital altitude of interest will be located in the higher LEO belt, i.e above 500 km, so that air drag effects could be neglected Independent measurement for each S/C Differential measurements Filter working on the accurate differential dynamics models  Theory to define accurate models for the perturbed behavior Solutions

Moreover, due to the closed form, it easily allows for writing the differences between the position of two or among more than two spacecraft flying in formation Therefore these equations represent a suitable candidate for the dynamics to be introduced in the filter for estimating the formation behavior 4  UKF  E STIMATOR  The selection of the Unscented Kalman Filter \(UKF\, among the several possible estimators, has been in the present case mainly a matter of operational advantages. In fact, the UKF algorithm does not require the evaluation of the Jacobian of the dynamics model as is the case of the traditional Kalman algorithm On the other hand the basic drawback of the Kalman UKF i.e the computation time evaluated 1 order of magnitude larger than EKF on similar problems is of little relevance in the present case as the tracking is performed by the ground segment, and therefore with fewer constraints about hardware

In such a frame, the dynamics model proposed in the previous sections can help in investigating such an interesting problem   Figure 6 226 The plot \(from Ref.

The application of this approach to the analysis of formation flying in higher LEO is proposed. Specifically the resulting dynamics model is considered as the process to be included in an Unscented Kalman Filter for the orbit determination. It is deemed that such a filter, working on an accurate model can allow for better and faster estimation even if working with a reduced amount of observed data, a condition which is likely to be encountered when tracking formations from a limited ground station network The estimator is well suited to ground based orbital determination, as it is allows for the augmented computation effort required by a UKF The same approach could be applied to provide an understanding of the special inclination problem i.e the case of recently discovered quasi-periodic relative motion existing under J2 perturbation

 9   These parameters were calculated using the relations  Analysis of Model A and B  Since both models A and B had same wave deflection angle the analysis gave similar results  For M 1 1.73, ratio of specific heats 1.4 and 12 degrees the ratio of pressure after and before the shock was calculated to be 1.920  The Mach number after the shock was found to be 1.25, it shows that it is still in supersonic regime and therefore the oblique shock formed is a weak oblique shock  Wave angle is also given by the sum of the Mach angle  and small angular difference Therefore      Here is given by the relation   1 1 2 4 \(M 1 2 226 1    That is, for a finite deflection angle the direction of weak oblique shock wave differs from the Mach wave direction  by an amount which is of the same order as   The Mach wave direction was calculated as 35 degrees and was calculated to be around 12 degrees. Sum of these two parameters gave the wave angle to be 40 degrees This is in good accordance with the experimental analysis of Models A and B, which is about 50 degrees  Pressure and temperature before and after the shocks were calculated from the isentropic relationships as the flow was assumed to be isentropic. The following values were determined  P1 = 0.197 bar = 19.7kPa P2 = 0.38 bar = 38kPa  T1 = 187.8 K T2 = 228.6 K  Analysis of Model C  Detached shock was observed near the nose of Model C This shock resulted as the wall deflection angle was greater than max Model C had was designed to have a blunt nose. In such a case, the shock wave remains detached at all supersonic Mach numbers. The flow immediately behind the shock was subsonic. It was difficult to determine the sonic line  The analysis of the flow fiel d associated with detached shock becomes very difficult because of transonic flow which prevails behind the shock. In such a case, the shape of the shock was observed and the detachment distance was determined. It becomes co mplicated to measure the properties in such rarefied flows. Hence the following parameters were found  The detachment distance was found to be 0.3cm from the nose of the model and the shape of the detached shock resembled conventional detached shock wave. However oblique shocks were noticed towards the downstream flow over the model as marked in the picture. The strength of the detached shock waves weakens with the formation of the oblique shock and further weakens until it becomes a Mach line, far away from the object. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of rectangular windows the entire section of the model could not be studied  6. F LUENT S OFTWARE A NALYSIS   Fluent is a general purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. Fluent technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. Th is software was chosen to compute, analyze and model the flow conditions in and around moving models  The wind tunnel models were modeled in Gambit software package and two dimensional analyses was done. Two dimensional analyses were to simplify the complexities arising from turbulent flow model analysis. The top and side views of the models were meshed using Gambit and were exported to Fluent to model the flow conditions  The 2ddp version in Fluent was used. The flow was modeled using density based solver, k-epsilon viscous model was used and properties of air were assumed to be constant. The analysis was done for normal supersonic cruising conditions at 50000 ft at a pressure of 12000 Pa and temperature 216 K. The Mach number was set to about 1.8 for analyzing Model A and B and sonic Mach number for Model C  Analysis of Model B  The top and sectional side views of the model were plotted and meshed using Gambit mesh solver. The mesh was imported in Fluent and the operating conditions were set as stated in the previous paragraphs. The analysis gave contours of pressure, temperat ure, velocity, Mach number and turbulence      
 


 10    The above contour shows static pressure distribution across the model. It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
