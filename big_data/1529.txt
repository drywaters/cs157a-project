tracking devices to visual-based computer application One of the interest 002elds is by using hand gestures to interact with computer However the complexity of a hand set a lot of challenges to be tracked In real-time the application requires high accurate detection and recognition In additional the real and clutter environments have a big impact on recognition process because it included with irrelevant information from the application point of view In this paper a real time vision based hand gesture interaction prototype was proposed Currently a prototype has built for controlling the desktop cursor and concerned the tasks involving in navigation the 
desktop cursor by using hand gesture input modality Keywords human-computer interaction computer vision hand gesture recognition I I NTRODUCTION Human-computer interaction HCI can be described as an interaction between user exchanges of information with computer system F or years human-computer interaction was mostly based on mouse and keyboard to control the computer The human-computer interaction research and development was therefore becoming an interest by many researchers in this recent year There are several techniques introduced for the new Era of human-computer interaction 
such as face detection speech recognition and motion gesture As an example in mixed reality MR it opens a new direction for human-computer interaction which combined with computer vision techniques and it is possible to build an advanced input devices The computer vision devices can be implemented and upgrade to the new input devices in the future It gives the input command to the computer rather than just a function of taking photo or record video We can do more implementation to transform the computer vision devices to become an input command device to reach the function as keyboard or mouse One of the ways to give signal to 
computer vision devices is by using hand gesture More speci\002cally hand gesture is used as the signal or input modality to the computer Certain signal can be recognized by computer as an input of what computer should do These will bene\002ts the entire user without using a direct device and can do what they want as long as the computer vision device can sense it These make computer user easier than using the keyboard or mouse The future computer or laptop may eliminate the use of keyboard and mouse by substituting with a vision-based interpretation devices Human communication comes in many modalities including speech gestures facial and body expressions 
One of the interest 002elds is by using hand gestures to interact with computer as a non-contact human computer input modality In the human-computer interaction literature gesture has been used to determine various types of human hand movements for controlling of computer processes The hand gesture interaction with computer is an interesting part in the study of human-computer interaction In particular visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for human-computer interaction Nowadays there are several obstacles for achieving robust and ef\002cient hand gestures detection methods in the real time environment The complexity of a hand set a lot 
of challenges to be tracked and interpreted The fact that the different gestures complexity such as variability and 003exibility of articulated hand structure shape of gestures real-time performance varying illumination conditions and complex background noise In real-time the application requires high accurate detection and recognition In additional the real and clutter environments have a big impact on recognition process because it included with irrelevant information from the application point of view Besides this hand gesture can help in convey the message to the other For example sign language is a set of gestures which was one of the most natural ways of exchanging 
information for most deaf people This research aim is to develop a prototype using vision-based hand gesture interaction with computer In our research we are proposing a more effective and friendly methods for intelligent humancomputer interaction by using hand gestures The hand gestures are used to simulate and control the movement of the desktop cursor by replacing the function of the mouse The challenge for this research is the complexity of the hand and the dif\002culty in detection and recognition process In real time the prototype requires a high accuracy in detection and recognition Noisy encountered in the environment may have

a big impact on the detection and recognition performance of the hand gesture The prototype is utilized a low cost computer camera as input tool to capture the video frame followed by the process of video frame in the real time II L ITERATURE R EVIEW The early technology of hand gesture detector used mechanical device to retrieve the information of the hand gesture One of the e xample included data glo v e de vices 4  which user send the information to the computer system through the movement of 002ngers Data glove is quite popular at the several years ago however the development of the computer hardware improved a lot in this recent decade make the hardware cheaper and offers a better performance in computing The vision-based hand gesture slowly replaces the role of data glove with non wearable devices because it is more naturalness without using any devices in the hand and user friendly which is important in human-computer interaction Compared with data glove it look cumbersome and limitation in the movement of hand Because vision is one of the six physical media that computer must be instantiated perceptibly when communicated to humans Hence vision-based approach is more than wearable devices in hand gesture recognition Normally most of the gesture recognition systems divided into three stages which are image pre-processing follow by tracking and 002nally recognition stage as sho wn in Figure 1 Figure 1 Three common stages of gesture recognition systems In tracking there are several researchers who have done the similar research like Viola-Jones based cascade classi\002er commonly used for face tracking in rapidly image processing 7 Cascade classi\002ers are currently considered more robust pattern detection against the noises and lighting conditions as well These methods also pro v ed by man y researchers that not only used to tracking for faces but also in recognize hand or other part of human body 9 10 11 12 Other e xisting application lik ed HandV u by K olsch and Turk 10 which is the impro v ement from the V iola and Jones research 7 and can be used to recognize six types of hand gesture A snapshot of the HandVu application is shown in Figure 2 the 002gure shown the two difference type of gesture recogntion in HandVu a First type of HandVu b Second type of HandVu Figure 2 Snapshot of HandVu application Apart from this Marcel and his colleagues proposed a new type of hand gesture recognition method based on Input-Output Hidden Markov Models by tracking the skincolor blobs of the human body to reach the goal of recognition of two classes of gesture Chen and colleagues  applied hidden Mark o v model method in training the hand gesture to recognition the hand postures However the hidden Markov model is more complex in training the hand gesture compared with Cascade classi\002ers Recent works by many researchers have shown that hand gesture system is not just technical and theoretical but also practical implement into several type of application systems and various environment For example Ahn et al designed a new interactive way for the slide show presentation system in the virtual environment sho w on the screen Jain proposed a vision-based hand gesture pose estimation for mobile devices with single pointing gestures The other example is the sign language tutoring tool studied by Aran et al which their research designed to teaching the fundamental of the sign language in interactive way

III M ETHODOLOGY A Hand Gesture Training The proposed real-time vision-based hand gesture recognition is using a cascade of boosted classi\002ers based on the Haar-like feature 8 9 This approach pro vides a rob ust and cheap computing in pattern recognition in nearly the real time The originally of the approach is proposed by Viola and Jones 7 to recognize f ace and the algorithm also suitable used for hand gesture recognition Before training 002rst a set of suitable hand postures need to be chooses in case to make the computing smooth while training and help to reduce the error rate and also reduce the confusion when detecting hand gestures of the prototype In the multimodal interface hand gestures can be combined with other input modality like speech in a variant environment This research will simulate the movement of desktop cursor hence a 002st or close hand has been selected to simulate and replace the movement of desktop cursor because it has the less confusion cause and palm or open hand to simulate no movement for the desktop cursor as shown in Figure 3 a Open hand/palm b Close hand/\002st Figure 3 Selected hand posture for training a Open hand or palm posture is selected for one of the selected hand posture b Close hand or 002st is chosen as the second selected hand posture During training a collection of 200 positive samples images for each posture and 400 negative samples images used to train with the classi\002er The training process is using Haar Training system of OpenCV library The outcome of the training adapted to implement into the algorithm of prototype to recognize the hand gestures after the test samples successfully The 003ow for the process of Haar training is shown as Figure 4 B Hand Recognition Unlike most of the researcher they using hand contour  and skin color detector to do the se gmentation and track the positioning for the coordinate of hand gesture 20 23 24 Ho we v er  one of the major dif ferent in this research is tracking and recognition happens in simultaneously This approach is quite similar to the Kolch and Turk which their work can recognize six hand posture Belo w is the short description for the process of recognition of hand gesture Figure 4 Process of Haar training 017 Step 1 Put the hand at inside the ranges of the camera angle view 017 Step 2 When the hand is in open palm like Figure 3 a which meaning the recognizer freeze and when the hand is in 002st like Figure 3 b the recognizer will recognize as meaningful input command to the prototype 017 Step 3 The prototype will integrate with the computer application and start simulate in the posture of the 002st until the hand shape change C Process Flow of Integration The 003ow of the integration process is explained from starting the prototype until the end of the prototype execution 017 Step 1 Start the prototype and initializes the computer camera to capture the video for the real-time 017 Step 2 Move the hand inside the ranges of the camera view the recognizer will process by processing the image frame whether it is the selected hand gesture 017 Step 3 If it is the selected hand gesture the recognizer will select the closest selected hand gesture 017 Step 4 The prototype will simulate the movement of the desktop cursor by using the correct hand gesture 017 Step 5 The simulation end up when the selected hand gesture not longer in the camera view In the condition when more than single selected hand gesture the nearest detected hand gesture will be the input modality The other hand gesture will be ignore by the prototype This is to prevent the confusing of the prototype when processed the hand gesture The 003ow of the process diagram is shown in Figure 5 IV F INDINGS An experiment is undertaken to test the functionality of the prototype The prototype is testing at indoor environment because of the lighting and illuminate condition in a room is optimized for the recognizer Figure 6 a shows the experiment environment for testing the vision-based hand gesture recognition in the real time Figure 6 b shows a selected hand gesture captured by the camera in the free condition or open hand posture In this gesture the recognizer will detect as no activity or event for the desktop

Figure 5 The Prototype Process Diagram cursor Figure 6 c shows a red square boundary was draw when the selected hand gesture in the 002st posture is captures under the camera view in the display to show that the hand gesture is been detected as a selected hand gesture with activity condition The experiment is successful as it reaches the target of interactions with the desktop cursor by using computer vision method computer camera with hand gesture as the input modality in a real-time The movements of the desktop cursor move in the smooth condition The hand gesture does not confuse the recognizer in the static backgrounds and in suitable environment V C ONCLUSION In this paper we proposed an alternative method to replace the traditional way that human interact with computer The prototype basically meet the objective of this project that is design and develop a prototype that enable user to use vision-based hand gesture to open an application of the computer desktop There are many researchers doing their research about vision-based hand gesture and recognition but it is quite messy because there are no such general approaches that can be a standard for vision-based hand gesture interaction The hand gesture interaction can serves as improving the interaction between human and computer The evolution of computer technology have reached that human can interact with computer by using non-verbal language Therefore there is needed for a robust and ef\002cient approach for the vision-based hand gesture recognition that can work well in a real-time environment This paper implements this new knowledge which can be a guideline to other researchers by using computer vision technology This technology should popularize because it is believed that a An experiment lab b A palm or open hand c A 002st or closed hand Figure 6 The open testing of vision-based hand gesture in a real-time environment a The indoor experiment lab with less clutter background b The hand with open postures with no activity c The 002st been detected as trigger an activity of the computer the future environment will be full of computer vision hand gesture in controlling the machine VI F UTURE W ORK The current prototype is shown to work fairly well for hand gesture recognition in the real-time However there are a few efforts that can be undertaken to enhance the prototype Current prototype only supports single hand in gesture interaction Hence multiple hands gesture interaction can be proposed In the mean time multiple hands increase the computational costs and complexity of the system A robust approach is necessary to reduce this problem and complexity of hand gesture recognition In the future suggestion an evaluation testing on the prototype will be carried on by

several groups of users Their responses feedback and observations toward their experience when testing with the prototype will be recorded during the evaluation testing Beside this we will be focusing more on the improvement of the vision-based hand gesture recognition In order to increase the accuracy rate user satisfactions and reduce the error rate more hand posture will be selected to support the activity that can be done on the desktop For our future work we will propose a multi modal human-computer interaction system by integrating speech recognition together with the vision-based hand gesture interaction By enhancing speech recognition into the system the obtained result is predicted to be better comparing to only a single input modality A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Ghazali Sulong Dzulki\003i Mohamad and Mohd Shahrizal Sunar for their helpful comments R EFERENCES  D Tzo v aras Multimodal User Interfaces From Signals to Interaction  Springer Heidelberg 2008  N A Ismail and A O'Brien Enabling Multimodal Interaction in Web-Based Personal Digital Photo Browsing Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering 2008 Kuala Lumpur Malaysia May 13-15 2008 pp 907-910  P  K ortum HCI Beyond the GUI Design for Haptic Speech Olfactory and Other Nontraditional Interfaces  Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 2008 pp 75-106  J W eissmann and R Salomon Gesture Recognition for Virtual Reality Applications Using Data Gloves and Neural Networks IJCNN 99 International Conference On Neural Networks Vol 3 1999 pp 2043-2046  T  G Zimmerman J Lanier  C Blanchard S Bryson and Y  Harvill A Hand Gesture Interface Device CHl+GI 1987 pp 189-192  T  B Moeslund and L Nor g aard  A brief o v ervie w of hand gestures used in wearable human computer interfaces Technical report Aalborg University Denmark 2002  P  V iola and M  Jones Rob ust Real-time Object Detection  2nd International Workshop on Statistical and Computerational Theories of Vision July 2001  P  V iola and M Jones Rapid Object Detection Using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Feature IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Vol 1 Dec 2001 pp 551-518  Q Chen M D Cordea E M Petriu A R V ark on yiKoczy and T E Whalen Human-Computer Interaction for Smart Environment Applications Using Hand-Gesture and Facial-Expressions International Journal of Advanced Media and Communication vol 3 n.1/2 June 2009 pp 95-109 doi:10.1504/IJAMC.2009.026854  M K olsc h and M T urk Rob ust Hand Detection  In International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2004  M K olsch and M T urk  Anaysis of Rotational Rob ustness of Hand Detection with a Viola-Jones Detector In IAPR International Conference of Pattern Recognition 2004  Q Zhang F  Chen and X Liu Hand Gesture Detection and Segmentation Based on Difference Background Image with Complex Background The 2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems ICESS 08 2008 pp 338343  L Anton-Canalis E Sanchez-Nielsen and M CastrillonSantana Hand Pose Detection for Vision-based Gesture Interfaces Conference on Machine Vision Applications Tsukuba Science City Japan May 16-18 2005  S Marcel O Bernier  J E V iallet and D Collobert Hand Gesture Recognition using Input-Output Hidden Markov Models Proc of the FG'2000 Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2000  F  Chen C Fu and C Huang Hand gesture recognition using a real-time tracking method and hidden Markov models Image and Vision Computing 2003 pp 745-758  S C Ahn T  S Lee I J Kim Y  M Kw on and H G Kim Computer Vision-Based Interactive Presentation System Proceedings of Asian Conference for Computer Vision 2004 January 2004  G Jain V ision-Based Hand Gesture Pose Estimation for Mobile Devices University of Toronto 2009  O Aran I Ari F  Benoit A Campr  A.H Carrillo P  F anard L Akarun A Caplier M Rombaut and B Sankur Sign Language Tutoring Tool eNTERFACE 2006 The Summer Workshop on Multimodal Interfaces Croatia 2006  Q Chen N D Geor g anas E M Petriu Real T ime visionbased Hand Gesture Recognition using Haar-like features IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement 2007  F  Chen Designing Human Interface In Speech Technology  Springer 2005 pp 251-288  G Bradski and A Kaehler  Learning OpenCV Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library  O'Reilly Media Inc 2008  A A Ar gyros and M I A Lourakis V ision-Based Inter pretation on Hand Gestures for Remote Control of a Computer Mouse In Computer Vision in Human-Computer Interaction 2006 pp 40-51  J Zaletelj J Perha vc and J F  T asic V ision-based humancomputer interface using hand gestures 8th International Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services 2007  J W en a nd Y  Zhan V ision-Based T w o Hand Detection and Tracking In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Interaction Sciences Information Technology Culture and Human Seoul Korea 2009 pp 1253-1258

manufacturer value is 249 ns. Our measurements give two zones, depending on whether the local or remote memory are accessed. Indeed, the average access time in the interleaving zone is the average of combining accesses to the local or remote memory. Our outcomes gave an average value of 278,3 ns We can conclude that, when working with codes mapped to cores in a same cell \(especially for those who demand a high level of cache replacement allocated in the same cell  s memory. The access to remote memory becomes very costly, so if cores in both cells must be used, the allocation of the data in the interleaving memory makes sense V. INFLUENCE OF THREAD ALLOCATION ON IRREGULAR CODES A. Ported Technique The next step consisted of porting a parallelisation technique for irregular codes to our target architecture, in order a b c Figure 4.

The chosen technique was IARD [12] \(Irregular Access Region Descriptor characterise irregular codes at run-time which exploits the properties found in the access patterns, expressing them with a structure that allows a strong reduction in storage requirements without loss of relevant information. The lowcost, compact characterisation of the subscript arrays can be used to perform an efficient parallelisation of a wide set of irregular codes In order to test the efficiency of this technique, two well known benchmarks \(Sparse matrix-Dense vector Product and Irregular Reduction parallelised using OpenMP. The pseudocodes are shown in Table III. In both cases, some selected sparse matrices stored in CSC format from the Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix Collection [13], which had previously been reordered using this technique, were used as an input. The key features of these matrices are shown in Table IV The compiler used for the experiments was Intel ifort 9.1.052. The baseline compile configuration used in all our tests involved the -O3 option and the interprocedural optimisation \(-ipo B. Influence of Bus Contention To study the influence of the bus contention several scenarios were tested. On the one hand, an intra-cell scenario where the data are allocated in a single cell  s memory and the cores involved belong to the same cell. On the other hand, an inter-cell scenario where the data are fetched from the other cell  s memory and there are cores involved from both cells. Before presenting the results, it is necessary to 


both cells. Before presenting the results, it is necessary to clarify the meaning of a so-called thread distribution. For example, a distribution 15-11-13-9 means that for a onethread execution, the thread will be allocated in Core 15. For Table IV SQUARED-MATRIX INPUT SET USED IN OUR TESTS.

In the cases where more cores are used and the distribution is not pointed out, it means that the order in which the remaining available cores are assigned is not relevant 1 library was used to allocate all data in the Cell 0 memory and only cores in this cell were used. Several scenarios were set up to study the effect of running the Irregular Reduction and SpMV benchmarks with different distributions, in order to quantify the effect of the bus sharing 15-11-13-9 vs 15-14-13-12: This scenario is focused on 2 and 4 cores. In both benchmarks the sparse matrix must be completely read, which is expected to cause some number of capacity and compulsory cache misses. Therefore, the bigger the matrix, the higher the traffic in the bus, so a performance decrease is expected for the biggest matrices when sharing the bus. At the sight of the results \(Table V a better behaviour of the distribution 15-11-13-9 can be appreciated \(differences over 6% are highlighted biggest matrices \(3dtube, nasasrb and s3dkq4m2 four-core case. Indeed, it was confirmed that the bigger the matrix, the higher the traffic in the bus and the higher the improvement when there are only two threads per bus \(15-11 and 13-9 15-14-1312 can be observed, the traffic is not high enough to be relevant It is noticeable that the most important improvements occur only in the SpMV benchmark, especially for four processors This behaviour happens because SpMV executes a loop which goes through five different arrays, whereas Irregular Reduction goes only through two. So in the former case the cache reuse is smaller than in the latter one. At any given moment, therefore, the SpMV benchmark generates more traffic in the bus than the Irregular Reduction one 15-11-13-9 vs 15-14-11-10: This scenario is focused on 4 cores. The outcomes in Table VI show that there are no noticeable differences between the case when the threads are 151 Table VI PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT \(% MFLOPS DISTRIBUTION 15-14-11-10 OVER 15-11-13-9 FOR Nc = 4 CORES DATA ARE ALLOCATED IN CELL 0 MEMORY Matrix Nc

We know that IARD has no dependencies among the cores involved. Since the outcomes show almost no differences between threads mapped to different cores in different sockets and threads sharing the same socket, we can confirm, then, the conclusion of Section IV-A, which stated that each core behaves as an independent processor regardless of the sockets they are placed in 2 fetching data from a memory module in other cell was studied. Moreover, a comparison was carried out between the automatic thread assignment the system does and our manual assignments. To do that, libnuma was used through its command line tool numactl, in order to allocate all the data in the cell we were working in \(memory 0 memory \(memory 1 memory 2 We intended to infer from these experiments whether the default system behaviour is reliable or, on the contrary another memory allocation policy should be used 15-11-13-9 vs system-assigned: We used the Perfmon2 library to check the system  s default policy to assign threads to cores. This scenario compares a manual allocation with the default one done by the system. We found out that the system assigns the threads without a defined policy changing it in every execution, although it strives to place the threads in separate cells as far as it is possible. Therefore after discarding outliers, we present a range of results inside the standard deviation instead of a single average value. The outcomes in Table VII show a dramatic improvement with our distribution, especially for the biggest matrices \(3dtube nasasrb and s3dkq4m2 cell scenario, there was no distribution that showed such a big difference in the performance, which indeed suggests that the system does not maximise locality Threads spread over both cells: Our second test intended to find out whether the system assignment spreads the threads over two cells, even if there are available cores in the same cell. So the automatic assignment was compared to a manual distribution where the number of involved threads is kept balanced between both cells. The threads were distributed to cores 15-7 for two threads, 15-7-11-3 for four and 15-7-11-3-13-5-9-1 for eight.

Influence of Cache Coherency Taking into account that this kind of irregular codes strives to maximise the thread locality, we do not expect to notice important performance decreases due to the cache coherency protocols when the input matrices are big enough, since they will be masked by the traffic in the bus. If the matrices fit in each core  s cache, all misses, except the capacity ones, will be solved by the snooping protocol inside the bus, faster than 152 asking the directory. However, this will not usually be the case in real applications, because this type of codes usually operates with matrices far bigger than the cache size VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented the results of several tests carried out to characterise FINISTERRAE, an SMP-NUMA machine, in order to study the suitability of applying strategies to parallelise irregular codes initially developed for SMP systems The main factors considered were the thread-to-core distribution and the memory allocation. Firstly, a benchmark was executed to test the performance influence of several cores when sharing a bus and allocating the data in local or remote memory. Secondly, another benchmark was used to evaluate the influence of the cache coherency between two cores when sharing data. Furthermore, another test evaluated the memory access latency depending on the memory module allocated \(local, remote or interleaving At the sight of the results, we can claim that, especially for applications which use the bus intensively, the effect of sharing a bus between two or more cores degrades the performance and should be avoided by spreading the threads among cores in different buses when possible. We must take into account, though, that the test to evaluate the local and remote memory access latencies yielded important differences between them. Therefore, in cases where the threads must be spread in two cells the best policy will be to analyse and split the data in both memory zones, maximising the locality or, when not possible, allocating the data in the interleaving zone Regarding the cache coherency, the effects in the performance are noticeable when dealing with small sizes of data which fit into caches. The more the memory size increases the less significant the effect is. Therefore, for small data sizes, it would be advisable to map the threads on cores in the same bus. For bigger data sizes, the effect of sharing a bus will be more important and it will mask the effect of cache coherency. A noteworthy fact is that every core in the same processor behaves as an independent processor, so we can consider two processors in a bus as four independent 


can consider two processors in a bus as four independent cores After the benchmarking stage, an actual strategy to parallelise irregular codes, successfully tested on SMP architectures, was ported to FINISTERRAE. A set of matrices was chosen and reordered with this strategy, being applied subsequently to the sparse matrix-vector product and the Irregular Reduction benchmarks. Since this code works with sparse data, the effects regarding bus sharing were not as noticeable as in the previous stage. However, it was possible to confirm the importance of spreading the threads among cores in different buses when dealing with big data sizes the behaviour of each core as an independent processor, and the fact that the coherency effects are masked by the bus sharing when increasing the data size As a future work, we intend to develop strategies to guide applications at run-time in the frame of our project, so the conclusions presented here will help to define a thread-tocore mapping and memory allocation policies ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the MCyT of Spain through the TIN2007-67537-C03-01 project and by the 2008/CE377 contract among HP, CESGA, UDC and USC REFERENCES 1] L.

also be used to define constraints for service selection At run-time, the workflow engine for XML nets interprets and evaluates Filter Schemas and transition inscriptions to filter and create Web service descriptions as XML documents. With process monitoring and administration tools which are usual components of workflow management systems, new criterions and constraints for WS discovery and selection can be incorporated at run-time by reconfiguring transition inscription statements and variable instantiations in Filter Schemas  Instantiating abstract WS transition Figure 4 shows a fragment of the abstract WSC process in Section 5.1 to demonstrate the ability of XML nets in WS discovery. To obtain transport information, Web services whose descriptions are stored in an unknown WSDL repository should be discovered The token count of the place representing the repository is supposed to be unlimited. The abstract transitions find transport info service? and ?get transport information? are used to bind and call Web services at runtime. The incoming arc of the transition ?find transport info service? is a reading connection \(represented by a dashed arc nipulative Filter Schema FS2 used to create Web service descriptions is assigned to the outgoing arc of this transition. FS1 and FS2 are both generated according to WSDL Schema  Adapting abstract WS transition at run-time Suppose that the transition ?get transport information? is used to acquire flight information. Variables in FS1 should be \(partly  3 http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl#A4.1 4 http://uddi.org/schema/uddi_v3.xsd es supplying flight information. As shown in Figure 5a the variable of the attribute filter ?name? of the element filter ?service? is instantiated with a regular expression for filtering Web services whose name contains the string ?flight?. This regular expression, together with the Filter Schema, is parsed to XQuery/XPath statements in process simulation or execution. If we use a reconfiguration tool to modify the regular expression at run-time as shown for example in Figure 5b, the transition ?get transport information? can then be adapted to acquire other transport information, e.g., train information. After a suitable WSDL document has been found, FS2 is used to create a new WSDL document for the place ?WS description by cloning the discovered document. Figure 5c shows the diagram of FS2 containing the WSDL root element definitions? and an element placeholder, which is used because the internal structure and details of the document to be created are not of interest in the case of document duplication  QoS-aware WS selection XML nets can also be used to select desired Web services if service constraints like QoS or customized preferences are taken into consideration. As WSDL and OWL-S provide no or limited ways for describing Web service?s QoS, we use in this paper OWL-QoS 43], which complements OWL-S with an ontology to specify QoS metrics for Web services, to demonstrate the ability of XML nets for \(QoS-aware Naturally, other Web service ontologies \(e.g., MOQ 11 e.g., WSLA [18 can also be used for this purpose Figure 6 shows another XML net fragment for the acquisition of transport information by selecting OWL 


acquisition of transport information by selecting OWLQoS documents which describe quality of Web services from a repository that contains 3 OWL-QoS documents discovered previously. Similar to the example in Figure 2, the Filter Schema FS1 is used to read and select appropriate OWL-QoS documents, and the Filter Schema FS2 to create new OWL-QoS documents for the place ?OWL-QoS document?. As Filter Schema provides no means for formulating inequality operators like ?&gt;? and ?&lt;=?, which are usually used to express constraints with parameters whose quantitative values are limited to a certain interval, transition inscriptions Figure 4.

Filter Schemas for Web service discovery definitions 1 service name: \\s*flight\\s*/i c definitions service name: \\s*train\\s*/i b a definitions 1 1 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 can be used in combination with Filter Schemas to formulate QoS constrains Suppose that the traveler wants to use only the Web services that cost no more than 100 US Cent. The Filter Schema FS1 should then be created as shown in Figure 7. The variable of the attribute filter ?rdf: resource? of the element filter ?owl: onProperty? is instantiated with a regular expression to filter OWL-QoS documents specifying the property ?costUSCent?. To ensure that the maximal cost of the Web service doesn?t exceed 100 US cent, the inscription of the transition ?select transport info service? should be formulated as owl:maxCardinality &lt;= 100?. In process simulation or execution, the inscription is parsed and integrated into XQuery statements using XPath inequality operators  6. Conclusions  In this paper we presented a WSC method based on XML nets, which inherit advantages of Petri nets such as formal semantics and graphical expression. XML nets have additional strengths in the description of process and data objects, and the exchange of XMLbased structured data. The advantage of using XML nets for WSC is that control flow modeling, data and data flow modeling, and WS discovery and selection can be realized using a uniform powerful modeling language. Some uncomplicated tasks, as illustrated before, can be fulfilled without developing or using additional software components or agents. Naturally XML nets can also be combined with other Web service techniques to fulfill more complicated and demanding tasks  7.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
