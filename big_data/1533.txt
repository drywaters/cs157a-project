In this paper effect on time dependent boundary conditions on rack inlet temperatures will be discussed in detail with the transient modeling of data centers Case studies will be presented to illustrate the transient fluctuations of rack inlet air temperature by the variation of rack power and CRAC flow rate  KEY WORDS Data Center, Numerical Modeling, Flotherm Transient Analysis, Transient Boundary Conditions  INTRODUCTION The rapid increase in compute power and storage capabilities of servers has inevitably lead to higher power dissipations This introduced a thermal challenge in how to efficiently cool these servers Grouping together these high power dissipating servers into one room results in a high power density data center. It becomes even more challenging here for data center managers when trying to provide adequate cooling in order to operate the servers within an acceptable environment On the other hand when adequate cooling is provided data center managers are confronted with the high levels of energy consumption in order to cool data center facilities A study has shown that 1.5 of the total consumption of electricity in the United States is merely for cooling data center facilities 1   T h is  m a k e s  i t n e c e s s a r y  to  conduct thorough thermal-fluids analyses of data centers  Many approaches are being considered for reducing energy consumption for the cooling of data center facilities such as the use of wet-bulb economizers 1   th e  u s e  o f  e v a p o r a ti v e  cooling [2   a n d  a d a p ti n g  c e r t a in  p r a c tic e s  i n  o p e r a tin g  a  d a ta  center facility 3   I n  a d d itio n   th e  d e v e lo p m e n t o f  e f f ic ie n c y  measures for data center energy efficiency characterization such as power usage effectiveness PUE and data center infrastructure \(DCiE\ [4  a r e  b e c o m in g  i m p o r ta n t   On the other hand computational analyses using specialized CFD software have been used to better understand and design data centers for many years. Specifically over the past decade numerous studies have been presented addressing thermalfluids analyses of data centers 5-11   H o w e v e r   m o s t o f  t h e  analyses conducted in the past have been concerned only with steady state behavior of the data center. Fixed flow rates and rack powers are imposed, and the codes are used to obtain the steady state temperatures of the data center room Various changes can occur in an operating data center such as the rack power or the CRAC supply flow rate or temperature. This in turn changes the dynamics of the data center room and understanding the effect of these changes is of great importance for dynamic cooling In order to address this problem, transient analysis of data centers is required  Very few have addressed the transient analysis of data centers Bash et al motivated to dynamically monitor CRAC with a cascaded control algorithm by using temperature sensor information from the racks 12    B e ite l m a l e t a l  e x p lo r e d  CRAC failure scenario through transient analysis and suggested to distribute rack load accordingly 13   S h a r m a  e t al discussed the use of dynamic thermal management in the reduction of energy consumption of data centers 14   T h is  paper is intended to shed light on the importance of transient analysis of data centers and its differences with steady state analysis The establishment of a transient model and the effects of spatial and time grids on the solution are discussed A study by Ibrahim et al 15  u s e s  t h e  tr a n s ie n t m o d e l established in this paper to further explore different scenarios of varying CRAC airflow and server power and their effects on rack inlet temperatures and airflow dynamics in the room  Fig 1 shows a typical raised floor data center with room return infrastructure. In this type of arrangement, the computer room air conditioner CRAC units push cold air into the plenum from where it is introduced into the computer room via perforated floor tiles The raised floor design offers considerable flexibility in placing the computer equipment above the raised floor The under floor plenum serves as a distribution chamber for the cooling air Without the need of ducting, cooling air can be delivered to any location simply by 


2  replacing a solid floor tile by a perforated tile  The  r egion where perforated tiles are placed is called a cold aisle. On each side of the cold aisle computer racks are placed with their intake sides facing the cold aisle  The cold air is drawn by the computer racks and the hot air is exhausted in the region between back ends of two rows of racks. This region is called hot aisle. Hot air rises from the hot aisle, into the ceiling space and flows back into the CRAC units    Fig 1 A typical raised floor data center with alternating hot and cold aisle arrangement [8   The organization of this paper is as follows: First a numerical modeling section discussing the parameters of the data center room to be studied and the details of the transient model Following that is a section comparing steady state and transient models Then the spatial grid and time grid sensitivities are discussed A case study showing the importance of transient modeling is addressed Finally the paper ends with a summary and conclusions section  NUMERICAL MODELING In this paper CFD code Flotherm V8.2 is used for predicting airflow and heat transfer in data center environments 16   Both steady state and transient modeling approaches have been discussed in this paper. A convergence criterion of 1E-04 was used for all the simulations in this study  Modeling studies were carried out on a representative raisedfloor data center with alternating hot and cold aisle arrangement and room return infrastructure refer to fig 1 The fluid flow and heat transfer equations are solved numerically using the k\001 turbulence model. Buoyancy effects were accounted for using the Boussinesq Approximation Effects of radiation were ignored. Figure 2 shows plan view of data center considered to present the numerical study 8-11   CRAC units are modeled as simple devices which supply cold air to the plenum and extract the hot exhaust from the room at the same specified flow rate The data center has 20 server racks each dissipating power that varies between 16kW and 32kW with a fixed air flow  through each rack of 2000 CFM 0.943 m 3 s The temperature rise across the racks varies b etween 15C and 30C for 16kW and 32kW power respectively. Four CRAC units supply air at 15C to the raised floor plenum To feed cold air to 20 server racks ideally CRAC flow rate has to be 10,000 cfm per CRAC which is equivalent to 5.48 kg/s. A 80% CRAC flow rate is 8,000 cfm which refers to 80 of the ideal CRAC flow rate 0.8 x 10,000 cfm This flow rate is equivalent to 4.38 kg/s The details of the CFD model parameters are given in table 1  Temperature data was recorded at six vertical locations at the center of each rack The monitor points were located in the cold aisle to measure the inlet temperatures into the rack at an offset of 75mm from the rack as per ASHRAE guidelines 17   T h e  lo w e s t m o n ito r  p o in t is  lo c a te d  a t a  h e i g h t  o f  3 3 3 m m  and the highest one at 1750mm, above the raised floor. Since the room is symmetrical, only half of the room is considered to reduce the computational time  With steady state analyses the CRAC is modeled as a fixed flow device that introduces cold air into the room at a fixed temperature and flow rate Similarly server racks they are modeled as sources of constant power The addition of a transient analysis required a few changes to our steady state model by allowing the CRAC airflow rate and the server rack power to vary with time With these changes one can input any profile shape to vary either CRAC air flow rate and/or rack server power with time  The CRAC was modeled using a pressure source with a specified transient profile. To supply the airflow at a specified temperature of 15C a temperature source was coupled with the pressure source. A cutout was created on the CRAC unit to act as sink for the extract air Similarly server racks were modeled as enclosures with sources having specified transient profiles [16

Fig 3 shows the temperature variation of rack A1 with time at 3 height locations We can note from the figure how the increase in power raises the inlet temperatures to as high as 42 o C, which is an unacceptable value according to the ASHRAE data center guidelines. Fig 4 shows a spot on agreement of rack A1 inlet temperatures for the transient model at time equals 50 seconds and the steady state model However steady state model cannot predict the time dependent fluctuations example rack power and CRAC flow rate in a data center. To capture the dynamic behavior of data centers transient numerical modeling approach must be used Hence remainder of this paper will focus on transient studies    Fig 3 Rack inlet temperatures comparison between simple and heat exchanger model for 100% CRAC supply   Fig 4: Variation of inlet temperature with rack A1 height for steady state and transient models  SPATIAL GRID To investigate spatial and time grid sensitivities, one transient profile was adopted in which the CRAC airflow rate was kept constant at 80 supply The server rack power was varied with time following the profile in fig 5 As indicated by the figure, the server rack power is initially at 16kW when it starts to increase linearly for 60 seconds until it reaches 32kW. The server power then decreases linearly for 60 seconds reaching its initial state. This particular shape of the profile was chosen to relate to a sudden fluctuation in server rack power Such fluctuations in either power or airflow are more efficiently analyzed using transient models  Grid sensitivity runs were carried out at different grid sizes to obtain grid independent temperature and flow distributions Figs 6\(a\ and 6\(b\ show rack inlet temperature versus number of grid cells for rack A1 at two monitored height locations of 999mm and 1750mm, respectively. The figures show results at three different times during a transient run The plots show grid independent temperature distributions beyond 200k grid cells The number of grid cells used for all the analyses is 230k    Fig 5: Server rack power profile with time  


4    Fig 6\(a\: Mesh sensitivity analysis for different grid sizes for rack A1 at a height 999mm     Fig 6\(b\: Mesh sensitivity analysis for different grid sizes for rack A1 at a height 1750mm  TIME GRID It is necessary in a transient analysis to conduct a time step sensitivity analysis to obtain time step independent temperatures and flow distributions. Figs 7\(a\ is a plot of inlet temperature vs time for rack D1 monitored at a height of 1750mm above the raised floor for computational runs using six different time steps Similarly fig 7\(b is a plot of inlet temperature vs. time for rack A1 monitored at a height 333mm above the raised floor. The designations 1 step to 6 step refer to the number of seconds corresponding to a time step \(i.e., 1 step corresponds to a transient run with a time step of 1 second; 2 step refers to a time step of 2 seconds, etc\.  One can see from both figures that as the time step gets larger the temperature values tend to deviate from the 1 second time step results where the temperature values are varying rapidly. It is desirable to use larger time steps for a transient analysis as it cuts down the computational time significantly. However, that should not be on the cost of inaccurate results  It can be seen from both figures figs 7\(a and 7\(b that the inlet temperatures are continuously varying with time This indicates that a steady state analysis will not be a suitable tool in analyzing such a behavior in a data center. One can assume to conduct a steady state analysis at 80% supply and a server rack power of 32 kW to represent the peak of the fluctuation at time equals 60 seconds. However, this is inaccurate as steady state is not reached at that time  I    Fig 7\(a\: Time step sensitivity analysis for rack D1 monitored at a height of 1750mm above the raised floor    Fig 7\(b\: Time step sensitivity analysis for rack A1 monitored at a height of 333mm above the raised floor   CASE STUDY  CRAC FAILURE To demonstrate the importance of transient analysis, one case study on CRAC failure is presented Initially the data center facility is at 15C with a 100 CRAC supply when a server rack power of 32 kW is introduced At time equals 150 seconds, CRAC 1 fails and instantly shuts down. Fig. 8 below shows the location of the failed CRAC  With this failure, the total supply comes down to 75% of the total server rack power Figs 9\(a and 9\(b show the inlet temperature variation with time at three different height locations for racks A1 and D1, respectively. Fig 9\(a\ shows an overshoot of inlet temperature beyond the final steady state value for heights of 1332 mm and 1750 mm Obviously a steady state run is not capable of capturing such an overshoot in temperature. It is important for data center managers to be aware of such variations within the data center room to efficiently operate a data center facility Such variations are 


5  only captured by transient analysis. Fig 9\(b\ shows a dip down in temperature before it goes back up and reaches steady state This is only one simple case out of an infinite number of scenarios that can take place in a data center facility, some of which may present more extreme variations. A more detailed study on different data center scenarios can be found in [15              oo۽1111            ""aaųǼqqqKKK     LL3?66&}}HH22SS+:?*@@!!!!II/=7

Two scenarios \(i\ Time dependent power variation and ii Time dependent flow variations have been presented A pyramid shaped transient profile for varying power is used to establish a spatial and time grid independent temperature and flow distributions It was shown that using a larger step reduces computational time however may obtain inaccurate results. A comparison was made between the transient model and the steady state model which showed accuracy of the transient model One case study was presented in which a CRAC failed. The study showed the importance of a transient model in showing temperature overshoots which a steady state model is not capable of showing  REFERENCES 1  M ik e  C   a n d  W e a v e r  T     D a ta  c e n te r  c o o lin g    u s in g  w e tbulb economizers ASHRAE Journal August 2008 pp 5258  2  J u d g e  J    P o u c h e t J    E k b o te  A    a n d  D ix it S     R e d u c i n g  data center energy consumption ASHRAE Journal November 2008, pp. 14-26  3  M ik e  C    W e a v e r  T    D u n n a v a n t K    a n d  F is h e r  M    Reduce data center cooling cost by 75%, ASHRAE Journal April 2009, pp. 34-41 4  S a li m  M     E n e r g y  in  d a ta  c e n te r s  b e n c h m a r k in g  a n d  lessons learned, ASHRAE Journal, April 2009, pp. 24-32  5  S c h m id t R    I y e n g a r  M    B e a t y  D    a n d  S h r i v a s ta v a  S    Thermal Profile of a High Density Data Center  Hot Spot Heat Fluxes of 512 Watts/ft 2  Proceedings of the ASHRAE A nnual Meeting Symposium DE-05-11 Denver June 25 th 29 th 2005  6  S c h m id t R     E f f e c t  o f  D a t a  C e n te r  C h a r a c te r i s tic s  o n  D a ta  Processing Equipment Inlet Temperatures Advances in Electronic Packaging Proceedings of the Pacific Rim/ASME International Electronic Packaging Technical Conference and Exhibition Interpack Vol 2 Paper IPACK2001-15870 Kauai, Hawaii, July 8-13, pp. 1097-1106 \(2001  7  S c h m id t R    C r u z  E   a n d  M   K   I y e n g a r    C h a lle n g e s  o f  data center thermal management IBM Journal of Research and Development, Volume 49, Number 4/5, \(2005  8  B h o p te  S    I y e n g a r  M    S a m m a k ia  B    S c h m id t R  a n d  Agonafer D Numerical modeling of data center clusters  immpact of model complexity Proceedings of the International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Chicago, Illinois, November \(2006  9  B h o p te  S    S a m m a k ia  B    I y e n g a r  M    S c h m id t R  a n d  Agonafer D Effect of Under-Floor Blockages on Data Center Performance Proceedings of the Inter-Society Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems ITherm San Diego California June 2006  10  B h o p te  S    S a m m a k ia  B    I y e n g a r  M    a n d  S c h m id t  R    Guidelines on Managing Under Floor Blockages for Improved Data Center Performance Proceedings of the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress IMECE\, Chicago, November \(2006  11  B h o p te  S    A g o n a f e r  D    S c h m id t  R   a n d  S a m m a k ia  B    Optimization of Data Center Room Layout to Minimize Rack Inlet Air Temperature Journal of Electronic Packaging December 2006, Vol. 128, Issue 4, pp. 380  387  12  B a s h   C  E   P a te l  C  D   S h a r m a   R  K    D y n a m ic  Thermal Management of Air Cooled Data Centers Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems San Diego California June 2006  13  B e ite lm a l M  H    P a te l C     T h e r m o F l u id s  P r o v is io n i n g  of a High Performance High Density Data Center HPL-2004146R1, September 24, 2004  14  S h a r m a  R    B a s h  C    P a te l C    F r ie d r ic h  R    a n d  C h a s e  J    Balance of power  dynamic thermal management of internet data centers, Published by IEEE Computer Society, January pp. 42-49, \(2005

with correlation and Rayleigh resolution for source in corner of pixel 5. CONCLUSIONS The psf correlation technique while only slightly better then the threshold detector in the best case scenario, NEO in center of pixel, is a great improvement over the threshold detector in more difficult scenarios such as NEO close to edge of a pixel and telescope optics not properly aligned for correct seeing at time of data collection These factors make ground-based telescopes a viable option for detecting NEOs of 140 meters and larger by incorporating the psf correlation technique at Nyquist resolution; thereby, saving money versus using expensive space-based telescopes. Also, ground-based telescopes are more numerous and multiple ground-based telescopes can scan more sky than one space-based telescope. Multiple ground-based sites can be used for statistical purposes of improving asteroid detection [4]. Multiple ground-based images can be averaged to reduce the background noise thereby, increases detection probability. Also, space-based telescopes are more difficult to acquire time, so groundbased telescopes are a more viable option for NEO detection Space telescopes incur significant costs and expensive maintenance and can have long down times waiting for maintenance. If the correlation process described in this paper were used for ground-based telescopes, cost-savings could be significant while detection capabilities would only be slightly impacted The NEO report uses Rayleigh resolution in order to increase the number of NEO photons within one pixel to increase detection probability using a threshold detector The psf correlation process uses the Nyquist resolution to allow for better definition of the psf within the image. This spreads the NEO photons over more pixels, but the psf correlation process allows for better detection than the NEO report process For ground-based telescopes, elevation is important for the best seeing parameters as mentioned in Section 2. Using the psf correlation can limit the impact of lower elevations on the detection capabilities of a telescope, but not eliminate the detriment of lower elevation. It is still in the best interest of NEO detection to use the highest elevations possible with the best seeing parameters, but where cost prohibits the acquisition of higher elevation this process can help limit the impact The false alarm rate is minimal at SNR 6 as was computed in by equation \(11 the false alarm rate only slightly and the increase in detection capability will greatly outweigh the false alarm rate increase. Figures 5 through 8 show a great improvement from SNR 6, the far left of each graph, to SNR 5. The improvement is typically 2 times better detection probability. The psf correlation process improves 8 the detection capabilities for NEOs. The psf correlation process exceeds the NEO reports requirement of 90 detection of NEOs with a visual magnitude of 20.7. It could also detect a majority of NEOs over 50 meters The psf correlation process will require significant computational time and resources. This can be overcome by segmenting the images to be correlated and distributing them to several processers. This is a significant difference between the psf correlation process and the standard threshold detection process used today. The computational intensity of this process can be handled by most mainframes Movement of the NEO within the image from pixel to pixel during exposure is an issue for both the NEO report process and the process described in this paper. Integration must be long enough to allow for enough photons for detection, but 


long enough to allow for enough photons for detection, but not so long as to allow the NEO to move into another pixel thereby distributing it  s photons into more pixels while the background intensity increases 6. CONCLUSION Nyquist resolution with psf correlation has been shown to be less affected by the atmospheric seeing parameter than just using a threshold detector alone. Using a psf correlation technique for Nyquist resolution images has been shown to increase the probability to discover NEOs over the current aliasing and threshold technique in all situations addressed in this paper ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The opinions and views expressed by the authors are not necessarily those of the Department of Defense or the United States Air Force REFERENCES 1] Near-Earth Object Science Definition Team, Study to Determine the Feasibility of Extending the Search for Near-Earth Objects to Smaller Limiting Diameters August 22, 2003 2] E.

Figure 15  ISM Data Flow serializer highlighted in yellow the design to ensure the clock-to-outputs of the individual serial signals were all matched indicating that at least on chip the design had no skew Finally we used a test bed layout with HyperLynx to prove that our part to part latencies were within acceptable ranges given the high design speed FPGA Design Rate The FPGA design used to verify the design speed was a relatively simple 8-bit latch and shift register shown in Figure 14 Figure 14 shows that the base clock is twice as fast as the output clock which is meant to simulate a recovered clock This is not necessarily a design requirement but would be necessary if the telemetry clock were an input to the design as was the case on the WISE mission This implies that the maximum frequency given by the timing tool for the design is twice the output clock Figure 14 shows only an 8-bit shift register but naturally depending on how the memory was organized more might be required The more bits used in the shift register the more internal clock skew slows the design If a wider bus were required it would be better to increase the depth of the input registers to maintain a high-speed design as opposed to increasing the number of output shift registers The results of this test were a maximum device clock speed of 336.7 MHz double data rate and a maximum output clock speed of 168.35 MHz in the Actel RTAX2000S as given by Actel Timing Designer This meets our requirement of 150 MHz on the clock signal with a margin of 12 FPGA Design Skew Using this same prototype design and mapping the outputs to physical pins we ensured the pin-to-pin skew was matched This skew is the amount of time it takes the edge to propagate from the internal logic to the physical pin on the part The results were as follows Path 1 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 2 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK N Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 3 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 4 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA N Clock to Out ns 7.014 The clock-to-output skews are all matched indicating the clock and data signals leave the part simultaneously and no delay is caused by mismatched skew Board Latency Simulation After a preliminary board layout was completed board simulations were performed on the signals from the FPGA to the LVDS repeater and ultimately to the front panel as shown in Figure 16 All of these simulations were performed in HyperLynx Boardsim 8.0 with manufacturer-provided IBIS models for the Integrated Circuits ICs The waveform given in Figure 17 is captured at the FPGA Figure 16  ISM Data Flow buffer highlighted in yellow Figure 17  FPGA LVDS output waveform simulations green/red  single-ended clock at FPGA blue  differential clock at destination The HyperLynx simulation was performed using a signal switching speed of 180 MHz to ensure adequate margin for the desired signal frequencies The rise times given in Table 9 are roughly one-tenth the simulated signal period 5.5 ns at 180 Mhz indicating they will not impede the switching frequency by slowing the time to the threshold voltage at the receiver The simulated scope shots for these signals indicate crisp edges and transitions The receiving part is an LVDS bus repeater meant to protect the radiation-hardened FPGA from any front-panel transients that might inadvertently occur during testing At the input to the repeater the simulated signal waveform is given in Figure 18 The transition regions for LVDS are shown as blue lines in Figure 18 While there is a considerable amount of overshoot 11 


Figure 18  LVDS signals at buffer input difference shown and re\003ections on the signal line from the repeater the transition region of the signal is very clean even simulated at 180 MHz This will easily meet our 150 MHz frequency requirement Signal characteristics are tabulated in Table 9 Signal Rise Time ps Fall Time ps Undershoot mV Overshoot mV Margin mV CLK 729.0 698.4 212 250 288 CLK903.1 685.4 256 150 244 DATA 738.9 702.8 216 250 284 DATA876.4 717.8 256 150 244 Table 9  FPGA LVDS output signal characteristics In addition to signal characteristics and waveforms the signal-to-signal skew was measured at the buffer input Obviously these values should be as small as possible to prevent modifying the board Like most differential signaling modes LVDS requires matched impedance signal pairs to function optimally HyperLynx was used to 002ne tune the termination on each differential pair and to match all of the trace impedances to this termination The skew was minimal Table 10 First LVDS Signal Second LVDS Signal Receiving Rise Skew ps Receiving Fall Skew ps CLK DATA 58.32 50.54 Table 10  LVDS rising and falling skew measured at receiver The Receiving Rise and Fall skews are the values for skew between the two signals as each signal passes the LVDS threshold voltage measured at the FPGA The time difference between these two crossings is the number shown in Table 10 Rise skew is measured on the rising edge and fall skew is measured on the falling edge as illustrated in Figure 19 Figure 19  LVDS receiver slew measurement Given that these skews were measured at 180 MHz skew between signals at 150 MHz will not inhibit data transfer by allowing the clock and data lines to get out of sync 6 C ONCLUSIONS It is clear that there are many places where timing is of great concern in the ISM data 003ow The initial data input is driven by the instrument interface timing the bandwidth of the FPGA FIFO buffers the speed of the formatter FPGA and the bandwidth of write accesses to the 003ash-memory The transmitter side of the data 003ow is dependent on the bandwidth of the read accesses to the 003ash-memory the FPGA FIFO buffer bandwidth the FPGA serializer frequency and the physical signal characteristics of the FPGA to the frontpanel interface A table summarizing all of these bandwidths in the order they occur in the data 003ow is presented in Table 11 Data Flow Block Bandwidth Units INSTRUMENT INPUT FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps Formatter FPGA Bandwidth 328 Mbps Flash-memory Write Bandwidth 104 Mbps TRANSMITTER OUTPUT Flash-memory Read Bandwidth 866 Mbps FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps FPGA Serializer Bandwidth 168 Mbps Table 11  Bandwidth summary In order to support our study signal integrity analysis was performed on the portions of the data 003ow affected by physical delays including into and out of the 003ash-memory and from the FPGA to the front panel These physical interfaces are robust enough to support high data throughput rates The ISM is capable of interfacing to an instrument with up to 104 Mbps of continuous data throughput and is capable of 12 


sourcing data to a transmitter at a bandwidth up to 168 Mbps This allows data to be stored to the ISM during the orbital encounter period and downlinked periodically as communications are available R EFERENCES  223R T AX-S/SL RadT olerant FPGAs 224 Actel Corporation Mountain View CA 2008 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/products/milaero/rtaxs/docs.aspx  223Prototyping R T AX-S Using Axcelerator Devices,\224 2003 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/techdocs/appnotes/rtaxs.aspx  223K9XXG08XXM Datasheet 2G x 8 Bit  4G x 8 Bit  8G x 8 Bit NAND Flash Memory,\224 Samsung Electronics 2007  223UT54A CS164245S/SE Schmitt CMOS 16-bit Bidirectional MultiPurpose Transceiver Datasheet,\224 Aero\003ex Corporation Colorado Springs CO 2009 Available http://aero\003ex.com/ams/pagesproduct/prodshirel-16bitlogic.cfm B IOGRAPHY  John Dickinson is a Research Engineer at Southwest Research Institute Having studied Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University with a focus on control systems and signals he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division He was the lead Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for the WISE and Kepler Mission Unique Boards MUB for which he compiled and integrated the GSE hardware developed the test scripts and wrote and veri\002ed the GSE code He is the Lead Engineer for the JUNO JADE Instrument Processor Board a lowpower RAD-HARD 3U Compact PCI single-board computer that utilizes the Atmel LEON2 SPARC v8 processor and provides direct instrument and spacecraft serial interfaces He has supported integration systems engineering and promotional efforts on a variety of programs and is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology Charlie Howard  a Principal Engineer in the Department of Space Systems at Southwest Research Institute excels as system architect and digital designer with particular expertise in FPGA and ASIC design Mr Howard has 002lled an active role in the hardware/software architecture for the MMS Mass Memory Module MMM and is the designer of the Mass Memory Controller FPGA Mr Howard is the architect and designer of WISE Mission Unique Board MUB the Kepler Command and Telemetry Board CTB and the Orbital Express CTB and provided multiple FPGA designs for OE Kepler WISE and MMS As Kepler CTB lead he incorporated new simulation capabilities allowing the customer to verify advanced features of the Kepler CTB prior to delivery As an ASIC and FPGA designer Mr Howard 002lled roles in RTL design functional and gate level veri\002cation for high reliability systems including space telecom and defense applications His other interests are worst-case timing and signal integrity analyses Steven Torno is an Electrical Engineer at Southwest Research Institute He studied Electrical Engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute for Technology with a focus on digital signal processing and he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division in 2009 He was the Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for a Control and Telemetry Board CTB demo in partnership with ATK Space Systems where he integrated existing GSE hardware with custom test software he wrote and veri\002ed He is currently an Electrical Engineer for the Robotic Lander Test Bed project working on the Low Voltage Power Supply LVPS board He is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at San Antonio 13

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
