This does not provide the necessary random seeking functionality  5.4.4  Network Bandwidth RTP packets constructed at the caller end will travel through the GPRS network in our case, the theoretical bandwidth of GPRS is about 114 kbps while the size of audio data is 64 kbps This shows that the bandwidth is sufficient to accommodate our design with very little jitter   6  CONCLUSION AND FURTHER ENHANCEMNT  We have showcased in this paper the attempt of earlier work related to transfer of voice over mobile devices and our design as well as implementation of voice communications over GGSN/SGSN in PART 1 and partial Working model of PART II were also evaluated As discussed in PART II, the application designed in J2ME can deliver RTP packets with no or less jitter if we use an asterisk exchange. SDP is used to negotiate media sessions description between both the MS. The media session description contains sampling rate of voice packets and Socket for receiving voice packets. Once the session is established through SIP, SDP is used for voice communication. Although our PART II design is complete it still needs some further enhancement to go through in order to achieve a high Quality of Service for voice \(QoS\ well as Qual ity of Experience for video QoE\d compatibility with handsets manufactured by different companies. The QoE still needs to be tested Furthermore in India we have mixed population of CDMA as well as GSM/GPRS/EDGE cellular users, and our PART I as well as PART II are both not compatible with the CDMA technology because the handsets supplied by the CDMA operators are propriety and no contents can be downloaded to these handsets except theirs. The second most important thing at this juncture is that there is no way out for one MS to know whether another MS wants to initiate a call with it. Based on our PART II design we propose the following enhancement to accomplish and achieve the goal as discussed  To enhance the J2ME application based on our PART 2 design which is compatible with handsets manufactured by different companies and not only with Nokia 6220? This can be accomplished by designing a generic application in J2ME independent of the handsets However some handsets are even older to support the latest J2ME application, so this can be accomplished by using an application which can detect the browser as well as software version of the handset and send the required application as per the capacity of the handset  To accomplish the QoE and QoS our application must be capable to transfers the voice packets when the packets exceed the size equivalent to 6 seconds, after the callee has elapsed 3 seconds of voice, the caller application sends the next packet. This new packet should take another 2 seconds \(max\ at the callee application and should be ready in the buffer to deliver at the callee socket through the Asterisk Server. The server must be enhanced in order to process maximum voice files and connection sockets  The third enhancement can be incorporated in our PART 2 design is to support the feature of Audio conferencing which is possible only in 3G over IMS. If this feature is incorporated in our design it will have the capability to support n-number of users simultaneously for the conference  REFRECENCES 1  Rao, H.

focus from the directors is still strong so just keep it up MEN fokuset er fortsatt sterkt fra ledelsen s her er det bare  st p In \(6\d \(7\e leader tells her group that they draw attention from the top, and simultaneously encourages the group to work hard. TCM is a large multinational corporation with approximately 1100 employees in Norway. The distance between the top management and employees is great, and in this context there might be a strong competition in drawing attention from the leaders, and to be noticed and appreciated as an employee. When the Agenda-leader repeatedly stresses that the Agendagroup has focus from the top, and even congratulates them, she is creating a picture of Agenda as a unique group, with great importance and value for the company. This might in itself serve as a rhetoric device to motivate the group and create stronger inside-relations The next section \(4.2\tifies how the leader is positioning herself vis--vis her subordinates Quantifications made in a forthcoming study of the Agenda-group showed that the Agenda-leader in sum sent the most messages in the group, and that her dominating speech acts were requests Hence, a great part of the leaders work consists of telling others to do something. According to politeness theory k i n g so m e on e to do something is a face-threatening act \(FTA\he analysis examines how the Agenda leader linguistically presents the request. To which extent does she mitigate the requests by using positive or negative politeness? What does the linguistic form of her requests signal about the position the leader is taking towards her subordinates 4.2 The leader positioning herself vis--vis subordinates The Agenda leader performs requests by using positive politeness strategies \(strategy 2\ in most of her requests to her team members. She compensate for the FTA by presenting the request as wishes and hopes, rather than commands. The constructions that are most frequent are I need help from you to, Hope you have/can and nice if 8 I need help from you concerning the budgets of letters, internet and m  Jeg trenger hjelp fra dere vedr dagens budsjetter for brev fastnett, internett og mob  9 Hope it is possible for you to con Hper du har mulighet til ta kontakt    10 Hope you may respond within Wednesday at 4PM Hper dere kan svare innen onsdag kl 1600 11  t it is nice if you send me your comments on email  progression is importan  men det er fint om du sender meg innspillene p mail - viktig at vi kommer videre The Agenda-leaders requests are formulated as a declaratives, rather than interrogatives or imperatives. Furthermore, the requests are formulated as needs, hopes and wishes. She expresses her self in psychological terms \(wish and hopes\er than in normative ones \(obligation By presenting the requests as a need for help, a wish or a hope the leader presents the request as a personal wish rather than an institutional obligation All in all, this contributes to downgrade her institutional role, in favor of a more personal role. Alternatively the Agenda-leader could have presented her requests in a normative way, for instance by using interrogatives and imperatives These are more explicit ways of enacting institutional power. However, by using less forceful strategies and presenting the requests as needs and hopes, the leader is presenting the requests as speech acts that need little compensation. She is optimistic, assuming that the recipients will comply with the request, something which simultaneously implies common ground and familiarity with the recipients. Instead of explicitly enacting power, the Agenda-leader downgrades her institutional role, in favor of building socio-emotional ties with her subordinates Furthermore, the Agenda leader also goes off record \(strategy 4\ performing the requests. She does not perform the request directly, but leaves it to the recipient to interpret the request out of the context or work-place routine 12 Tore, concerning our talk.

one, he knows that it is a request. By using the declarative form, the leader LM avoids presenting the request directly, and thereby she manifests less power Another indirect strategy LM uses is to perform directives laterally, through so called informatives. Statements directed to a primary recipient in an email message may function as an indirect request to secondary recipient who receives the e-mail as a copy 13 Arvid returns to you on this point L Atle kommer tilbake til deg p dette punktet L In example \(13\rvid is a secondary recipient, i.e the mail is CC-ed to him. In the sentence in \(13 LM performs two speech acts, one directly to the primary recipient  a statement, and one indirectly directed to AL, as an indirect request. As in example \(12\e leader leaves it up to the information director to iden tify the request from the context and comply with it So far, we have seen that the Agenda-leader uses positive politeness \(strategy 2\ and indirect strategies \(strategy 4\when performing requests to the members of Agenda. However, when the Agenda-leader performs requests to, or negotiates with, partners outside of Agenda, she uses more direct strategies. These are often followed by a warrant, or are anchored in her professional role as a leader 14 Hi Lise Marit Long time no see : - \ I hope everything is okay in Steinkjer!!

By underscoring words \(ett brev/one letter and even using capital letters \(NOT\e emphasizes the propositional content and signals strong emotional involvement and authority. By continuing with grounding her rejection in Arvid Lerviks role as superordinate, and even copying him in, she shows that she has Lervik on her side This strengthens her authority and makes it difficult for Engseth to reject the decision 5 Discussion 5.1 Summary The analysis of the Agenda-leaders communicative actions showed that she uses different discursive devices in in-group and out-group communication When writing messages to the Agenda-group, she mostly uses an informal style and does not make explicit relevant leadership categorizations Requests are performed with positive politeness strategies \(closeness strategies and indirect strategies\gnaling a socio-emotional, personal relationship with her subordinates. On the contrary when writing messages to out-group partners, the leader uses a more formal style and makes hierarchical categories relevant. Requests are performed with direct strategies, grounded in her position as a leader or with reference to her superordinates wishes The Agenda leader predominantly uses a rhetoric which creates a positive and attractive image of the group. The analysis identified three devices which contribute to build up the groups image. First, by using addressing devices and positive loaded nick-names she compliments \(and categorizes\e members and invites them to identify with the picture/category she presents Second, the leader makes use of metaphors as narrating devices. Metaphors as blessing journey and blessing round contribute to creating a picture of the team as main characters in a successstory. In addition, by using metaphors from economics \(to sell in Agenda\e leader compares Agenda with a valuable product. Finally, the Agenda leader provides feedback to the group by informing that they have attention from the topleaders. To have the top-leaders attention may signal that the groups work really is making a difference in the huge company. Providing this information may be a performance management device h ic h m i gh t serv e t o  stren gth e n  relatio n s  inside the team. In sum, the rhetorical devices which the Agenda-leader uses in her in-group communication contribute to creating a positive image of the group. She presents the group as being enthusiastic about their work and as being valuable for the company, something which may invite to group identification, establish involvement, trust and maybe increased participation Despite that all the members of this distributed group belong to different departments, and in addition other distributed work groups in the company as well, it seems that the leader manages to create an image of Agenda as a unique group. It may even be associated with what Bell and Kozlowski refer to as a third cultur   However, to confirm this, the groups actual perceptions of being members of the group need to be examined through interviews. This has not been the purpose in the present study. A great part of the leaders messages to the group are requests.

she performs requests, she does not explicitly make her role as the leader explicitly relevant. Rather, she compensate for the request by using positive politeness strategies. This corresponds with Mullany \(2004\d the findings in the Language in the Workplace project [20, 26 By  u s i ng closeness strategies, the Agenda-leader presupposes common ground and familiarity, something which makes her appear as an egalitarian leader who trusts her team members and encourages them to act independently Despite the fact that the leader of Agenda by linguistic form appears as egalitarian and present in in-group communication she constitutes herself more as an authority towards externally co-workers When writing messages to out-group partners, she tends to use a more formal style. When performing requests, she uses more direct strategies and ground the requesting acts in her position as a leader, or refers to super-ordinates. By referring to hierarchical roles, she is making power categories overtly relevant. This may be an effective device to pursue a quick compliance to a request. Second, the Agenda-leader makes hierarchical categories explicitly relevant when managing conflicts This study has primarily shown that the Agenda-leader does not make hierarchical categories relevant when writing messages to the team-members. Her authority is downplayed, or back grounded, in favor of an emotional, personal relationship with her employees. These findings illustrate Fairhursts point that hierarchy categorizations often are unspok h e Agenda-leader Line Myhre does not need to explicitly qualify herself as a leader each time she posts a request. Her appointed role as the leader of Agenda gives her an exclusive right to perform requests and the members are obliged to comply. In addition, the institutional role is enacted implicitly by the rhetorical devices identified in this study Her leadership role is constituted by and through the actions which she performs. Evaluating motivating and requesting are leadership actions 36  W h e n Li ne M yhr e p o s ts me ssa ge s to o u t group co-workers, she does not have the same exclusive right, or can not take for granted that the recipients will comply with her requests, since she is not their leader. Therefore, the requests need to be grounded in her institu tional role, or anchored in her super-ordinates wish 5.2 Doing leadership is building trust The leadership carried out in Agenda seems to a great extent to be grounded on trust. In the present article, this has been exemplified by the addressing devices, the nick names, and the leaders use of positive politeness when performing requests A characteristic of virtual teams and computermediated networks is that boundaries are permeable, interactions are with diverse others connections switch between multiple networks, and hierarchies can be flatter and recursive \(\he community exists more in the informal networks than predefined work-groups. Rather than fitting into the same group as those around them, each person has his/her own personal community [37   Wellman \(2001\ers to this phenomenon as networked individualism ris k  w i t h t h e  networked individualism is that the social life at the work place may be fragmented, and that no one fully knows each other Where person-to person community is individualizing, role-to-role community deconstructs a holistic individual identity A person becomes only the sum of her roles, and there is the danger of alienation The compartmentalization of personal life within the household and within the community  may create an insecure milieu where no one fully knows anyone Wellman 2001:17 The leadership practices carried out in Agenda which is grounded on trust, may demonstrate an attempt to reduce these risks As mentioned in the review, one of the challenges for leaders of virtual teams is to duplicate the two key functional leader roles to the virtual team \(team development and performance management\ According to Bell and Kozlowski [6  this includes the leaders need to closely monitor any changes in environmental conditions Additionally it includes to motivating team members to commit strongly to the overall team effort and need to facilitate team coherence especially under high intensity conditions. In virtual teams, as in Agenda where people only rarely meet face-to-face, these functions are challenged. However, the leader seems to attempt to create a positive climate in the group, both by rhetorical devices as giving the group a nick-name and by providing receipts and acknowledgements in third position responses. These characteristics belong to the team-development function addition, arranging regular face to face meetings belongs to the performance management function Conclusively, the leader seems to duplicate both of the important leader functions Computer-mediated communication provides great opportunity for leaders to send out important information, request and monitor their members Even though the team-members are physically distant, the technology facilitates constraint-free communication and hyperconnectivity, i.e. the availability for people to communicate anywhere and anytim ai l  m a y f o s t er s o cial  presence in a greater extent than face-to-face, in the sense that e-mail messages are persistent and thus Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 
 


having more pervasive force. This makes it possible for leaders to appear powerful, even on a distance Interestingly, with respect of the amounts of messages, the reminders and extent of feedback [29  e A g e n da leader appears as a po w e rfu l  leader, displaying her hierarchical position in the group. Simultaneously, her methods of creating in group solidarity and performing requests, shows that her institutional role is back grounded as she enacts egalitarian leadership building socioemotional ties within the team 6.
