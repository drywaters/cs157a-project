 7. Conclusions  In this paper we have proposed an intelligent and efficient technique to reassess the distances between dynamic XML documents when one or all of the initially clustered documents have changed. After the changes, the initial clustering solution might become obsolete - the distances between clustered XML documents might have changed more or less depending on the degree of modifications \(insert update, delete\hich have been applied. Re-running full pair-wise comparisons on the entire set of modified documents is not a viable option, because of the large number of redundant operations involved Our proposed technique allows the user to reassess the pair-wise XML document distances, not by fully comparing each new pair of versions in the clustering solution, but by determining the effect of the temporal changes on the previously known distances between them. This approach is both time and I/O effective, as the number of operations involved in distance reassessing is greatly reduced  References  1  Beringer, J. and H\374llermeier, E., Online clustering of parallel data streams Data and Knowledge Engineering 58\(2\,  2006, 180-204 2  Catania, B. and Maddalena A., A Clustering Approach for XML Linked Documents, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22202\, IEEE 2002 3  Chen, M.S., Han, J. and Yu, P., Data Mining: An Overview from Database Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol. 8, 1996, 866-883 4  Cormen, T., Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R Introduction to algorithms, MIT Press, 1990 5  Costa, G., Manco, G., Ortale, R. and Tagarelli, A., A tree-based Approach to Clustering XML documents by Structure, PAKDD 2004, LNAI 3202, 137-148 Springer 2004 6  Dalamagas, T., Cheng, T., Winkel, K.J. and Sellis, T 2004, Clustering XML documents by Structure SETN 2004, LNAI 3025, 112-121, Springer 2004 7  Ester, M., Kriegel, H.P., Sander, J., Wimmer,M. and Xu, X., Incremental Clustering for Mining in a Data Warehousing Environment, Proc.of the 24 th VLDB Conference, New York, USA, 1998 8  Garofalakis, M., Rastogi, R., Seshadri, S.

5 Related Work There exists extensive previous work on both the mining of software repositories and on the use of clustering algorithms in software engineering This discussion focuses on the most similar and recent work in the area of software evolution Mining Software Repositories Our technique was partially inspired by the work of Zimmermann et al and Y ing et al 17 on the mining of association rules in change history As described in Section 1 we sought to expand the technique to be able to recommend larger but less precise clusters of elements to guide program navigation Bouktif et al also investigated how to recommend cochanges in software development As opposed to the work cited above Bouktif et al used change patterns instead of association rules Also their approach does not attempt to reconstruct transactions and can consider associated 002les that were changed in different transactions ChangeDistiller is a tool to classify changes in a transaction into 002ne-grained operations e.g addition of a method declaration and determines how strongly the change impacts other source code entities Our approach uses similar repository analysis techniques but is focused on providing task-related information as opposed to an overall assessment of a system's evolution Finally repository mining can also be used to detect aspects in the code In this conte xt aspects are recurring sets of changed elements that exhibit a regular structure Aspects differ from the clusters we detect in the regular structure they exhibit which may not necessarily align with the code that is investigated as part of change tasks Clustering Analysis The classical application of clustering for reverse engineering involves grouping software entities based on an analysis of various relations between pairs of entities of a given version of the system Despite its long and rich history  e xperimentation with this approach continues to this day For example Andreopoulos et al combined static and dynamic information K uhn et al used a te xtual similarity measure as the clustering relation and Christl et al used clustering to assist iterative semi-automated reverse engineering The main dif ferences b e tween most clusteringbased reverse engineering techniques and the subject of our investigation is that the entities we cluster are transactions rather than software entities in a single version of a system For this reason our analysis is based strictly on the evolving parts of the system Both Kothari et al and V an ya et al 15 recently reported on their use of clustering to study the evolution of software systems The idea of using change clusters is the same in both works and ours but the purpose of the work is different Kothari et al use change clusters to uncover the types of changes that happened e.g feature addition maintenance etc during the history of a software system Vanya et al use change clusters which they call evolutionary clusters to guide the partitioning of a system that would increase the likelihood that the parts of the system would evolve independently In contrast we cluster transactions based on overlapping elements not 002les to recommend clusters to support program navigation as opposed to architectural-level assessment of the system Finally Hassan and Holt evaluated on 002ve open source systems the performance of several methods to indicate elements that should be modi\002ed together This study found that using historical co-change information as opposed to using simple static analysis or code layout offered the best results in terms of recall and precision The authors then tried to improve the results using 002ltering heuristics and found that keeping only the most frequently cochanged entities yielded the best results As opposed to our approach the evaluated 002ltering heuristics were only applied on entities recovered using association rules and not using clustering techniques The focus of their study was also more speci\002c as they recommend program elements that were strictly changed  as opposed to recommending elements that might be inspected by developers 6 Conclusion Developers often need to discover code that has been navigated in the past We investigated to what extent we can bene\002t from change clusters to guide program navigation We de\002ned change clusters as groups of elements that were part of transactions or change sets that had elements in common Our analysis of close to 12 years of software change data for a total of seven different open-source systems revealed that less than 12 of the changes we studied could have bene\002ted from change clusters We conclude that further efforts should thus focus on maximizing the quality of the match between the current task and past transactions rather than 002nding many potential matches Our study has already helped us in this goal by providing reliable evidence of the effectiveness of some 002ltering heuristics and useful insights for the development of additional heuristics Acknowledgments The authors thank Emily Hill and Jos  e Correa for their advice on the statistical tests and the
