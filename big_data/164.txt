However there exist some problems in the strong association rules mining.

In the paper, we think that the weighted intemtingness and cover of measure criteria should he added to association rules mining, thus the weighted interestingness makes it essy Lor users to mine interesting association rules and the cover of association rules makes it simple for user8 to reduce the amount of awxiation rules, then the efficiency and veracity of mining association rules are improved Keywords Association rule; Apriori, frequent itemsets, data mining 1. Introduction Nowadays, association rules [I' mining is an important task of data mining, which describes potential relationships among data items \(attribute, variant idea of which was fmtly proposed by R. Agrawal et al. in 1993, before long realized by the well-known Apriori algorithm 'I, which was an influential algorithm for mining frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules. Usually most all of algorithms are improved on the basis of the algorithm, According to the popular measure criteria of association rules mining, we can mine these strong association rules, which should satisfy two conditions support and confidence However, mining association rules by the popular measure criteria, there exist some shortcomings. In this paper, we have introduced added-newly measure criteria to association rules mining, 'which are weighfed 0-7803-8403-2/04/$20.00 IEEE inferestingness '3.4s1 and cover of association rule .that help to mine the interesting association rules and reduce the amount of association rules. Then the efficiency and veracity of mining association rules are improved 2. The popular association rules Association rules mining can he stated as follows: Let I=[&amp;, if. ... in data, be a set of transactions in a supermarket, where each transaction T is a set of items such that T d .  The quantities of items bought are not considered. Each transaction is assigned an identifier, called TID. Let A he a set of items, a transaction T is said to contain A if and only if ACT. An association rule is an implication of the form A=% where A d ,  BcI, and AnB=0.  The rule A*B holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain AuB \(i.e., both A and B This is taken to be the probability P\(AuB has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to he the conditional probability P\(BIA A=+B AuB A+B BIA A*B A The popular association rules Mining is to mine strong association rules that satisfy the user-specified both 


association rules that satisfy the user-specified both minimum support threshold and confidence threshold 3. Association rule mining with added -newly measure criteria According to the popular measure criteria, support and confidence, there exist some shortcomings, There are a great number of redundant, false, non-interesting strong association rules, thus it is difficult for users to find interesting association rules, therefore we think that the weighted interestingness and cover of measure criteria 1107 should be added to association rules mining in order that the weighted interestingness make it easy for users to mine interesting association rules, and the cover of association le^ make it simple for users to reduce the amount of association rules, then the efficiency and veracity of mining rules are improved As above mentioned in Section 2, Let D be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items such that TcI. The quantities of items having been bought are not considered. Here, we should think about the importance of the quantities of items customers have bought, as we know that the more the quantities of something bought in a supermarket is, the more money the retailers of the supermarket would have eamed, thus those items are very important for them, in other words, the retailers are interested in those items, in the course of association rules mining, they would pay more attention to them, or else, if more attention was paid to those unimportant items, they would make improper decisions, eam less money, even go into bankruptcy, therefore, we should mine the interesting association rules 3.1 The weighted interestingness of association rules A set of items I=\(&amp;, it. ... in weighted value pjdetermined by users or experts of domain knowledge according to some criteria, that is: % p j&lt; 1.0, j A typical example of association rules mining with weighted interestingness is market basket analysis association rules can help retailers develop market sbategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers, hence, the retailers demand an objective business analysis on selling their merchandise. As we know, those different kinds of merchandise maybe have different weighted values, so we can set a weighted threshold k, if the weighted value &amp; of item i, is bigger than k, then we think that the retailers is interested in item i,, thus association rule having been mined from those items is all useful rules on the hasis of the weighted interestingness we have found out a lot of methods to calculate weighted value p, of each item iJ on the basis of some criteria, such as the profit method. the capital turnover method. the marketing cost method and so on. Now we calculate them based on the profit method In a period, because it is not right that any merchandise brings the retailers a lot of profit, it is true in some cases, then the weighted values of these items will have high values, while the other is false, then the weighted values of these items will have low values, these weighted values of these items can be calculated by the means: the weighted value p, of item iJ =the profit sum of item i, / all profit sum of all items, that is to say, the weighted value of item i, equal to the profit sum of item i, divided by all profit sum of all items Now that we can calculate weighted value p, of each item iJ on the basis of the capital "over method, the marketing cost method, the rest may be deduced by analogy 3.2 The cover of association rules As similarly as the definition of association rule in Section 2, it said that the rule A 3 B  has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D 


transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the conditional probability P\(B1A A*B P\(BIA AdB A that the association rule A a B  has cover k in the transaction set D if k is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the conditional probability P\(A1B A+B P\(AIB B*A B We introduce the cover to association rule with the purpose for cutting down the amount of association mles to a half. Since the Cover of the association rule A*B can keep the information of Confidence of the association rule B q  A, we do not need to mine the association rule B * A then the redundant association rules can be reduced a lot of From the definition of Support, Confidence, Weighted interestingness Cover of association rule mining, the property of association rules can be viewed from different perspectives Support shows us that the association rule hold at how much extent; Confidence tells us that the association rule hold true at how much probability; Weighted interestingness presents us that the users are getting interested to how much extent in the association rule Cover will help us reduce the amount of association rules to a half, in a word, these parameters will help us to mine the interesting and useful association rules 4. Apriori algorithm The algorithm has become one of the most popular data mining methods, which was proposed by Agrawal et al., The aim of the association rule mining is finding interesting relations among the attributes in the large databases. Many methods have been improved to reduce the number of scans and candidates by hashing, sampling Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Macbine Learning and Cybemetics, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 1188 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 partitioning, dynamic itemset counting, parallel computing etc. but the essential of them have not changed Apron algorithm is an influential algorithm for mining frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules, employs an iterative approach known as a Level-wise search, where k-itemsets are used to explore \(k+l of frequent I-itemsets is found. This set is denoted Ll,then LI is used to find L, the set of frequent 2-itemsets, which is used to find L3, and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets can be found. The finding of each Lk requires one full scan of the database. The problem of mining association rules can be decomposed into two major steps 1 itemsets to generate the strong rules. Once all frequent itemsets from transactions in a datahase D have been found it is straightforward to generate strong association rules from them, where strong association rules satisfy both minimum snmort and minimum confidence. in the candidate C3: \(IIIZI3], {1,1215], calculating the support of C3 is U9, 219, respectively, then frequent itemsets can be easily gained, then association rules mining has been finished 5.1 Generating association rules from frequent itemsets with popular measure criteria Once the frequent itemsets from transactions in a database D have been found, we can generate association rules from them, for example, we can select some attribute at random in the literature  I , association rule I lA12ds the support of frequent itemsets [ I I I ~ ]  and {h121s 2/9, respectively, then the confidence of. association rule II is 214, as such 1#11A12, IIAIs=&amp; I~AIs*II I l ~ 1 2 A 1 5 ,  1 2 4  A I ,  whose confidence is U2,U2,  U6, U7 2 4  respectively 


2 4  respectively I meantime, these association rules should satisfy the minimum weighted interestingness. 5.2 Generating sssociation rules from freqnent itemsets with  added-newly measure criteria 5. An example of association rule mining by Apmiri algorithm with criteria  Ompared with added-newly measure criteria Similarly, we can generate association rules from the frequent itemsets with added-newly measure criteria, if the weigbted interestingness and cover of association rules are From the definitions mentioned above, we can mine association rules by Apriori algorithm, taking an Example 6.1 as market basket analysis on page 232 in literature  I, There are 9 transactions and 5 items in ALLEL ectronics transaction database D, that is M=9, the minimum support threshold determined is 119, scan D for count of each candidate, frequent Itemsets C1: {L],[L II],{II],{Is]. whose the support of frequent itemsets is 619,719,619,219, 219, respectively, remove these frequent itemsets whose the support is lower than the minimum support threshold 119, we can easily obtain all those frequentitemsetsLI: \( I l l ,  \(121, {I3], {I candidates from L1, frequent itemsets C2 is those as follows UIIZJ. IIihI. Ihbl. I I iLI ,  { IzSI Table 1 is 4/9, 419, 119, U9, 419, U9, UY 0, 119, 0, respectively, remove T5W T6W 121, J, generate C3 candidates from L, scan D for count of each  adopted, we can obtain the same result, for example, we assume that the weighted interestingness of itemset 11.12.15 are bigger than the minimum weighted interestingness threshold, namely, It is said that the users are interested in them, therefore we will mine association rules about itemset I,, 12, Is, according to the same steps in Section 5.1 association rule I,A12sIs, the support of frequent itemsets 1112 confidence of association rule Il A 1 2 d s  is 214, whose cover is the confidence of the association rules Is I, AI2 as we know, the confidence of the association rules IS 11 AI2 is 212, we do not need to mine the association rule Is 1, AIz, because the cover of the 11 AI2=&amp; is 212, which keeps the information that there exists a association rule Is 1, AI2, whose confidence \(U2 2/2 the association rule I, AI2+, So we can reduce the useful association rules to a half. similarly, the association rules 1 A I S ~ 1 2  and I~=IIIA\\I~ ,  the association rules 1 2 A 1 5 ~ I l  and From the result, Compared with the popular measure criteria, we can know that the same results by the means of generating association rules from frequent itemsets with added-newly measure criteria can be obtained, however because of introducing the weighted interestingness and cover to association rules mining, we can reach the conclusion that the weighted interestingness make it easy Ii*Iz AIS 1189 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 for users to mine interesting associatiop rules, and the cover of association rules make it simple for users to reduce the amount of associ.ation rules, then the efficiency and veracity of association rules mining are improvedL7   6. Conclusions In the paper, we have introduced added-newly measure criteria which are weighted interestingness and cover to association rules mining. As we know, the i m p o m t  attributes should be paid attention to and could not be neglected, thus the weighted interestingness of 


association rules makes it easy for users to mine interesting association rules, and the cover of association rules makes it simple for users to reduce  the amount of association rules then the efficiency and pertinence of mining association rules are improved. In the meantime the searching space of the algorithm has been reduced, therefore compared with the popular measure criteria, we can generate association rules from frequent itemsets with added-newly measure criteria and popular measure criteria hy Apriori algorithm The former is obviously superior to the latter  Acknowledgements The paper is supported the National Natural Science Foundation of P.

Figure 9 Execution time with average number of objects per image varied Figure 10 Execution time with number of objects varied This experiment analyzed the impact when varying the number of objects in database The following lists the major conditions 1 Database size ID1=40000 100000 200000 and 300000 2 Number of objects 101=400 1000 and 1500 3 Average number of objects per image AvgObj=4 8 and 12 4 Support threshold Smin=0.2 5 Number of time periods JTJ=4 From Figure 10 we observe that the larger number of objects will require more the execution time The main reason is that more objects will generate more 1-candidate and 2-candidate patterns and hence both of SP-Miner and CP-Miner need more time to calculate the support of patterns 5 Conclusions In this paper we propose a data mining method that can discover the spatial and temporal object relation pattern in multimedia contents We first adopt the existing segmentation methods to extract the objects from multimedia databases and the location of objects Then the proposed method is applied to discover the spatial patterns and pattern changes The proposed method can be used to analyze interesting object relations in multimedia contents like videos obtained from wirelsee sensor devices Through empirical evaluation the proposed method is shown to deliver excellent performance under different system conditions For the future work we will extend SP-Miner and CP-Miner to deal with more relations like include and cover relations These two relations involve the physical area of objects and advanced extracting techniques Furthermore we will work on the integration with video files and MPEG-4 contents in the wireless environments ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by Ministry of Economic Affairs R.O.C under grant no 92-EC-17-A-02-5 1-024 6 References I in Large Databases Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data pages 207-216 Washington D.C May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R.Srikant Fast Algorithm for Mining Association Rules Proceedings of the Very Large Data Base VLDB-94 pp 487-499 Santiago Chile 1994 3 R Agrawal and R Srikant Mining Sequential Patterns In Proc of the I th Int'l Conference on Data Engineering pages 3-14 Taipai Taiwan March 1995 4 Z.-N Li 0 R Za?ane and Z Tauber Illumination lnvariance and Object Model in Content-Based Image and Video Retrieval Joumal of Visual Communication and Image Representation Academic Press vol 10 R Agrawal T Imielinkski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items n 3 pages 219-244 September 1999 5 C Ordonez and E Omiecinski Image mining A new approach for data mining Technical Report GITCC-98-12 Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing 1998 6 C Ordonez and E Omiecinski Discovering Association Rules based on Image Content Proceedings of the IEEE Advances in Digital Libraries Conference pages 38-49 Baltimore Maryland May 1999 7 R 0 Stehling M A Nascimento and A X Falc?o On shapes of colors for content-based image retrieval Proceedings of the ACM Multimedia 2000 Workshops pp 171-174 November 2000 8 W Wang Y Song and A Zhang Semantics-Based Image Retrieval by Region Saliency Image and Video Retrieval International Conference CIVR 2002 M.S Lew N Sebe J.P Eakins pp 29-37 July 2002 9 0 R Za?ane J Han Z.-N Li J Y Chiang and S Chee MultiMediaMiner A system prototype for multimedia datamining In Proc Int'l Conf on Management of Data ACM-SIGMOD'98 pages 581-583 Seattle June 1998 10 R Za?ane J Han Z.-N Li and J Hou Mining multimedia data In proc CASCON'98 Meeting of Minds pp 83-96 Toronto Canada November 1998 11 R Za?ane J Han and H Zhu Discovering Spatial Associations in Images Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Theory Tools and Technology 11 SPIE 14th Int'l Symposium on Aerospace/Defense Sensing Simulation and Controls pp 138-147 Orlando FL April 2000 12 0 R Za?ane Discovering Patterns With and Within Images Chapter 2 in Multimedia MiningA Highway to Intelligent Multimedia Documents edited by Chabane Djeraba published by Kluwer Accademic Publishers pages 27-42 2002 13 M J Zaki S Parthasarathy W Lin and M Ogihara Evaluation of sampling for data mining of association rules Technical Report 617 University of Rochester Rochester NY 1996 1376

 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simplied to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no benet to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are dened over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
