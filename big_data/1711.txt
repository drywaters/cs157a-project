BIOGRAPHY   13 1 INTRODUCTION In planning for future human exploration activities in a lunar environment the wireless communications infrastructure used will be of critical importance Using standardized communication protocols such as 802.11 can reduce costs enhance interoperability and provide robust networks that build on proven technology and security While long range communications are of great importance short range communications in a lunar environment are 
of increased importance as the loading of local communications e.g voice conversation and real-time video exchanges among astronauts for situational awareness is expected to grow exponentially with the number of network elements The future lunar network will be incrementally realized through a campaign consisting of a series of logistical and explorative missions designed to support the infrastructure required for long duration stays and eventually for a permanent 
lunar outpost A large number of network elements such as habitat modules power generation units mobile robotic vehicles and astronauts must be networked together through shared access to the network infrastructure Applications such as Voice over IP VoIP will be essential to the day-to-day operation in the lunar outpost Additionally deployments must be prepared to support latency sensitive traffic such as command telemetry and real-time video Lunar exploration 
activities will require remote operation from autonomic control systems or by a team of astronauts In all possible scenarios high levels of flexibility service quality and mobility support must be provided by the network There are a number of technical challenges presented by wireless networks due to the shared medium nature of 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

wireless access Performance problems such as low throughput and high delays in networks with even a small number of active stations could jeopardize the mission As the number of nodes and amount of traffic increases on a wireless LAN these issues become more serious While quality of service QoS issues have been studied thoroughly in wired LANs modem high-speed wired networks do not always require complicated QoS due to their relatively high bandwidths error-free nature and abundant switching Applications that have specific bandwidth or latency requirements might not function well in a congested 802.11 network VoIP will experience reduced quality during a call when operating over a network experiencing high latencies or low throughput for the connection 8 Likewise applications using streaming audio and/or video will experience a reduction in quality These problems can be more complex than just low throughput and high delay Large variations in delay can also cause problems with protocols that attempt to adapt to networks with high delay and in turn cause a considerable degradation in service quality As wireless technology is adapted to environments with traffic with different QoS requirements it is important to find solutions for these issues A flexible IP-based selforganizing multiple access network will enhance the operability of future missions that are complex and involve large numbers of mobile nodes but at the same time a new approach to bandwidth management is needed to provide isochronous services to real-time critical data flows over a background of dynamically fluctuating non-real-time telemetry and file transfers The IEEE 802.1 le standard provides enhancements that allow traffic with specific needs to be differentiated from best-effort traffic While these enhancements have been shown to effectively improve latency and throughput for high priority traffic they do not offer precise control of performance levels For example strict prioritization might starve low priority traffic While this could be viewed as acceptable considering the traffic isn't viewed as important in many situations network conditions could allow both high and low priority traffic to find a balance where both experience acceptable service while preserving their priority Further complication is caused by the interaction between the 802.11 MAC layer higher layer protocols and applications requiring different service levels The optimal 802.11 e MAC QoS settings change as network dynamics evolve over time We present a method to dynamically optimize 802.1 e contention parameters to provide more granular control over the network's quality of service QoS A distributed adaptive algorithm that extends 802.1 le's EDCA is presented We show that the enhancement provides more granular and consistent performance than that provided by the static algorithm used in standard 802.1 le This paper is organized as follows We provide a brief background on 802.11 including QoS enhancements provided by 802.1 le Next we summarize related work We describe our methodology and testing process Then we describe preliminary work carried out to identify and illustrate the problem statement Finally we describe the distributed algorithm and show simulation results that demonstrate the benefits of our method We conclude by identifying future work and ways to further test the algorithm presented 2 802.11 WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY The 802.11 set of standards covers telecommunications and information exchange between systems in local and metropolitan area networks 1 The 802.11 standard provides best-effort packet services for the Medium Access Control MAC layer of wireless networks This MAC layer provides wireless stations with fair access to the medium in a best-effort manner In the following sub-sections we review the base 802.11 NIAC protocol The 802.11 MAC Layer The original 802.11 MAC layer is built around two coordination functions that control medium access by the use of distributed coordination and centralized coordination In the Distributed Coordination Function DCF the access control mechanisms are located at the station as opposed to the Point Coordination Function PCF in which control is centralized to the Access Point AP In 802.11 networks DCF is always used although PCF may be used optionally along-side DCF Most 802.11 products support just DCF Collision Management in 802.11 In 802.3 Ethernet networks the primary method for medium access is Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection CSMA/CD in which collisions are detected on the channel and are handled by back-off counters that reduce future collisions by randomly increasing window sizes Detection and recovery are efficient and feasible in wired networks due to the high bandwidth and low packet times of modem networks This reliable nature of wired networks significantly reduces the impacts of collisions In the wireless realm however interference can cause substantial noise resulting in frequently corrupted packets Even more problematic is the fact that channel sensing is not possible since most radios can not simultaneously send and receive 1 For these reasons collision detection is not possible for 802.11 wireless networks motivating the need for CSMA with Collision Avoidance CSMA/CA CSMA/CA works on the principle of listening before transmitting By using wait times efficiently this can lead to an algorithm by which all stations are allowed to gain access to the medium in a relatively fair manner and 2 


minimizing collisions using DCF or PCF or both This algorithm relies on inter-frame spacing to coordinate the communication of the stations Four specific time intervals are defined as follows o SIFS Shortest Inter-Frame Space the wait time between the last transmission and high priority transmissions such as Request To Send RTS and Clear To Send CTS frames and positive acknowledgments ACKs Positive ACK frames are given priority so that currently communicating stations are given immediate feedback on the most recently sent frame Since RTS and CTS frames are control frames they are naturally given priority over other frame types o PIFS PCF Inter-Frame Space the minimum idle time for contention-free access such as PCF this is discussed in detail below This interval allows the point coordinator priority over stations o DIFS DCF Inter-Frame Space the minimum idle time for contention based access such as DCF Any station may claim the medium after this time interval o EIFS Extended Inter-Frame Space minimum wait time for a station that receives corrupted frames The frame spacing intervals allow DCF and PCF to interact seamlessly and with as few collisions as possible by always assuming the following relationship slot time  SIFS  PIFS  DIFS  EIFS The follow diagram shows the relationship of the inter-frame spaces to the access algorithms discussed in the next sections Figure 1 802.11 transmission intervals In Figure 1 taken from 2 it is clear that components that are controlled by smaller time delay intervals will have a distinct advantage over those that use longer time intervals In the following sections it will be shown how these interframe spaces are the basis for providing control mechanisms with priority over stations as well as providing station priority in the absence of centralized control DCF DCF allows stations to transmit without a central coordinator When a station wishes to transmit and has sensed that the medium is free it waits for a DIFS and transmits If during the DIFS the medium becomes busy it begins decrementing a back-off counter that is defined by the Contention Window CW The CW begins equal to CWmin and ends equal to CWmax After each consecutive collision the counter is set to a random value between 0 and CW Each time a collision occurs the CW is increased until it equals CWmax If the CW reaches zero and the medium is still free then the station begins transmitting If during the countdown the medium is seized by another station the station stops the counter and resumes after the transmission period If the station senses the medium to be free reaches a counter value of zero and begins a transmission that results in a collision no ACK received the station will pick a new CW value DCF also includes an optional RTS/CTS mechanism to eliminate the hidden station problem The hidden station problem occurs when two stations can sense transmissions of the AP but not of each other Due to their inability to receive each other's signals the two stations can claim the medium simultaneously and will cause a collision at a central destination To prevent this before sending a frame a station transmits a RTS packet and then receives a CTS packet from the central station Both of these frames include information regarding the time it will take to send the frames which allows other stations to set a timer called the Network Allocation Vector NAV since the medium will be busy at least for that length of time After that time stations begin normal time interval waiting and back-off counter decrementing Since RTS and CTS frames are allowed to be transmitted after a SIFS they have priority over normal DCF transmissions PCF In PCF medium access is controlled by a Point Coordinator PC The PC controls access by looking for stations wishing to transmit during a Contention Period CP and polling stations during a Contention Free Period CFP Together the CP and the CFP form a superframe which repeats for each time period During the CFP PCF is used to control access and then during the CP DCF is used The CFP portion of the superframe begins with a beacon frame that contains management information such as protocol parameters and time synchronization After the beacon frame has been transmitted the PC polls stations in a round-robin manner and upon successful response allows the station to transmit either an ACK indicating it has nothing to send or a DATA+ACK frame Having received no response from a station the PC moves on and the station is not allowed to transmit until the CP or during the next 3 


CFP The CFP ends when the time period specified by the beacon frame expires or a CFP-EndFrame is sent After the CFP has ended a normal DCF period proceeds However since PIFS is shorter than DIFS the PC can immediately seize the medium and begin another CFP if desired While PCF was intended to provide a form of QoS to 802.11 networks it is generally agreed that it fails to provide this service adequately Although PCF gets priority over DCF since the PIFS is always less than the DIFS it suffers from the fact that individual network flows cannot be singled out for prioritization since the PC polls in a round-robin fashion High priority can be given to individual stations but affecting service on a more granular level is impossible with PCF Also polling can result in excessive overhead and large end-to-end delay when the number of stations is large 8 3 QoS IN 802.11E In an effort to give 802.11 networks true QoS 802.1 le was standardized 802.1le introduced enhancements to the existing DCF and PCF placed them under the heading of the Hybrid Coordination Function HCF The HCF is comprised of Enhanced Distributed Channel Access EDCA which is an enhanced DCF and HCF Controlled Channel Access HCCA which has many traits in common with PCF These two access methods work separately or together just as in 802.11 where DCF is mandatory and PCF is optional While the fundamentals of the original functions were not changed augmented information allows HCF to provide QoS to specific flows and/or stations EDCA In the EDCA MAC layer parameters are used to provide priority to each traffic class TC in a contention access manner similar to DCF The parameters that can be manipulated are the Arbitration Inter-Frame Space AIFS the Transmission Opportunity TxOp the CWmin and the CWmax These parameters are given default values at each station for each TC or they can be overridden by an AP using special coordination frames Each parameter creates priority in a different way The AIFS focuses on the time interval the TC must wait before trying to gain the TxOp The TxOpmax defines the length of time a station may transmit on behalf of a TC The CW parameters prioritize by adjusting the back-off counter's minimum and maximum sizes respectively Each parameter can be varied within TCs while normal DCF rules apply between TCs within a station For example each TC is maintained in a separate queue within a station and each queue contends for access to transmit on behalf of the station If the back-off timers of two TCs within a station expire at the same time the algorithm treats this as a virtual collision and will requires the lower priority flow to increment its collision counter and find a new back-off counter value In EDCA the AIFS is a time interval that is equal to or greater than the DIFS such that higher priority stations can be given low values When the AIFS expires normal DCF operation for a station continues by decrementing the backoff timer Therefore TCs with low AIFS values will be more likely to gain access to the medium Similarly the CWmin value controls the size at which each TC starts its CW A lower CWmin allows the flow to seek the medium sooner after the AIFS and to be more likely to get the medium after a collision When a collision does occur each TC multiplies the current CW by the Persistence Factor PF usually equal to 2 to calculate the next back-off timer The CWmax controls the maximum value to which a flow's CW can grow A larger value will allow the flow to be less competitive during heavy collision high load situations Lower priority flows will have larger CW values and will wait longer when network traffic is causing many collisions Finally the TxOpmax controls the length of time for which a station can transmit on behalf of each TC Larger TxOpmax values allow stations to send more frames during each use of the medium HCCA In the HCCA portion of the HCF a Hybrid Coordinator HC is used to centrally manage the medium in much the same way as PCF with the exception that HCF uses parameterized QoS Parameterized QoS refers to the use of specific information such as minimum data rate maximum latency etc that allows the HC to prioritize accordingly When acting on behalf of a new TC the station sends the HC the requirements of the TC The stations transmit these requirements in the form of Traffic Specification TSPEC frames to the HC which can accept or reject the request based on network conditions Unlike PCF the HC can poll stations during the CP which allows the HC to provide TC prioritization as well as station prioritization Similar to the relationship between DCF and PCF EDCA and HCCA are integrated within 802.1 le yet operate independently Even when HCCA is not used EDCA uses superframes with CFPs and CPs If a HC does not exist or chooses not to poll during a superframe the CP starts and EDCA rules are followed The HC's transmission is governed by the PIFS time interval and since this interval is smaller than the AIFS the HC can obtain the medium before normal stations do If the HC is active it polls stations that have indicated a need to be scheduled allows them to transmit then ends the CFP with a CF-End control frame Other 802.1 lle Enhancements The 802.1 le standard defines the HCF in order to provide specific flows and stations with high priority over others but also defines other mechanisms to indirectly aid in this 4 


goal such as Contention Free Bursts CFB Special ACKs and Direct Link Protocol DLP Under normal operation a station must contend for channel access after each TxOp This can result in low throughput for data-rate sensitive applications even in the situation where it is given priority over other stations Using CFB if there is still time left in the TxOp after a frame is transmitted the station is allowed to continue without waiting for a SIFS or the back-off counter By using CBF in conjunction with higher TxOpmax values CFB can reduce the amount of overhead and allow a high priority station that already holds the medium to achieve greater throughput The second indirect improvement is the addition of two options to the QoS control field of data frames regarding ACKs A station has the option to send packets with a flag set such that an ACK for that packet is not generated In order to increase efficiency the No Acknowledgement NOACK flag can be used for applications where ACKs are not important or do not signify any action on the part of the sender Streaming media for example can tolerate packet loss but suffers greatly in the event of high latency NOACKs in this situation improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary acknowledgement for the receiver since no retransmission attempt will be made for real-time data A second type of ACK called the BlockACK is also defined as aggregated ACKs that accumulate during a CFB An ImmediateBlockACK can be requested by the sender after a CFB and if necessary the receiver can respond with a DelayedBlockACK if the receiver cannot respond before the sender's request timeout These ACKs allow CFBs to be used effectively in an 802.1 le environment but do not directly improve prioritization Block acknowledgement has been a particularly useful feature in space communications characterized by asymmetry and capacity constraints and is utilized in several protocols standardized by the Consultative Committee on Space Data and Standards CCSDS The CCSDS File Delivery Protocol CFDP which is the space-version of the File Transfer Protocol FTP uses block acknowledgement to save bandwidth over the long-haul uplinks that are typically one order of magnitude lower in capacity than the downlinks While such asymmetry is not as significant for surface networking it is expected that the ability to control acknowledgement overhead for individual TCs will be important for capacity planning for future missions Basic 802.11 operations allow ad-hoc networking directly between stations or infrastructure-based networking where stations cannot communicate directly However in 802.1 le DLP allows networks to use both simultaneously When a station wishes to use DLP it sends a DLP request to the AP The AP forwards the request to the receiver If the receiver supports DLP it will send a response through the AP back to the sender The sender will then contact the receiver directly and begin the transmission This direct communication can be especially useful when two stations are located near each other but distantly from the AP The signal between the two stations may be stronger and could result in fewer dropped frames More importantly eliminating the extra step of going through the AP can reduce the round trip times by half and lower the load on the AP for forwarding unicast traffic The DLP feature could be very desirable for supporting local voice loops and potential video streaming between two 802.11 stations Current Status of 802 le The lack of clear market requirements for 802.11 e and additional product complexity has resulted in few vendors shipping a full 802.1 le implementation 3 In an effort to stimulate development towards full 802.1 le deployment the Wi-Fi Alliance WFA developed requirements for hardware to be Wi-Fi Multimedia WMM compliant and Wi-Fi Scheduled Multimedia WSM compliant 3 These two standards are subsets of 802.11 e that allow stations to support applications that would benefit from prioritization WMM uses EDCA while WSM uses HCF but neither includes the other enhancements discussed in the previous sections WMM uses four categories in which to place traffic voice video best effort background Each of the eight 802.1 le categories are mapped evenly to a traffic class to allow backwards support for non-WMM stations Any station sending data that is not assigned a traffic class is considered best effort traffic In this paper we refer to an 802.11b node or just a b node as an 802.1le node configured to use the standard best effort traffic class We refer to an 802.1 le node or just an e node as an 802.1 le node that has at least one of its contention parameters configured to give the station priority over a best effort node 4 PREVIOUS WORK Previous work in the area of 802.11 QoS has shown that 802.11 network parameters can be adapted to provide better overall network service to general clients by maximizing throughput based on current network conditions 6 7 It has also been shown that existing 802.11 designs allows parameter tuning such that services like VoIP can be accommodated and given some QoS guarantees 8 The fact that these approaches do not accommodate multiple priority levels or standardized parameters has lead to the development of 802.11e These developments and their relevance as the basis of an adaptive algorithm are discussed in the remainder of this section In 10 the importance of dynamic solutions to service prioritization becomes clear in the results presented It is shown that the design of 802.1 le increases the possibility of collisions and increases delay by adding an extra contention layer In normal 802.11 networks the only collisions that can occur are those between stations as they try to gain 5 


access to the medium to transmit the packet at the head of the single send queue In 802.1 le virtual collisions can occur when each TC queue must contend for access within the station's queue manager as well as real collisions when the winning queue is allowed to transmit The results in 10 show that throughput in 802.1 le is decreased and latency is increased when compared to 802.1 la networks due to this extra contention being introduced Therefore dynamic and aggressive tuning of the network parameters is required to achieve benefit from prioritization In 6 7 the authors evaluate a mechanism which allows dynamic tuning of the timing used in the back-off algorithm in 802.11 They showed that a dynamic algorithm based on the number of currently active stations which manipulates the minimum back-off time can allow a wireless network to perform closer to the theoretical capacity of the medium The algorithm estimates the current performance and adjusts its back-off accordingly Their findings show that static network parameters lead to under-utilization of the medium and show the importance of a dynamic algorithm However the network parameters are adjusted with global knowledge of the number of nodes in the network and collision rates In 9 the authors investigate two methods of choosing CWmin in 802.11 networks based on proportional fairness and time-based fairness They conclude that proportional fairness in a network based on weights provides higher throughput than time based fairness Their work shows that CWmin can be tailored to a network to provide all nodes with fair access to the medium if priority mechanisms are used and therefore it follows that the same principles can be used to provide nodes with unfair access or differentiation using contention window parameters In 4 the authors evaluate how a network with 802.1 lb and 802.1 le nodes performs with different EDCA contention parameters and how the delay and throughput are affected by these parameters The 802.1 lb nodes model background traffic while the 802.1 le nodes model high priority traffic Four different contention parameters are tested the initial size of the contention window CWmin the maximum size of the contention window CWmax the Arbitration InterFrame Spacing interval AIFS Persistence Factor PF These parameters can be adjusted to differentiate 802.1 le traffic from 802.1 lb traffic present on the same network In 4 AIFS was shown to be the most effective contention parameter for protecting high priority traffic from background traffic However the authors show that using PF and CWmin for differentiation may have the advantage of allowing for better performance of the low priority traffic The CWmin parameter can be characterized as a compromise between AIFS which is the most effective for high priority nodes and no differentiation at all which is the least adverse towards low priority nodes The work presented in 11 is similar to our research The authors use a two-level approach to fair yet prioritized service The first level of protection for high priority services guarantees that changing network conditions do not affect data streams such as VoIP and video that have constant QoS requirements By using budgeted TxOp values for each queue new flows are not allowed to have immediate access to their share of bandwidth regardless of their TC or parameter settings This ensures that established flows are not disrupted by new flows The second level of protection called Fast-Backoff with Dynamic Adjustment when Fail or Successful is the most similar to our work due to its distributed nature Under this scheme when a station experiences a transmission failure its CW is increased by a factor greater than 2 which results in a faster than exponential backoff In addition to the CW increase the station's CWmin is increased by a factor When the station experiences a transmission success CWmin is decreased by a factor and the CW is reset to CWmin This dynamic adjustment results in a dramatic decrease in the number of collisions as well as more reliable service for the voice and video data This method adjusts the EDCA parameters on all successes and all failures with no regard for direct network performance measurements The approach in 11 differs from the approach presented here in that the Adaptive Algorithm uses direct network performance measurements as opposed to using transmission successes and failures Also 11 uses the default 802.1 1e TCs under normal circumstances and does not allow fine grained performance control Finally as shown in 9 802.1 le parameters can be tuned based on network conditions to allow better performance than a single setting Although these settings are not changed dynamically in this study they do show that changing network conditions require changing parameters to use the channel efficiently In works such as 13 the HCCA is shown to be better at efficiently using the medium than pure EDCA Contention in HCCA networks is reduced since the central coordinator controls access in an organized manner Although the stations still use EDCA at the station level queues and during CPs the central coordinator controls most of the transmission opportunities Despite this result EDCA can still be considered to be an important research topic from a reliability perspective In the HCCA scheme the AP is a single point of failure If the AP fails the network will fall back on Ad-hoc mode with EDCA controlling access 5 PROBLEM STATEMENT The first set of preliminary experiments in 12 was designed to replicate the data in 4 which showed the effect each 802.11 e contention parameter has on performance when adjusted individually As found in 4 the results 6 


suggest that prioritization based on AIFS provides the best level of service for high priority traffic since in all cases it provides the lowest access times Prioritization based on CWmax provides the next best service and prioritization based on CWmin provides the least aggressive service These finding serve as the basis for parameter adjustments that are discussed in the following section Also presented in 12 is a second set of baseline experiments that were performed to further motivate the need for tighter QoS controls in 802.1 le The primary contribution of these experiments was to show that an adaptive algorithm can provide a continuum of performance levels between the static categories of TCO and TC3 and that conversely the static categories do not allow arbitrary choices of network performance It was shown that an appropriate choice of parameters could replicate the performance of the static categories as well as the performance levels in between The experiments that were shown used a simplistic and static network model Problem Statement In prior work we have shown that an earth-bound network through a high speed Ka Band isochronous connection For these simulations the speed latency and response characteristics of the connection between the LCM and the Earth is not considered in order to focus on the local communications among the 802.1lg nodes The LCM is assumed to perform an appropriate amount of buffering and error control for this type of connection Therefore this portion of the network is only shown to demonstrate the scenario context Furthermore end-to-end connections are made only between wireless stations on the lunar surface and the LCM with the LCM acting as a data warehouse and relay station All performance metrics are assumed to be between wireless stations and the LCM 54FS n s Earh K Band LCM S 4 M9bs H 54 Mb Figure 4 Simulation network structure o It is difficult to know the optimal value for the 802.1 le contention parameters o The effective performance relative to different traffic classes depends on network dynamics o Adjusting priority dynamically is possible for simple networks however more complicated networks may present greater difficulty The work presented here furthers the work presented in 12 by using a more realistic network composed of combinations of traffic and transport types intended for actual deployment in a lunar communications system The algorithm presented in this paper attempts to solve these problems by adjusting the EDCA parameters independently at each station based on a single value assigned to each data stream This single value determines the threshold for when a stream begins to adjust its parameters or in other words how aggressive the stream is in claiming access to the wireless channel The following sections explain the methods used to accomplish this goal 6 METHODOLOGY Figure 4 shows the simulated network model used in the research reported in this paper The ns2 simulator version 2.28 was used with an EDCA add-on 5 to simulate an 802.1 le network The model represents a possible scenario for lunar communications The Lunar Communications Module LCM is an access point for the 802.1 Ig nodes to The simulated lunar surface network is composed of unmanned science stations and manned vehicles The unmanned science stations transmit telemetry and standard definition SD video represented by TS in the figure The stations might also occasionally transmit high definition video represented by H in the figure Examples of manned vehicles are humans in Extra Vehicular Activity EVA suits and humans in powered vehicles Both of these human components transmit voice command and telemetry data represented by VCT in the figure Table 1 shows the Traffic Class values used in the simulations TCO represents the highest priority while TC3 represents the lowest priority TC2 is considered the default values for traffic that is unclassified Table 2 shows the traffic characteristics of the data flows used in the simulations The workloads are based on reasonable voice video and data profiles that might be used in a lunar colony The profile of G.729 VoIP traffic is modeled with a constant bit rate CBR traffic generator configured with a sending rate of 8 Kbps In addition to VoIP the VCT generates low bandwidth but high priority command data Examples of command data include instrument commands EVA suit health status or other such mission critical operational data All command data generated by a VCT is modeled as a CBR traffic generator transmitting at a data rate of 13 Kbps SD and HD video are used at manned and unmanned stations Since not all visual applications require the higher 7 


resolution of HD video SD video is the default output for unmanned monitoring stations SD video is generated from all unmanned stations using variable bit rate VBR data at 4 Mbps HD video is only generated when higher resolution is needed for a specific application at a manned station Therefore HD video is generated only at a few nodes per simulation SD and HD video profiles used were taken from the H.264/AVC standard 15 Both profiles used in this study are not intended to specifically represent an exact combination of resolution and dimension but instead could represent the following profiles SD video at 4 Mbps could represent Extended Profile Level 2.1 while HD video could represent High Profile Level 3 These profiles can describe any number of combinations of resolution and frame rate and are only approximations of video traffic that could be used in these scenarios The video traffic model incorporates and on and an off time with durations determined by a Pareto distribution During an on state the model transmits a burst of data at a configured maximum burst rate The Pareto model's mean and shape parameter were set to 1.4 an on time of 5 seconds and an off time of 1 second Table 2 Traffic T pes and Attributes Typetiu Voice Command Telemetry SD Video HD Video Protocol UDP AR-PRESET 1.5 5.0 15 35 35 Normal TC TC C TOO Priority TC0 TC1 TC2 TC3 TC3 Metrics Throughput Round Trip Throughput Throughput Throughput Jitter Time Jitter Jitter Jitter For these simulations the EDCA code was extended to allow data collection at the transport layer The main metric used to evaluate the performance of the system with the Adaptive Algorithm is the MAC access delay which is the time from a packet's entrance to the MAC queue until the time it is successfully sent Arriving packets were time stamped at queue entry and at packet transmission so that the average delays could be calculated Using the access delays a mean access delay is accumulated in between algorithm actions Using the mean access delay as a measure of algorithm performance is discussed further in 12 In addition to mean access delay which is used in the algorithm we also obtain a number of application specific performance measures in order to evaluate the network These measures include end-to-end throughput jitter Mean Opinion Score MOS and Round Trip Time RTT The metric used for each type of data is shown in Table 2 7 THE DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHM The adaptive algorithm tunes the AIFS CWmin and CWmax parameters based on the performance of the network that is measured locally using a measure referred to as the aggressiveness ratio ar The ar is the ratio of the average access delay to an estimate of the minimal access delay In other words the ar is a measure of how aggressively the data flow should adjust its parameters An ar for each flow is calculated by measuring its current performance and comparing it to the best possible performance it can hope to achieve The ar value specifies a relative performance measure of how the station is performing compared to how well it could perform if there were no other channel contention From this point forward AR PRESET refers to the target ar value that is set before the simulation for a data flow and ar refers to the aggressiveness ratio calculated for each data flow during the algorithm operation The AR-PRESET is the overall performance goal of the data flow while the ar is the measure of the progress toward that goal at a particular point in time Figure 7 shows the pseudo-code that corresponds to the algorithm discussed in the rest of the section By dynamically adjusting contention parameters while the network is operating the high priority nodes are able to maintain their quality of service under various levels of network load This dynamic quality is important since it allows configurations for any delay requirements rather than the narrow performance characteristics of TCO The algorithm presented in Figure 7 uses a single setting called the AR PRESET that can predictably provide performance on the continuum of access delays between TCO and TC2 One of the primary concerns for the algorithm is providing a way for each node to derive stateful information about the system based on local observation rather than global knowledge In the context of space communication global knowledge is to some extend easier to obtain because the communication scenarios are usually planned out in detail Typically one knows at any given time the number of active stations and the expected traffic load from each therefore optimizing the back-off algorithm based on such 8 TCP UDP UDP UDP Profile CBR CBR CBR VBR VBR Rate kbps 8 13 248 4000 12000 Packet bytes 20 1000 1000 2048 2048

Figure 9 also highlights the difficulty in designing a dynamic algorithm that is stable for most network configurations For data point 5 and 9 jitter is difficult to predict based on the AR PRESET This variability is most likely a result of the tolerance mechanism presenting artifacts during certain network configurations If the algorithm chooses too aggressively for too many data flows the contention parameters are set more aggressively and performance in the network suffers Although jitter remains better than NoDiff for all data points in Figure 9 providing more consistent behavior should be a primary goal for future versions of the AA SD Video Jitter 0.07 0.06 0.05  0.04  0.03 0.02 0.01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT and TS Nodes Figure 10 SD Video Jitter The average jitter for SD video is shown in Figure 10 This data represents a lower priority level and as compared to voice jitter in Figure 9 is able to provide better predictability The data still shows that performance for AA experiences greater variability than Normal but over most data points is better than both NoDiff and Normal HD video performance is similar to SD but has greater overall jitter and is therefore not shown Telemetry Jitter o 045 o 04 4 NoDiff Normal 0 035 AA 0 03 025 0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT Nodes 11 0.015 0.01 0.0050 Figure 11 Telemetry Jitter In Figure 11 which shows the jitter for Telemetry the data exhibits similar characteristics as the data for voice jitter Due to inconsistencies in the settling of the algorithm performance does not follow the same curve as NoDiff or Normal however for most data points the performance is better than NoDiff Figure 12 Command Round Trip Time The RTT for Command data is shown in Figure 12 Similar conclusions can be drawn from this data as have been discussed previously This data also exhibits greater variability than Normal and better overall performance than NoDiff The behavior of AA closely resembles that of AA in Figure 11 which reinforces the conclusion that the builtin hysteresis of the algorithm does not fully accommodate all network configurations Overall the Adaptive Algorithm is able to meet its goals of being a distributed way to dynamically manage priority and still perform similarly to static prioritization and better than no differentiation at all The self correcting characteristic of the algorithm leads to increased variability in performance which in some cases such as extreme network load causes the Adaptive Algorithm to perform significantly worse than static prioritization On the other hand network throughput is improved when the network is under-utilized because the Adaptive Algorithm is only engaged when performance requirements are not being met When viewed as a trade-off between simplicity of deployment and performance benefits over non-prioritized networks the Adaptive Algorithm can provide significant value to network architects and TS 


9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an extension to 802.1l e that dynamically adapts the contention parameters to meet performance requirements of lunar communications We have explored the capacity of 802.1lg using dynamic 802.1le to handle VoIP command telemetry and video according to their respective QoS requirements The data presented here shows that the Adaptive Algorithm can be deployed in these scenarios to effectively manage priority without a complicated centralized infrastructure This capability will be essential for short-range lunar communications in that quick deployment will be a primary goal The prevalence of 802.11 hardware and the possibility of the 2.4GHz band to perform at long and short ranges make it a viable option for future lunar networks However priority will be a necessity especially if the network carries non-critical traffic alongside mission-critical VoIP and data Future work on the algorithm will include improvement to the tolerance mechanism to reduce added contention from over-adjustment It is possible that more testing with more conservative settings will result in less variable network conditions at the expense of faster convergence Although we feel that the algorithm presented here is important we believe it is not the total solution It has been shown in previous works that in general 802.1 le increases contention in the network which results in overall lower throughput The Adaptive Algorithm does alleviate this disadvantage for some scenarios but not all Other works show that 802.1 le under the HCCA can solve the problem of throughput at the expense of simplicity and rapid deployment Therefore we expect that many 802.11 e deployments will use a mix of pure EDCA and HCCA in addition to using EDCA as a backup measure for HCCA Having an efficient and simple way to use ECDA will provide network architects with greater flexibility and will further reduce dependence on proprietary network design as we move towards expansion beyond the Earth 10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at Clemson University under the South Carolina Space Grant Consortium Research and Education Awards Program REAP and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 lb 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 IEEE 1999 2 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 le 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 Amendment 8 IEEE 1999 3 Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM Support for Multimedia Applications with Quality of Service in Wi-Fi Networks Wi-Fi Alliance September 1 2004 4 Swaminathan Arvind and James Martin 2006 Fairness Issues in Hybrid 802.1 lb/e Networks Consumer Communications and Networking Conference 2006 3rd IEEE Vol 1 Issue 8-10 50-54 5 Wietholter Sven and Hoene Christian 2003 Design and Verification of an IEEE 802.1 le EDCA Simulation Model in ns-2.26 TKN Technical Report Series Technical University Berlin November 2003 6 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 Dynamic Tuning of the IEEE 802.11 Protocol to Achieve a Theoretical Throughput Limit IEEE/ACM Transactions On Networking Vol 8 No 6 December 2000 785-799 7 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 IEEE 802.11 Protocol Design and Performance Evaluation of an Adaptive Backoff Mechanism IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications Vol 18 No 9 September 8 Chen D S Garg M Kappes K Trivedi 2002 Supporting VBR VoIP Traffic in IEEE 802.11 WLAN in PCF Mode Center for Advanced Computing and Communications ECE Department Duke University Durham NC Avaya Labs Research New Jersey 9 Siris Vasilios and Stamatakis George 2006 Optimal CWmin Selection for Achieving Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate 802.1 le WLANs Test-bed Implementation and Evaluation International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking WiNTECH 06 10 He Dajiang and Charles Shen 2003 Simulation Study of IEEE 802.1l e EDCA Vehicular Technology Conference Spring 2003 Vol 1 685-689 12 ILREFERENCES

C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
