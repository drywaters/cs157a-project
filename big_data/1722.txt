CDMA system is known to have some inherent advantages over other multiple accessing techniques in terrestrial wireless networks in providing various mobile communication services 1-5 Due to these advantages CDMA techniques are presently also applied to satellite systems providing wireless communication 6-7 In terrestrial systems highly linearized power amplifiers LPAs are used at the base station to avoid introduction of significant distortion into the transmitted CDMA signal This is feasible as the relatively low power efficiency of the LPAs is not very important in terrestrial systems However in the case of satellite downlinks the power 
efficiency of the high-power amplifiers HPAs is very important as the requirements on the power directly translate to the size weight and cost of the satellite payload Therefore in the case of satellite links the HPA by necessity needs to be operated in a region where significant distortion is introduced into the CDMA signal However to ensure that the communication link satisfies the required quality of service specified in terms of the probability of bit error or the probability of frame error etc it is necessary to keep the distortion caused by the HPA 
under specified limits In general higher output signal back-off in the HPA results in a lower distortion power however the attendant reduction in the HPA output signal power also reduces the signal-to-thermal noise ratio at the receiver input Thus it is highly desirable to optimize the HPA back-off to minimize the overall probability of bit error Pe resulting from the combined effect of both the HPA distortion and receiver thermal noise Such an optimization will in general depend upon the number of codes present in the CDMA signal the HPA characteristics and the downlink parameters such as 
channel characteristics and receive antenna gain determining the required transmit power for different users Thus it is of interest to determine the accurate signal-todistortion power ratio at the HPA output as a function of the output signal back-off the HPA characteristics and the number of CDMA codes and any other important parameters that must be included in the analysis In the literature the nonlinear distortion effects for the CDMA signal have been for the most part investigated using simulations 8-9 In 10 an analytic approach is described that models the CDMA signal as a nonzero mean 1 


Gaussian process and applies the extended Bussgang s theorem and related theoretical characterization for the OFDM signals developed in 11 The results are based on modeling one of the CDMA signals at the HPA input as deterministic which is then the mean of the input process while the power in the remaining code signals is treated as the variance of the Gaussian process Under such conditions it is shown that the HPA output may be expressed as the input signal multiplied by a time-varying gain plus an uncorrelated noise Such a result also requires that the power due to a single code is negligibly small compared to the total power In 10 the variance of the noise at the output is determined by taking the difference between the total output power and output signal powers and is thus based upon the signal term and the additional disturbance term Any deviation from this assumption can result in a significant error in the output SNR condition since the analysis of 10 does not provide any direct analytic expression for the power of the in-band noise component Moreover the analysis does not apply if the assumption of any single-user power being negligible compared to other users is not satisfied as is the case for very large values of M The analysis of 10 is limited to the case of equal power for all users In contrast to the previous analysis of the CDMA signal the analysis of this paper does not make the assumption of Gaussian distribution of the input CDMA signal This paper presents a direct method of analyzing the distortion effects of the power amplifier nonlinearity on the CDMA signal This approach is similar to that used in the analysis of the FDMA signals about which extensive literature exists see 12-14 and their references However there are also significant differences when such an approach is applied to the CDMA signals due to a unique property of the binaryvalued signals as detailed in this paper In the analysis approach of the paper the various user signals which are composed of data-modulated Walsh codes which are also modulated by various scrambling codes are modeled as independent random sequences These sequences are band limited using square-root raised cosine filters and modulated by a carrier frequency before being input to the nonlinear power amplifier In the paper the amplifier is modeled by a soft limiter characteristic described by an error function or any other specified function This paper derives a closed-form expression for the output signal power and the output signal power-to-distortion power spectral density ratio as a function of the input signal power back-off The expressions for both the output signal power and the output signal power-to-distortion power spectral density ratio are given in the form of infinite convergent series with its coefficients being functions of the amplifier input power level the number of codes and the amplifier transfer characteristics Alternatively the amplifier characteristics may be approximated by a polynomial of sufficiently high degree such that over the range of input signal the approximation error is negligible In an earlier paper by the author 15 for illustration of the methodology only the firstand third-degree terms are considered in the expansion These terms are enough if the amplifier is operated with sufficiently large output back-off However when the operation with relatively low back-off is considered higher-order terms are necessary to obtain accurate results This paper presents such a high-order analysis Although inclusion of many higher-order terms makes the analysis somewhat tedious the final result is in relatively simple form as is shown in the paper It may be noted that in the IM intermodulation noise analysis of the FDMA signal generally only third-order terms and at times fifth-order terms are considered adequate in the analysis 12-16 In the present application however due to the need for operating the amplifier at relatively low back-off terms on the order of forty are required to provide accurate results in that region of operation This paper also presents the output bit energy to distortion power spectral density ratio Eb Nod as a function of the input signal power back-off and as a function of the output signal power wherein the results are parameterized by the number of user signals M at the amplifier input The analysis of the paper shows that the output Eb/Nod is a strong function of M The results of the paper show that a minimum output signal back-off of about 4-5 dB is required where the output signal back-off is the output signal power relative to such power for a hard limiter with sine wave input The paper also shows that if the bit rate per user Rb is varied along with M with the total data bit rate RT at the amplifier input which is equal to M Rb held constant then the Eb/Nod does not have any significant variation with M for any output signal back-off Thus the paper shows that the amplifier possesses a maximum capacity defined as the maximum total bit rate RT that can be present at the amplifier input for a specified output signal power back-off and the required Eb/Nod ratio 2 SIGNAL MODEL AND ANALYSIS For the analysis in this paper the CDMA signal is composed of M data-modulated codes with the modulated signal filtered by a square root raised-cosine filter with roll-off factor r Because the data sequences modulating various codes are statistically independent the data-modulated signals may be modeled as statistically independent random binary sequences Thus the composite CDMA signal at the amplifier input may be modeled as Vi t  A cl t  c2 t    CM t COS\(OC t 1 where cj\(t for j  1 2 M represents the raised-cosine filtered version of the BPSK data-modulated code such that in the absence of band limiting filtering cj\(t takes values 1 or 1 Note that in the first part of the analysis it is assumed that the data modulation is BPSK however the method can be easily extended to the case of other modulation schemes including QPSK The amplifier is modeled by a memoryless nonlinearity which can be 2 


expressed in terms of its power series expansion Thus the amplifier output vo\(t may be expressed in terms of its input vi\(t by 3 2 To illustrate the analysis procedure consider first the cubic term in 2 and evaluate the signal and distortion terms contributed by this term Substitution of vi\(t from 1 in this term expanding the cos3\(cw,t in terms of cos\(cwt and cos\(3wot and retaining only the cos\(cwt term followed by the expansion of the cube of the summation of the code terms the fundamental zone term at the amplifier output contributed by the cubic term may be expressed as 3 3 M 3 M M2 V31 t  K3A l ECi t  3 E E ci t t j#i MM M  6 L L L cii\(t t t cos\(Cwct 3 i=lj=lk=1 j>ik>j Note that for the case of unfiltered signals c,\(t c2 t  1 i  1,2  I M 4a and therefore the first and second summations in 3 are actually signal components For the case of raised-cosine filtered signals 4b ch  t _ 1 i  1,2ag WM where   denotes time average With i t  c F t c t 5 then the distortion component in v31\(t may be expressed as 3 MM M v3Id t _-K3A 6 L L L ci t j t t cos\(Cw t 6 V1  i=l j=lk=l The number of terms in the three summations in 6 denoted by N1 N2 and N3 are equal to M M\(M-1 and M\(M-1 M-2 respectively In general M Nk k for any integer k  1 The table below enumerates N2 and N3 for several values of M of interest Table 1 Number of Distortion Terms M 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 N2 2 12 56 240 992 4032 16256 N3 0 4 56 560 4960 41664 341376 It is of interest to note that the number of distortion terms increases rapidly with M and that for M  8 N3 dominates N2 Thus for reasonably large values of M the distortion at the amplifier output may be approximated by V3Id Furthermore under the assumption that the various signals c,\(t are zero mean and statistically independent it follows that the various terms in the summation in 6 are uncorrelated To see this let q1\(t c1\(t t t and q2\(t c3\(t t t be two of the terms in 7 then the crosscorrelation function between q1\(t and q2\(t for any delay x is given by Rqlq2 t  q1 t t  t C t C2 t c3 t t  t c4 t  t c5 t  t 0 7 The property that the various distortion terms are uncorrelated has also been verified by simulations as shown in 15 Thus the cross-spectral density terms are zero and the power spectral density PSD of the sum is the sum of the PSDs of the individual distortion terms i.e 31d f 12\(9 2 K 2A 6 M\(M 1 M 2 P  27 K32A6 M\(M 1 M 2 f 16 3Aq f 8 where Pq\(f denotes the PSD of the individual terms c1\(t t t in the summation in 6 Similarly the terms of the type ci t t are the dominant signal terms present in v31\(t in 3 with the signal contribution due to v31\(t given by 3 M v3=s 3A 33\(M-1 Lci\(t wc t 9 4 i=1 The desired distortion power spectral density Nod is obtained by substituting f equal to zero in 8 when the contribution due to terms of order higher than 3 is disregarded This assumes that over the post code despreader bandwidth equal to the bit rate Rb the power spectral density Pq\(f is nearly constant 3 OUTPUT SIGNAL POWER TO DISTORTION TERM POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY RATIO For the case of unfiltered code signals the power spectral density of a third-order distortion term c,\(t cj\(t ck\(t is the 3 


same as the signal term c,\(t It has also been shown that even for the case of square-root raised cosine filtered case both the signal and distortion terms have the same power spectral densities These spectral densities have been obtained by simulations in 15 for the case of 1 Mcps code chip rate and are approximately equal to 58 dBW/Hz at f equal to zero For any other chip rate equal to Rem measured in Mcps the spectral density is simply normalized by R,m Thus the desired code signal power to distortion power spectral density ratio at the amplifier output is given by pS Pst Rcm N Od M Pd Pq O 0 where Pst is the total signal power obtained by summing the contributions due to terms of various degrees in the expansion in 2 similar to that obtained in 9 for the cubic nonlinearity term Pd is the total distortion power obtained by summing the contributions from terms of various orders similar to that obtained for the third-order terms in 8 except for the factor Pq\(f which is accounted for separately in 10 and R1m is the code chip rate in Mcps In 15 the result for Ps/Nod has been obtained by considering only the firstand third-degree terms in the expansion 2 applicable to the case when the amplifier operates under a relatively large output back-off In this paper the analysis is expanded to the case when an arbitrary number of terms in 2 may need to be considered as is the case when the amplifier is operated under a relatively small output back-off 4 SIGNAL POWER FROM HIGHER-ORDER ANALYSIS Following the analysis in 15 the amplifier output signal is given by r   3 1 M vos Ki41ttA  K343t3A  K545t5A5   i t cos\(cwc t i=l 1 1 where tm for j  1 3 is the coefficient of the cos\(coct term in the expansion of cosm\(coct into a sum of cosines for any odd integer m This corresponds to retaining only the terms at frequency co in the expansion of the terms vm for any integer m By definition 4 1 43 0.75 and the value of tm for any other odd integer m can be obtained by the following recursion cos m+2 0  cos m 0 cos 2\(0  a m,I Cos\(0  a m,3 cos\(30  a m m cos\(mO x 1  cos\(20 2  a m+2,1 cos\(0  a m+2,3 cos\(30   a m+2,m+2 cos\(\(m  2 12 Thus by using simple trigonometric identities for the product of two cosine terms the coefficients am 2j can be obtained in terms of am,j for any odd integer m by 14 below am+21  0.75aml  0.25am,3 am+2j 5am,j+0.25ammj-2 1<j<m j:odd am+2,m+2  0.25 am,m 13 The tm values thus computed by MATLAB for some of the values of m are listed in the table below Table 2 Coefficients em m 1 3 5 7 9 11 tm 1 0.75 0.625 0.547 0.492 0.451 In 11 the tm term for m  1 3  denotes the summation of the number of terms of various types generating the signal terms weighted by the corresponding coefficient of the term in the expansion of the mth power of the input baseband signal For example t1  1 and t3  3\(M-1 as in 9 To evaluate t5 one may observe that in the expansion of c1 c2  CM for example the signal terms are of the type ci4cj and ci2cj2ck with i  j  k The total number of terms of the type c 4cj is equal to M\(M-1 while the number of the terms of the type ci2cj2ck is equal to M\(M-1 M-2 Thus for relatively large values of M the terms of the type ci2ci2ck dominate In terms of their coefficients in the expansion the coefficient of the ci4cj type term is equal to  5 compared to the coefficient of the c 2cj2ck type term equal to 2 30 Thus both the number and coefficient of Ci2Cj2ck type terms dominate and thus t5 which is the contribution per output code signal term is equal to 14 t 5 5 M 1 M 2 2 22 Similarly in the expansion of c1 c2  cM with N 2 2 2 2k+1 the terms of the type c I c.2  c1k c k  with all indices i1 i2  ik+1 distinct are dominant The total number of such terms is equal to M\(M-1 M-k with their coefficient equal to N  Thus tN which is equal to the number of terms per code signal weighted by the their coefficients is given by N M 1 M 2 M-k  N M-1 tN  k I 2 kk 2kyk 15 4 


Substitution for tN from 15 into 11 yields the following expression for any one of the code signals at the amplifier output v-os A E Pst R cm Nod MPd Pq\(O 21 where Rem is the code chip rate in Mcps As an illustration the above analysis is applied to obtain numerical results for an amplifier with some specified inputoutput characteristics The amplifier characteristic selected for the illustration is a soft limiter model detailed below Note however that the analysis of the paper is applicable to any other input-output characteristics that are encountered in practice 6 POWER AMPLIFIER CHARACTERISTICS It is assumed that the amplifier is compensated for the AMPM conversion which will otherwise result in a phase noise in the code signals cq\(t which can be separately studied In practice this is generally the case There may also be a linearization of the AM-AM characteristics however the linearization is achievable only over a finite input power limit due to the obvious output power constraint Beyond this limit the amplifier is again saturated Thus the linearized amplifier may be modeled by limiter amplifier characteristics which can be analyzed by the approach of this paper Thus in the first instance only the AM-AM distortion is studied Two different amplifier models are considered for the analysis In the first model the amplifier is approximated by a soft limiter model with its input-output characteristic described by the following nonlinear function F\(u given by F\(u  erf\(u  2 2 U f exp\(-4  2 21 0 22 5 n X 2 K 1 J n 1  2 x n odd M E ci t cos\(ic t i=l 16 With Pi MA2/2 denoting the amplifier input power and substituting n  2j+1 the signal term may be rewritten as wh=A K2j 1 3ci\(t ot 17a where rlo  1 II i  1 1 1J  O  j  M 17b and where jm+l denotes the number of significant terms in the summation Thus the total signal power Pst at the amplifier output may be approximated as PStPI rE K2j+12j+1 2;j  Pi 18 5 POWER IN HIGHER-ORDER DISTORTION TERMS Considering the expansion of c1 C2+...+cm among the various distortion terms that are present are the terms of the type c.2cjckcl and cicjckclcm with all the indices i j k 1 and m distinct The number of terms of the first type is equal to M\(M-1 M-2 M-3 whereas the number of terms of the second type is equal to M\(M-1 M-2 M-3 M-4 Thus for relatively large M the number of the second type is dominant A similar result is also known to apply to the FDMA signal analysis The coefficients of these two types of terms are equal to 5!/2 and 5 respectively Thus the contribution due to the terms of the type cicjckclcm is dominant Ignoring other distortion terms will thus provide a tight lower bound to the total distortion power at the amplifier output In the same manner the number of dominant terms in the expansion of c1 c2 c+M is equal to tn   with the coefficient of each such term n equal to n for any odd integer n Thus the total distortion power at the amplifier output may be approximated as  2E 2 1M n A 19 2 n=3 nodd Substituting P1 MA2 2 and n  2k-1 the expression for Pd may be written in the following equivalent form 1 22k1 Pd  E K2kI 12k-1[\(2k-l 2k-2 2Pi 20 2k where q for any integer j is defined above in 1 8b Approximating the PSD of each of the distortion terms at zero frequency by Pq\(O the Ps/Nod is given by 10 which is reproduced by Ps

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
