Firstly, the paper introduces the concept of access pattern according to a user  s access path, and secondly puts forward a revised algorithm\(FAP-Mining based on the FP-tree algorithm to mine fiequent access patterns. The new algorithm first constructs a fiequent access pattern tree and then mines users  frequent access patterns on the tree. What  s more, the algorithm is accurate and scalable for mining frequent access patterns with diferent lengths 1. Introduction Today Web Mining is one of the popular issues in data mining. Web Mining can be broadly defined as the discovery and analysis of useful information from the World Wide Web. [ I ]  In terms of its research domains, web mining can be divided into three branches: Web Content Mining, Web Structure Mining and Web Usage Mining Web content mining describes the discovery of us information from the web content/data/documents   web content encompasses a broad rang of data such as text image, audio, video-.. . Web structure mining is the process of discovering knowledge from the World Wide Web organization and links across the webs. Web usage mining is the process of extracting interesting patterns or knowledge from various web access log records  During the process of web usage mining, The rules and patterns in web log records are explored and analyzed mainly by means of these techniques relating to artificial intelligence, data mining, database theory and so on. In general, web usage mining consists of three phases namely data preprocessing, pattern discovery and pattern analysis, shown in Figure l-lL3]. The main purpose of data preprocessing is to extract useful data from raw web log and then to map these data into the abstract data form necessary for pattern discovery; Pattern discovery finds out various rules and patterns, taking advantage of all sorts of data mining techniques such as statistics analysis association rule analysis, classification, clustering, and sequential pattern analysis and so on; Pattern analysis filters out the  useless  rules discovered in the period of pattern discovery, and then extracts the  interesting  rules and patterns for the end users In this paper, mining web access log records discovers different access patterns of different users. In this way, web designers and maintainers can easily improve the link structure of web pages, enhance web server performance and provide characteristic service for customers. For example, corporations that deal with e-commerce can use this method to optimize customer strategy, discover target customers, and let all kinds of customers realize their excellent and characteristic services Consequently the mining of the web user access pattern can be applied into many industries widely Preprocessing Pattern Discovery Pattern Analysis Raw Files Log 7 s e ; ; Z . s F  and Rules, Statistics Patterns  f?teresting  Patterns and  Rules, Statistics Figure 1-1.

Problem Description User access pattern is the concept based on user access path, which is an important sequential pattern in web usage mining. After preprocessing web server log data, we can get user access paths from user session files. F i p 2 - 1 shows the user's\(Uidl accesses certain web site: A-B-C-D-B-G-E H-G-C-A-1-K-1-D Figure 2-1. the User's\(Uid The link structure between web pages can be mapped into a directed graph: Sitemap=\(N, E p,, ..., p,}\(n=1,2 the web site, 1 INI\(=n E={&lt;pl, p2&gt;, &lt;p4, p7&gt;, .--, &lt;p,, pJ&gt;, -.} denotes the set of all the hyperlinks of all pages of the web site. &lt;p,, pj&gt denotes that there is a hyperlink from page p, to pJ, i#j, 1 d i ,  j&lt;n Definition 1.

In Figure 2-1, \(Uidl, {A, B, C, D one of the Uidl's access pattern The difference between user access pattern definited here and user access path is that access pattern is always the forward reference of access path, whereas user access path includes forward and backward references of web pages. For instance, the access path of page H shown in Figure 2-1 is A-B-C-D-B-G-E-H, whereas the corresponding access pattern is APH=\(Uidl, {A, B, G, E H browsing behavior more simply and clearly than access path and it facilitates the analysis and mining of users access laws as well Definition 2. xE N, that duple AP=\(userid, {x called userid's meta-access pattern Example 2.

FAP-Ming Algorithm FP-gr~wth[~] is an algorithm with good functionality when it is used in mining association rules and sequential patterns. There is no sequence among those elements of an item during mining association rules, whereas access pattern mining requires sequential page access. Thus the Fp-growth has to be revised before applied to mining user frequent access pattern. In this paper, the new algorithm is called Frequent Access Pattern Mining \(FAP-Mining FAP-Mining is divided into two steps. Section 3.1 is Step One, which constructs frequent access pattern tree \(FAP tree files, and records the access counts of each page. Section 3.2 is Step Two, where the function of FAP-growth is used to mine both long and short access patterns on the FAP tree 3.1. The Construction of FAP-Tree Algorithm: FAP_Tree\(tree, p Input: The set of user access path p Output: The set of use access pattern Procedure FAP-Tree\(T, p  access tree create-tree\(T Construct the root of FAP-Tree signed with  null   while pOnil  do if p.name is the same as the name of T  s ancestor \(n n.count:=n.count+ 1 T:=n I else c if p m m e  is the same as the name of T  s child\(c c. count :=c.count+ 1 T:=c I else insert-tree\(T, p insert the new node of p into T, as a child of the current node  p:=p.next 1 1 In order to facilitate frequent access pattern generation and FAP tree traversal, a page header table ascending on access counts of each page is built so that each page points to its occurrence in the tree via ,a chain of node-link. Table 3-1 shows an episode of access path of 


node-link. Table 3-1 shows an episode of access path of certain user contained in the user session file. According to access paths in Table 3-1, the function of FAP-Tree constructs frequent access tree shown in Figure 3-1 D: 1 Figure 3-1. FAP Tree 767 Table 3-1. An Episode of U s e r  Access Paths in Users Session Files B Userid Userid Userid Userid I UserName I Sessionblame I Awess Path I s1 s2 A-B-C-D--C-B-E-G-E-C s3 A-B-A-C-I s4 C-1-G-1-K-1-D A -B -.C - D-B - E 3.2. FAP-growth The mining of FAP tree proceeds as follow. At first according to the access counts of each page-node in FAP tree, the function of FAP-growth generates each length-1 frequent access pattern \(as an initial suffix constructs its prefix pattern base, and finally builds a longer access pattern by every prefix pattern base connecting with its suffix. If the longer access pattern satisfies the min-sup, it becomes a new frequent access pattern The FAP-growth executes the procedure until all frequent length-1 access patterns have been done. In short the FAP-growth method transforms the problem of mining long frequent access pattern to searching for shorter ones as initial s a ixes Algorithm: FAP-gowth\(tree, a pattern Input: FAP tree, min_sup=2\(the minimal acces., 4- count that satisfies the support threshold Output: the set of all the access patterns: a Procedure FAP-growth\(tree, a  for each a, .count&gt;,min-sup a, is a member of the page header table    generate access pattern p = a a:=a U p p:=a, .next p points to the first location of a, in the FAP tree while \(pfnull p.countbmin-sup  look for each a  s prefix access pattern base then construct access pattern /3, by a  s prefuc access pattern base connecting with itself if p ,  3 min-sup then a:=a u p p:=p.next p points to the next location of ai in the FAP 1 tree 1 1 The mining of the FAP tree shown in Figure 3-1 is summarized in Table 3-2. And for the page-node D i n  the page headler table as an example, we illustrate the mning process of FAP-growth \(tree, a 1 access pattern p =\(Userid, {D 2 D.next page-node: D in the FAP tree that lies in the branch of A B-C-D 3 2  s

Then the function will do with the next page-node in the page head table after the page-node D have been done 4. Conclusion The mining of frequent access pattern from user  s browsing web behaviors is worth applying, to many fields such as the design and maintenance of web site e-commence and education-. The FAP-]Mining method proposed in this paper is feasible by extracting users   access patterns from users  access paths of certain web site If being improved, this method would be widely applied to many fields. Next, we will use a large number of data to 768 t e s t e  the functionality of this method, and make further exploration on the analysis of association rule and access pattern among users  browsing behaviors G D E Table 3-2. the Mining Result of the FAP Tree I a, I Set of Prefix Access Pattern Base 1 Frequent access pattern generatedwser name omitted I {G}:2 C}:3, {B,C}:3, {A,B,C}:3} {D}:2, {C,D}:2, {B,C,D}:2, {A,B,C,D}:2 B}:5, {A,B}:4 {E}:3, {B,E}:3, fA,B,E}:3 I B I A l  {I 1 {A} :4 C}:l {I}:3 A}:4 {B}:5, {A,B}:4 C {B}:5, {A,l3}:4 {C}:3, {B,C}:3, {A,B,C}:3 I 5.

starting partitions \(start in Table 2  Processing of P2. The weighted count threshold for P2 is m2 = 0.4  3  0.67 = 0.804. The accumulative weighted count threshold from partition P1 to partition P2 is 0.804 + 0.804 = 1.608. We ?nd that 5 new 2-itemsets, AB, AF , BE, BF , and EF in P2 have weighted counts greater than m2, so they are added to C2. Furthermore, the old itemsets AD, AE, DE, and DF have their accumulative weighted counts greater than 1.608. Therefore, they are retained in C2. The information kept after processing P2 is shown in the left part of Table 3 P2 P3 itemset start count itemset start count AB 2 1.34 AB 2 1.87 AD 1 2.01 AD 1 3.61 AE 1 2.68 AE 1 3.21 AF 2 1.34 AF 2 2.94 BE 2 1.34 BF 2 2.54 BF 2 2.01 DE 1 2.54 DE 1 2.01 DF 1 3.61 DF 1 2.01 EF 2 1.87 EF 2 1.34 Table 3. Candidate 2-itemsets generated after scanning partition P2 and P3, respectively  Processing of P3. The weighted count threshold for P3 is 0.4  3  0.536 = 0.643. All new 2-itemsets generated in P3 have weighted counts less than 0.643. The itemsets generated in P1 all have accumulative weighted counts greater than 2.25 and the itemsets generated in P2, except BE, have accumulative weighted counts greater than 1.45, so they are retained in C2 and BE is deleted from C2. The resulting candidate 2-itemsets after processing P3 are shown in the right part of Table 3 Therefore, we have C2 = {AB,AD,AE,AF,BF,DE,DF,EF C3 = {ABF,ADE,ADF,AEF,DEF C4 = {ADEF Ck = ?, k ? 5 By scanning D once, we have the sets of frequent kitemsets, Lk, k ? 2, of D along with their counts to be L2 = {\(AD, 3.61 AE, 3.21 AF, 3.61 BF, 3.21 DE, 2.54 DF, 3.61 EF, 2.54 L3 = {\(ADE, 2.54 ADF, 2.94 AEF, 2.54 Lk = ?, k ? 4 and L = L2?L3. The association rules can then be obtained from the frequent itemsets in L 4. Experimental Results In this section, experimental results obtained with a PC with AMD Athlon XP CPU and 1.0G memory are presented 4.1. Experiment 1 In this experiment, we compare our fuzzy calendar algebra with the calendar algebra proposed in [16]. The Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  TIME  04 1530-1311/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE Figure 4. Performance comparison between the calendar algebra and our fuzzy calendar algebra with a simple calendar calendar algebra de?nes operators such as dicing, slicing, and ?atten to construct complex calendars. The time intervals are obtained from a speci?ed calendar and the calendric association rules are discovered in these time intervals. For a complex calendar, the calendar algebra decomposes the calendar into basic ones 


endar algebra decomposes the calendar into basic ones and then the time intervals of each basic calendar are separately searched. This approach is not e?cient since one time interval may be searched with several di?erent basic calendars. On the contrary, our fuzzy calendar algebra checks each time interval only once and can easily ?nd out all the time intervals in a given calendar. Repetitive and unnecessary searches in a time interval can be avoided, and the performance is improved We use 1825 time intervals collected in 5 years, with each time interval representing one day in a year. The execution time for ?nding out the desired time intervals by the calendar algebra and the fuzzy calendar algebra, respectively, is shown in Figure 4. The calendar algebra searches each time interval twice while the fuzzy calendar algebra searches each time interval only once, and thus we can clearly see that our method is more e?cient in interpreting calendars. For more complicated calendars, i.e., containing more basic calendars, our fuzzy calendar algebra performs even better as shown in Figure 5 4.2. Experiment 2 In this experiment, we  d like to show the e?ectiveness of our strategy for mining fuzzy temporal patterns. The number of candidates and frequent itemsets discovered are reported. The execution time for discovering the itemsets is also presented. The dataset Figure 5.

The dataset is partitioned into 200 partitions and there are 500 transactions in each partition. To infer from these partitions with our fuzzy calendar algebra, we assume the ?rst partition being the time interval of 2003/01/01, the second partition being of 2003/01/02, . . . , and so on. The calendar we are interested in is the one given in Eq.\(6 ber of candidates and frequent itemsets discovered are given in Table 4 and the execution time for discovering these itemsets is shown in Figure 6. From Table 4 and Figure 6, proper numbers of frequent itemsets can be discovered in acceptable time with our method 5. Conclusion We have presented the fuzzy calendar algebra which supports fuzzy queries on calendars.

Execution time with di?erent support thresholds are natural and easy for use in the sense that they capture the way in which human beings reason with time requirements. To accommodate temporal expressions with multiple time granularities, ?ve operations, and 


with multiple time granularities, ?ve operations, and or, not, xor, and sub, are introduced We have shown the usefulness of the fuzzy calendar algebra by incorporating it with PWM to mine fuzzy temporal association rules from temporal databases Firstly, the transactions of the database are divided into a sequence of partitions. Then the weight of each partition is inferred, denoting the matching degree of the corresponding time period to the fuzzy calendar speci?ed in the user  s queries. Temporal patterns in the divided time periods of di?erent matching degrees are then e?ciently produced, and the number of database scans can be e?ectively reduced. Experimental results have shown that this approach of ?nding fuzzy temporal association rules is very e?ective References 1] R. Agrawal and R. Srikant. Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
