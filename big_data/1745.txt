numerous sources Its applications can be found in a variety of technology settings from robotics structural and vehicle health monitoring to communications space science and telemedicine This work is a canonical overview of several major fusion architectures developed from the remote sensing and defense community We present several types of architecture for managing multi-sensor data fusion specifically as they relate to the tracking-correlation function and blackboard processing representations in knowledge 
engineering Object-Process Methods are used to model the information fusion process and supporting subsystems Finally we discuss the importance of fusion to the concept and operation of the Semantic Web Semantic networks offer powerful ways to exploit the synergy of multi-sensor data platforms Their operation is based on synthesis of fusion with ontology models for knowledge representation We discuss the importance of fusion as a reuse process in ontological engineering and 
review key lifecycle models in ontology development The evolutionary approach to ontology development is considered the most useful and adaptable to the complexities of semantic networks Several potential applications for data fusion are screened and ranked according to the Joint Directors of Laboratories JDL process model for information fusion Based on these predetermined criteria the case of medical diagnostic imaging was found to offer the most promising applications for fusion on which future

applications technologies and communities of interest It refers in a broad sense to the processing and distribution of data from two or more sources to obtain a property of an environment or object Common sensor devices include video cameras range finders tactile sensors and sonar Environments may include oceanic or terrestrial surfaces airborne or ground-based combat zones warehouse facilities and web-based retail e.g Fig.1-1 The list of stakeholders grows as new forms of sensors are 
developed and applied to data-rich environments The following definitions are culled from the remote sensing community where fusion concepts and nomenclature have been matured over several decades Image fusion is the combination of two or more different images to form a new image by using a certain algorithm Pohl and Van Genderen 1998 Techniques which combine data from multiple sensors and related information from associated databases to 
achieve improved accuracy and more specific inferences than could be achieved by the use of a single sensor alone Hall and Llinas 1990 A multilevel multifacetedprocess dealing with the automatic detection association correlation estimation and combination of data and information from multiple sources  US Department ofDefense 1991 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 C 2008

r t  CLASSIFICATION There are significant limitations due to single sensors that should be mentioned For instance weather clutter and noise may interfere with the recognition of an object by a single sensor system A key determinant to the success of a single sensor system is the orientation of the mission and 2 NOISE SOURCES ENTITY to Emissions sensor DETECTION F[E t conversion to  ESTIMATION observation Figure 1-1 Data fusion example Image Superposition from 3 data sources Systems Engineering Context Steinberg identified three systems engineering challenges in data fusion 1 Firstly how should uncertainty be modeled both in sensory observations and in the phenomenon which produce those observations Secondly how should systems aggregate non-commensurate sensory data i.e imagery text and signals Finally how should multiple observations under singleand multi-source conditions be correlated processed and maintained Steinberg elaborates on the notion of data visibility with an analogy to resource management Both resource management and data fusion rely on a certain level of granularity for effect The former technique results in action the latter in estimation As sensor design is pushed beyond conventional measures of estimation so too will the expected impact of fusion data It is thus critical that the synergies between data fusion and neighboring domains be leveraged At its core data fusion is an information-theoretic process enabled through hardware and software products and systems Subjects such as quality assurance and risk assessment are less developed in the information domain relative to traditional hardware fields like aerospace or nuclear engineering This provides a unique opportunity for the practitioner community to extend the Data Fusion knowledge base and taxonomy across all phases of system engineering When held to similar notions of reliability and utility as mechanical components sensor data might codify a more holistic framework for specifying product requirements or mission objectives 2 SENSORS AND SENSOR PLATFORMS The value of data fusion lies in the breadth of sensor categories available to the designer The traditional applications normally cull these sensors from the electromagnetic spectrum For instance in data fusion through remote sensing electro-magnetic energy reflected or emitted from objects is measured and reported However the energy from acoustic ultrasonic magnetic and seismic waves all offer potentially rich sources of information on which to design fusion system architectures Single Sensor Systems A sensor is comprised of a transducer which converts energy entering an aperture into lower frequencies from which targets and background information may be discerned through a data processor Digital sensors actuators and low power RF radios all help to enable the functionality of a single sensor system NSF Directorate for Computer and information Science and Engineering through integration of a single chip in a processor's memory Figure 2-1 illustrates the basic components of a typical sensor system Examples of sensor apertures include antennas for RF energy optics for IR-UV-visible light energy and microphones/hydrophones for acoustical energy Figure 2-1 A sensor system adapted from Waltz and Llinas 1990  Additive noise DETECTION  Signal dispersion PHENOMENON E t  Multiple paths MEDIUM TRANSMISSION OR EVENT airplane  s  


whether there are sufficient data processing resources that are localized in each sensor 2 Multi-sensor systems Multi-sensor systems offer numerous advantages over single sensors when it comes to the fundamental tasks of utilizing and delivering information toward a specific objective For instance Landsat1 the first earth observation satellite launched in 1972 was a historical program designed to obtain information on agricultural and forestry resources geology and mineral resources hydrology pollution oceanography and marine resources among other objectives The system acquired visible light and near infrared earth photos as well as radiometric Earth images through a multi-sensor vidicon and multi-spectral scanner The data was processed and stored in wide-band video tape recorders which offered near-global coverage capability3 The combination of microwave millimeter wave infrared and visible sensors has also been used in daily weather forecasting Furthermore the collection of ground-based and aerial sensor data has been useful for characterizing the targets which are being imaged by these sensors Active versus Passive Sensors Sensors are often classified as either active or passive depending on their signal conditioning An active sensor requires external sources of excitation while passive sensors generate their own electrical output without requiring external voltages or currents The need then for external active circuitry to produce electrical output signals from the sensor determine whether structurally a sensor should be classified as active or passive In the microwave spectrum these definitions take on a slightly different meaning Active microwave sensors provide their own source of radiation to illuminate a target as in RADAR imaging They use radio waves to detect objects and determine their position range or shape Active sensors tend to provide more information than passive sensors at the cost of increased power consumption and interference when other active sensors are in operation and easier detectability of the sensor For instance active MMW radars operate in mono-static and bi-static configurations In the former the transmitter and receiver are collocated on the same platform so that the receiver processes energy that is backscattered from objects in the field of view FOV In the bi-static mode the transmitter and receiver are spatially disconnected reducing the type and versatility of applications Passive microwave sensors record energy emitted by the atmosphere or surface reflected by the surface or transmitted from the subsurface Another example of a purely passive sensor is an electro-optical sensor which in 3 Retrieved from Wikipedia.com military applications can offer stealthy non-detectable operation Since passive sensors depend on naturally occurring energy they are limited in the location and timing of their operation For instance the amount of solar radiation at polar latitudes is insufficient for visible light sensors during the polar night and limits the use of passive detectors to low latitudes The Thematic Mapper on Landsat satellites is an important exception to this design limitation as it taps into seven different sensor bands These bands are sensitive to numerous ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum from the visible to thermal infrared portions of the spectrum The Landsat is therefore launched at strategic times to ensure that the satellite will make passes during optimal periods of solar radiation sunsynchronous orbits Sensor Platforms A sensor platform is a vehicle or system used to carry the sensor Example platforms are shown in Figure 2-2 Typical sensor platforms in the C4ISR arena include satellites and aircraft manned or unmanned but can also include balloon kits for low-level surveillance remote sensing ladder trucks and a host of other mobile or stationary devices The fundamental selection factor is the altitude that determines the ground resolution in turn sets the IFOV Instantaneous field of view of the sensor on board4 Figure 2-2 a Wireless Reconfigurable Platform Ground-based sensors offer some cost advantages in terms of maintenance and operation compared to aerial platforms They can be placed on structures in buildings towers or on board terrain vehicles The complexity and maintenance of the ground-based sensor is dependent on the design involved For instance highly complex phased array antennas are ground-based sensors with thousands of apertures array elements see Figure 2-2 b The advent of AESA Active Electronically Steered Arrays has replaced 3 Retrieved from The GIS Development Portal 3

The Semantic Web in the words of Tim Berners Lee Chair Worldwide Web Consortium is the application of weblike design to data Its structure will foster environments where software agents more efficiently and form more all the more challenging to ascertain when the ontology is complete Figure 3-1 Lifecycle Development Models Life 7r tiort}h no predetermined metric of quality it is more flexible by allowing the designer to return to any component at use that metadata to enhance processing in a specific ontology The machine analogy made by Berners-Lee is applicable here if there is any point in time But because there is mean for the data generated in source ontologies require periodic updating in order to refresh the cycle of evolution which takes place Fusion as a Re-use Process Ontology an allocated domain space Finally the third stage of concept evolution in the Semantic Web relates to the notion of metadata processing That is an evolving prototype lifecycle Figure 3-1 5 It requires constant iteration within and between the fundamental steps in development namely specification conceptualization formalization implementation and maintenance The evolving lifecycle for ontology is different from the sequential waterfall approach can pick up data on the fly and then or strings 2 Universal Resource Identifiers URIs identify the or improvements but rather unique ontologies that have been developed from similar subject material In composition/integration ontologies are used for concepts 1 numbers source ontologies from the new applications to be defined same thing in all contexts and 3 dereferencable URIs What does this evolution same subject These prrduct NV4teMl lRerafive Evolvinxg Ontologies must confer both structure and flexibility in order for the Semantic Web to function They can be used to enhance web searches based on precise rather than ambiguous concepts But they also must tailor to the decentralized nature of the web and web services For this aseangement to work we propose that a knowledge representation system has a degree of hierarchy to it The syntactic problems have begun to be addressed in developing the web through Semantic Web Language SWL Formal ontologies and models for their development can play an important role in resolving the semantic issues i.e giving names to the basic concepts of the data and writing rules to take advantage of their connections In managing this process the are not revisions are two commonly accepted modes of so that computers so that friendly a semantic web machine then it is a proof validator not a theorem prover For instance a priori and posterior data to validate observations not to prove particular theories 5 Retrieved from Scientific American.com 2001 The Ontological Lifecycle The development of ontology follows a priori planning in iterative development It is inherently a common way to propagate the knowledge gained in various fields without having to reinvent the wheel There reuse in ontological engineering fusion/merging and composition/integration 5 In fusion re-use the ontology is built by bringing together knowledge from different new associations In his stack of specifications Berners-Lee talks about three stages of evolution in the identifiers which can be received and integrated to on binary vector string data for instance IFFN sensors Indeed the profile of missions is increasingly complicated with multi-objective multi-source data that needs to be interwoven in context behavioral and directly measured features Secondly URI protocols enable roam from page to page to readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users."5 The Semantic web adds identification tags to information and then links them can discover data a complex C4ISR system Firstly it highlights the inadequacy of single sensor systems that might only call source data an automated agent sensor data should be validated using a combination of or the re-use is are built through assembling source modules from various subjects This is appropriate when ontologies have gone through extensive modification adaptation or specialization over time 5 Discrimination Anti Submarine Warfare Categories ASW Mission Directly  Acoustic signatures Measured Features  Magnetic signatures  Diesel fume spectra  Bio-nuclear effects Behavioral  Speed Characteristics  Sustained speed  Depth  Maneuverability  Hostile act Context Information  Origin of mission  Location relative to friendly vessels 


Lucien Wald 8 has developed terms of reference in data fusion that can be repurposed toward various fusion ontologies Wald derives most of his terms from the remote sensing and defense system applications but we will demonstrate their extension to other fields through domain goal-based and mathematical reasoning The ObjectProcess Diagram OPD is an explicit representation of the semantic decomposition of these terms for generalized fusion Its overarching premise is the treatment and origins of raw information which can take several forms from measurement and signal to observations and verbal reports The relational links that constitute the OPD is given in Figure 3-2 Figure 3-2 Relational links in OPD 0 sa is the same as A code surrogate address of symbol for Decomposes to aggregates to i.k is characterized by exhibits A eSpecializes to generalizes to i instantiated to belongs to the class of Although fusion is the central process in Figure 3-3 it is helpful to include aspects of the supporting system as well as supporting processes which act on the information It is worth noting that there are many types of raw information which can be refined over various processes and environments The hardware elements of the supporting system have been simplified to represent a simple sensor arrangement In reality complex fusion systems are comprised of multiple distributed platforms with thousands of apertures and waveforms Similarly there are many more supporting processes which enable data fusion these hierarchical classification schemes will be discussed later Figure 3-3 Object-Process Diagram for Information Fusion Parallelism and other Taxonomies Rule-based analytics in knowledge-based systems KBS have benefited tremendously from the advent of parallel computers For instance the rules highlighted in Figure 34 under supporting processes can be subjected to rule-level partitioning where classes such as correlation combination or association rules are generated Class-based rule partitioning forms another aspect of ontology development namely one based on fusion algorithm Whereas the Object-Process Diagram above took an information-based approach to ontology design the class methods utilize a hierarchical scheme which imparts a specific decompositional logic or organization Hall develops taxonomy for level 1 processing that is extensible to other levels of fusion This is derived from algorithmsboth statistical and heuristicwhich are based on level 1 fusion object identification Level 1 is specialized into 3 classes positional identity and ancillary support algorithms These are further decomposed by technique or method Positional fusion for instance involves parametric association and estimation of data Identity fusion uses physical models cognitive models and feature-based inference Ancillary support systems which often comprise more than 80 of the fusion effort include numerical libraries data alignment preprocessing database management and man/machine interfaces These are only one instance of a larger class of items 6

p is a polarity or truth-value Real and abstract situations can be distinguished by their polarity A real situation is a set of facts with polarity equal to 1 10 Figure 4-1 illustrates Bowman's cognitive model for a perceptual reasoning machine PRM based on the concept of reinforcement learning Figure 4-1 Perceptual Reasoning Machine PRM for Cognition  Situational Awareness Reinforcement Perceptual Reasoning Cycle each sensor's signal is specific to the transducer design Since discrimination among targets occurs locally before data entry it reduces the load on the fusion processor 2 The next step in concept selection is known as the downselect phase During down-select potential applications are screened according to their fit with the JDL processing criteria This method was developed by Stuart Pugh in the 1980's and helps design teams to decide on optimal strategies for their product goals A Pugh concept selection matrix is provided in the Appendix It ranks applications based on the processing requirements of the data Tracker-Correlator Architectures There are currently 3 general synthetic architectures for data processing which exist today centralized decentralized autonomous and hybrid architectures Refer to Figures 42 through 4-4 11 Figure 4-2 Centralized Fusion Architecture A CENTRALIZED FUSION I Decliralonri The advanced combat direction system ACDS is an example of the centralized fusion architecture 9 The system has external interfaces with existing sensors which maintain different reporting protocols and data links Acoustic IFF ESM and Radar send sensor-level tracks and target reports to the track management processor indicated by the dashed line in Figure 4-2 These reports are fed into the ACDS database which contains tactical status intelligence maps doctrine and tracks Each track-to-track association or identification from the arrival of new observations requires retrieval of the data from a central decision support processor not shown The common thread underlying these location-driven architectures is the notion of a progressive data flow from sensor set A B N through detection classification and end-state Under the centralized scheme the preprocessed output is collected into the data alignment  association through coordination transformation Raw data from a multi-target environment is correlated and then transmitted to the central processing facility A variant of this type of fusion is centralized fusion of feature vector data This construct drives ambiguity out of the system by extracting feature vectors from an image The feature-based method is 8 enarS t Constols The closed loop PRM provides situational feedback to a human perceptual system which optimizes the decisionmaking process This is viewed as a meta-level information management system for resource control that continuously updates domain knowledge as it is acquired Process Selection Comparing Fusion Levels The table in the Appendix sets forth criteria that can be used in selecting a fusion level for a given application These characteristics form part of the selection process that can be used in screening for an appropriate concept The table is divided among four levels of data that approximately correspond to the JDL fusion levels The criteria are based on the type of sensory information being generated individual signals images features etc The table goes on to characterize the content of such information The degree and means of registration are also important factors as the spatial position of sensors determines their ultimate footprint and target-detection space Overlapping footprints ensure that time-dependent phenomena such as a target motion are observed by all sensors at the same time The criteria in Table A can then be used to select the type of architecture which factor into the fusion system design i.e central or sensor-level processing The main difference between these two is that the former processes sensor reports directly and in one place requiring a more complex fusion processor This helps to achieve better accuracy when the multi-sensor data is not generated by independent phenomena Sensor-level fusion is preferred when the signatures are independent There is more cueing of sensors with others in the suite where the optimization of NIIyotk*wwufic  im n

they are a useful construct for exploratory research and incremental development of a problem Finally hierarchical decompositions help deal with the problem of complexity in mission design by reducing the number of activities through progressive levels of detail Objectoriented representations in action decomposition are stored in plan librariesor databasesthat can be accessed to fit the needs of the mission However hierarchical methods such as blackboard architectures do not always decompose problems correctly In artificial intelligence Al the inability to capture everything in a set of logical rules is known as the qualification problem 13 Consequently blackboard architectures can be expensive to build modify and operate 5 APPLICATIONS Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence Surveillance  Reconnaissance systems C4ISR provide mature highly evolved examples of data fusion but they are not the only systems which make use of data fusion concepts The objective of a C4ISR system is to provide a comprehensive view of the tactical and strategic battle space through a variety of technologyand intelligence-based media The systems are composed of software hardware and human elements which work in concert to support decision-making processes Fulfillment of C4ISR objectives draws heavily on the utilization of sensor data Increasingly fusion design needs to account for the transition from platform-based systems to networkcentric operations Sense  Respond Logistics SRL Sense  Respond is an emerging domain in military and commercial logistics with powerful implications for the fusion paradigm It is a managerial framework that was originally proposed by researchers at IBM 13 based on the dynamic of change in business security and technology It is comprised of a value net of self-synchronizing partnerships which form and dissolve to adapt to demands in the environment Elements of this value net have been evolved specifically the triumvirate known as operational logistics and intelligence command for military and defense scenarios SRL almost mirrors the data fusion process itself by observing patterns detecting issues and performing root-cause analysis Finally data fusion in robotics plays an important role in factory automation processes such as material handling part fabrication and assembly This can appear in the form of cooperative systems dexterous hands and tele-operation for mining and manufacturing Biometrics Biometrics offers interesting case applications of data fusion principles Biometrics are used in the security or identification sectors where the systems draws on an attribute database to make comparisons and declarations about ownership or identity This is characterized by a subset of the processes used in the JDL model of data fusion object identification collection collation and evaluation The final stage of processing uses relatively simple decision rules to either accept or reject the user based on the attribute data on record Space Expeditions The Haughton-Mars expedition to the Canadian Arctic conducted by MIT in 2005 synthesizes some of these and other considerations in a complex data fusion system design Among other objectives the team set out to determine the efficacy of RFID technology for intelligent agent and asset tracking in support of exploration logistics 14 The International Space Station ISS is currently dominated by manual tracking and barcodes so the hypothesis was that automated web-accessible systems could offer potential savings in time and effort for inventory management Though the concept of RFID tagging was simple it led to complications with respect to optimal antenna installation and tracking of liquids and metallic items The system was equipped with both passive battery-run and active tagging leading to interference in the 915 MHz and 2450 MHz bands This implied that the range data could be reliable under more powerful strictly active RF sensors This would of course require the proper level of EMI shielding of the agents containers and ATVs being tracked In a separate part of the experiment the team developed functional Class of Supply COS ontologies to supplement the Cargo Category Allocations Rates Table CCART used by NASA as well as supply classifications used by NATO and the US Military This was borne out of the need to capture all major items for the new space exploration initiative not already listed in the CCART such as categories for propellant fuels and surface transportation vehicles needed for remote science stations Dynamically indexing these remote logistics categories to a generic upper level ontology that is web-enabled could vastly improve the tracking operation The sensor data being fused could help teams to not only make operational adjustments to the expedition for instance regarding ATV usage but also improve the quality and relevance of the experiments For instance an asset library that is hyperlinked to the web could inform agents of similar expeditions with results/findings openly accessible to the participants Semantic web links would ensure that there is no violation in naming conventions as new logistics applications are discovered Connectionist architectures 10 


would enable the Class of Supply and other ontologies to optimally evolve with remote science networks catering to the diversity of exploration missions around the world 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has introduced some of the formal process models for data fusion which have been developed by the remote sensing and defense communities An overview of sensor and sensor platforms was described as they relate to the concepts and challenges of multi-sensor data fusion The role of fusion in ontological engineering was also discussed specifically as it relates to knowledge databases for fusion Ontology reuse can be a major facilitator for creating blackboard architectures for knowledge representation Systems engineering processes can play an important role in structuring and implementing complex fusion designs beginning with concept selection A Pugh Concept Screening Matrix was developed See Appendix which ranked several potential application areas for their adaptability to C4ISR-type fusion The medical diagnostics domain was found to be the most strongly correlated with the JDL data processing criteria The data may be simply gathered through visual observation thermometers etc or processed using sophisticated sensor machines based on nuclear magnetic resonance acoustic imaging and X-ray imaging In either case there is a clear demand for the high-tech application of fusion software algorithms and hardware sensing devices in this expanding and important field Future research in data fusion might address how ObjectProcess Methodology can be used to better understand problems related to concurrency control in localized sensors and distributed sensor networks It may also include an application of the fusion models developed for commercial implementation in vehicle health monitoring marketing science and logistics or supply chain management Additional research is required into designing data fusion test-beds so that some of the tracker-correlator architectures discussed in this thesis can be evaluated and verified for performance Finally research can be undertaken in developing robust ontologies that will enable the benefits of multi-sensor fusion to be more widely accessible through the Semantic Web 7 APPENDIX This Pugh Concept Selection screen is designed to weight application areas against the processes in the JDL implementation model The baseline reference case is the C4ISR system all other selection criteria are comparatively ranked against the reference case  or  The method was developed to help narrow concepts quickly and to improve them in a structured manner As we can see it is an imperfect approachaccording to the ranking the selection matrix above would not have us develop a fusion system for an intelligent transportation system However all indicators point to this being a worthy implementation of data fusion Kobayashi et al 15 proposed the Kalman approach for fusing measurement data from differential GPS wheel speedometer and optical fibre rate gyro And Mirabadi and Schmid 16 evaluated train speed and measurement through a combination of GPS INS and tachometers 11

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
