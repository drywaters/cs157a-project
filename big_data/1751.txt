1 INTRODUCTION IN A volcanic crisis time is of the essence Volcanic products both on the ground lava flows pyroclastic flows debris avalanches and lahars and in the atmosphere large plumes of volcanic ash can pose serious threats to life and property both on the ground and in the air Volcanic hazard is most acute with remote volcanoes where there is little or no in situ monitoring capability and volcanoes in regions where poor infrastructure and even civil strife impacts the ability of scientists in the field to monitor and assess volcanic hazards and risks In both cases remote sensing of volcanoes from space-based platforms often provides the first indication that magma has reached the surface and an eruption is in process At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory we have developed an advanced sensor web that utilizes models of volcanic activity to recognize not only at what stage an eruption is in but to seek out specific additional data needed to improve the knowledge of the eruption state Such autonomous sensor webs have applications not just on Earth but also on other planets such as Mars where management of large numbers of ground-based atmospheric and orbiting assets need to be coordinated to minimize resource use and maximize science return 2 MODEL-DRIVEN VOLCANO SENSOR WEB The Volcano Sensor Web VSW at JPL has been described by Chien et al 2005a and Davies et al 2006a 2007 A wide range of alerts or detections of volcanic activity or of impending volcanic activity are used to trigger observations from the Earth-orbiting Earth Observing-I EO-1 spacecraft managed out of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Alerts come from autonomous systems processing other spacecraft data on the ground web postings of detections of volcanic ash and plumes alerts from in situ instruments emails detailing volcanic activity and from data processing applications onboard EO-1 i.e ASE described below The new model-based volcano sensor web MSW Figure 1 is an advance beyond this simple detection-response operation mode where an alert of activity generates a request for a spacecraft observation with generally no deeper understanding of the magnitude or extent of the eruption that was taking place The priority of the observation request was determined by rank in a table The highest priority targets were those where either an eruption would have a potentially catastrophic impact e.g Mauna Loa Vesuvius or were of particular scientific interest such as volcanoes with long-lived lava lakes Erta Ale Ethiopia Erebus Antarctica The goal of the MSW is to have asset operations based on determining what additional information and data are needed to understand the state of a volcanic eruption The required information flow between sensor web assets is performed through web services The web service interfaces are defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium OGC Sensor Web Enablement SWE e.g Botts et al 2006 and allow for describing a process flow enabling extraction of higher-level information from datasets exchanging of metadata determining the quality of data acquiring instrument and data information communicating between sensors and discovery of assets data and data products and observation requests The MSW consists of several parts a a model of the physical processes under study b models of a set of sensors which describe the data being acquired as well as tasking interfaces c a set of in-situ and remote sensors together with their tasking interfaces d data processing capability based on the SWE interface descriptions to provide physical model inputs e a web-based data display and evaluation application at JPL and f command and control infrastructure to enable automated tasking of in-situ and remote sensing assets We will demonstrate a prototype sensor web using data collection assets and applications processing these data at JPL EO-i Hyperion and Advanced Land Imager ALI data the University of Hawaii MODVOLC processing MODIS infrared data and at the Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory MEVO New Mexico Tech which provides multi-sensor data of volcanic activity at Erebus volcano Ross Island Antarctica 3 REMOTE SENSING OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY Both the original VSW and the new MSW make use of Earth-orbiting platforms and autonomous data processing systems The flight of the first Earth-orbiting high-spatialresolution hyperspectral imager Hyperion Pearlman et al 2003 and the Advanced Land Imager ALI on EO-1 Ungar et al 2003 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ASTER Yamaguchi et al 1998 the high-spatialresolution multispectral visible and infrared imager on Terra and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS on Terra and Aqua yield observations of volcanoes at spatial resolutions as high as 10 m per pixel ALI temporal coverage up to four times a day or better for high-latitude targets MODIS and spectral resolutions of 10 nm Hyperion has 196 usable discrete bands from 0.4 to 2.5 ptm covering visible and short infrared wavelengths In the last years of the 20th Century and early years of the 21st the proliferation of orbiting sensors has increased the pace of data acquisition dramatically leading to the development of automated systems to process and mine the huge volumes of data collected for the nuggets of high-value science content For example direct broadcast of satellite imaging data from MODIS bypasses traditional routes of data transmission via a small number of ground-stations and has been coupled to automatic data-processing applications to rapidly detect anomalous above-background thermal emission 2 


Model-driven Sensor Web Science studies research and data analyses Models of volcanic processes Model input requirements define I needed observations Sensor Web event detection Autonomous planner Search for required data or request for data acquisition Spacecraft observations Automatic data processing physical parameters product generation Figure 1 Layout of the Model-driven Volcano Sensor Web An alert of volcanic activity drives a request for data to be input into models of volcanic processes to gain a better understanding of the event taking place Data are searched for if not available then assets are retasked to obtain the data For example detection of a volcanic plume leads to a request for data at shortand thermal-infrared wavelengths in order to estimate effusion rate Davies et al 2007 3  ____j lo 4 


Two such detection systems are at the University of Hawai'i MODVOLC Wright et al 2004 processes daily MODIS data GOESvolc Harris et al 2000 processes GOES Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite data from the Pacific Rim at lower spatial but higher temporal 15-minute resolution than MODIS MODIS has the advantage over GOES of global coverage four times a day with higher temporal resolution at higher latitudes The recognition and posting of the location of volcanic activity by MODVOLC is currently about 24 hours after data acquisition 4 ONBOARD DATA PROCESSING AND ASE Notification of the detection of high-temperature anomalies on the surface can be greatly increased by placing data analysis software onboard space-based platforms The NASA Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment ASE under the auspices of the NASA New Millennium Program Space Technology 6 has been in full operation onboard EO-1 since 2004 ASE Chien et al 2005b Davies et al 2006b is software that processes data from the Hyperion hyperspectral imager an instrument well-suited to detecting thermal emission from on-going volcanic activity e.g active lava flows or domes Apart from such data classifiers ASE also consists of a planner that allows retasking of the spacecraft to re-image targets of interest and also a spacecraft command language that allows the science goal planner to operate spacecraft and instruments Rapid responses at best within a few hours of initial observation acquisition have been obtained by ASE Of particular interest is the ASE THERMAL-SUMMARY product Davies et al 2006a b This is generated by ASE and consists of spectra the intensity of thermal emission at 12 wavelengths for each hot pixel identified in the Hyperion data by the ASE thermal classifier This product no larger than 20 KB in size is downlinked with spacecraft engineering telemetry at the next contact Often these data are posted at JPL within 90 minutes of acquisition allowing rapid identification of volcanic activity or at least of a thermal source on the ground ASE has detected burning fields forest fires oil fires and industrial processes that generate intense thermal sources Due to limited knowledge of the precise timing of the spacecraft observation at time of contact generally all that can be said is that a thermal source has been detected This is sufficient to issue a detection successful bulletin The resulting THERMAL SUMMARY product with intensity data in the range 0.4 to 2.4 ptm can also be processed with groundbased applications to determine the intensity and extent of activity Now funded by the NASA Advanced Information Science Technology AIST Program and with the invaluable help of the USGS EROS Data Center and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center downlink and transfer of raw Hyperion data to JPL has been reduced from more than two weeks in 2004 to about 24 hours At JPL data are spacecraft telemetry and image metadata to determine exact spacecraft pointing The result is that within about 24 hours of acquisition data are in a format where the thermal sources can be overlain of a map or photo of a volcano to identify the location of activity 5 NYAMULAGIRA DECEMBER 2006 The capability for providing crucial data in the midst of a volcanic crisis was demonstrated in December 2006 during the eruption of the volcano Nyamulagira also known as Nyamuragira located at latitude 1.41 S longitude 29.2 E in the Democratic Republic of Congo Africa Nyamulagira Figures 2 3 is a massive broad basaltic shield 3058 m high of some 550 km3 in volume Figure 2 The Mikombe cone eruption of Nyamulagira volcano D R Congo Sept 1993 The cone reached a height of 70 m GVN Image credit Minoru Kasahara Figure 3 The summit of Nyamulagira is truncated by this small 2 x 2.3 km caldera with walls up to about 100 m high Extensive lava flows emanate from the summit and from the flanks of the volcano Ikonos image courtesy of GeoEye processed to LIG that is a geo-located format utilizing 4 


Figure 4 above Nyamulagira in eruption in late 2006 The eruption was detected by the ASE Thermal Classifier Davies et al 2006b used to process EO-1 Hyperion observation E01H173061200633811OKF obtained on 4 December 2006 Image resolution is 30 m per pixel The most intense group of pixels white denotes the active vent where lava first reaches the surface Lava flows move to the west from right to left and southwest ASE rapidly downlinks the number of thermally-active pixels and 12 wavelengths of data for each of these pixels to a file size limit of 20 kB This image is at 1.245 ptm Location of the thermal source to within 1 km along the spacecraft track vector is not possible with this product until spacecraft telemetry and metadata are returned usually 24 hours after data acquisition Nevertheless this product rapidly typically 90 minutes after observation confirms the eruption has been successfully observed These data can be used to quantify thermal emission and constrain effusion rate Figure 5 right Nyamulagira observation EO1A173061200633811OKF obtained on 4 December 2006 by the EO-1 Advanced Land Imager ALI The active vent and flows yellow and red show up best in the short wavelength infrared bands Image resolution is 30 m per pixel The image is constructed from three bands as follows red channel  2.08-2.35 ptm green channel  1.55-1.75 ptm blue channel 1.2-1.3 ptm The cloud-free shore line of Lake Kivu allowed accurate positioning of the vent and lava flows manually The ability since May 2007 to geo-rectify data at JPL within 24-36 hours of acquisition will aid rapid automatic generation and distribution of such products 5 


It is located in the East African Rift Valley some 25 km north of Lake Kivu and 30 km from the town of Goma population 500 000 Africa's most active volcano Nyamulagira is highly destructive having erupted over 30 times since 1882 Recent eruptions have taken place every one to two years Smithsonian Global Volcano Network GVN Figures 4 and 5 Flows from the volcano cover 1500 km2 of the East Africa Rift Valley Historical eruptions have occurred within the summit caldera Figure 3 as well as from numerous fissures and cinder cones on the volcano's flanks Figure 2 Historical flows some voluminous and fast-moving have extended down the flanks as far as 30 km and have reached Lake Kivu on several occasions The onset of most Nyamulagira eruptions is characterized by violent Hawaiian-style lava fountains that can reach several hundred meters in height and produce copious amounts of tephra and associated magmatic gases The volcanic products extend for hundreds of kilometers downwind causing extensive crop damage and nuisances Figure 6 Model predictions of flow emplacement produced by Pablo Papale and colleagues at INGV Italy The light blue areas show the lava flow prediction model output showing where flows were most likely to go based on topography and assuming a large voluminous eruption The main flow field light blue is emplaced to the south west but also note the flow field emplaced to the east Image credit INGV Pisa Italy During late October and November 2006 increased seismic activity recorded at the Goma Volcano Observatory GVO of the Centre de Recherches en Sciences Naturelles CRSN indicated an eruption was imminent M Kasereka pers comm 2006 Magma reached the surface on 27 November 2006 when lava erupted on the southeastern flanks of Nyamulagira forming lava fountains and lava flows The glow from this activity was observed from Goma some 30 km to the south Smithsonian Institution 2007 The insecurity of the region due to ongoing armed conflicts prevented volcanologists from GVO from reaching the eruption site and pin-pointing vent location Helicopter observations were likewise very difficult and also partly impossible due to the very large amounts of tephra and gases in the atmosphere near the vent On 1 December 2006 an urgent call went out by email for satellite imagery to help understand the dynamics of the eruption A copy of this email reached JPL on 2 December 2006 The EO-1 ground software provides for an operator to identify and insert an observation into the spacecraft operations time line on short notice Insertion depends on an observation slot being available and also on the relative position of target and spacecraft EO-1 can observe equatorial targets approximately 10 times 5 day 5 night in a 16 day period In this case however such a manual intervention was not necessary The VSW had already triggered an observation request The volcanic plume emanating from Nyamulagira was reported by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre VAAC in Toulouse France and this alert was detected by the VSW EO-1 was autonomously retasked to obtain an observation of Nyamulagira at the next available opportunity on 4 December 2006 Subsequently the observation was obtained and the data processed onboard by ASE The thermal classifier detected hot pixels and EO1 was retasked to obtain another observation on 7 December 2006 F igure 7 iviocdel output trom IN\(V usIng the accurate location of the vent derived from Hyperion data No new flows are seen to the east More flows are seen to the southwest These flows have a greater potential for reaching Sake In the end the flows from this eruption did not reach this far Image credit INGV Pisa Italy Within two hours of data acquisition the THERMAL SUMMMARY product was available at JPL for study Figure 4 Although this product is not suitable for accurate geolocation of activity it was nevertheless an 6 


indication that the eruption had been successfully imaged Within 24 hours the full dataset had been downlinked and transmitted to JPL On 5 December 2006 images of the volcano showing the active vent and recently emplaced flows Figure 5 were sent to GVO and scientists in France and Italy These images were used to pinpoint the location of the vent and direction of flows The main vent was identified and was found to be some 2 km from the first estimated position This information was used by Paolo Papale and colleagues at L'Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia INGV in Italy to model likely flow direction and extent in order to determine risk to local towns As can be seen in Figures 6 and 7 flow modeling with the new vent location revealed that no flows were likely to be emplaced to the east of the vent Figure 6 Instead all lava flows were emplaced to the west and southwest with a greater probability of these flows reaching the town of Sake Figure 7 crossing the only major paved road in the region This vital road runs along the northern shores of Lake Kivu and links the city of Goma in the eastern part of the D.R Congo to its neighbour Gisenyi in Rwanda and to the town of Sake and the rest of the D R Congo Such information allowed volcanologists at GVO to assess hazard and direct resources accordingly The eruption of Nyamulagira in November-December 2006 was thankfully brief Flows from this event did not reach any villages or towns nor cross the paved road unlike previous eruptions from Nyamulagira and the nearby volcano Nyiragongo in 2002 drainage of the lava lake triggered a flank eruption from Nyiragongo sent broad fastmoving flows over a distance of 19 km through the city of Goma into Lake Kivu There was great loss of life and property Komorowski et al 2004 Nevertheless the value of the autonomous sensor web was effectively demonstrated during the 2006 Nyamulagira eruption 6 OTHER EXAMPLES MANDA HARARO In August and September 2007 other east African volcanoes were imaged as a result of Sensor Web operations The first was Manda Hararo long 40.82 E lat 12.170 N in the Afar region of Ethiopia In late August 2007 reports were received that an eruption was taking place in this remote region Triggered by a MODVOLC thermal detection EO-1 was retasked to obtain higher spatial and spectral resolution data Additional observation requests were input by an operator at JPL Unfortunately the vent location and area covered by new lava flows were repeatedly covered in cloud in the Hyperion and ALI data 7 OTHER EXAMPLES OLDOINYo LENGAI On August 29 2007 the volcano Oldoinyo Lengai long 35.902 E lat 2.751 S in the East African rift Valley in Tanzania was imaged by EO-1 The observation resulted from another thermal detection by MODVOLC Oldoinyo Lengai Figure 8 is a volcano of particular interest as it is the only volcano known to have erupted natro-carbonatite lavas in historical times These lavas are erupted at a relatively low temperature some hundreds of degrees less than that of basalt lava typically 1150 260C Figure 8 Oldoinyo Lengai Image credit GVN It was not known if an eruption could be detected by ASE as Hyperion was not particular sensitive to this lowertemperature volcanism Although a number of day and nighttime observations had been obtained from 2004 to 2007 no thermal detection had been made Excitingly the August 2007 Hyperion data showed two very bright sources in the summit crater with spectra consistent with hot newlyerupted lava There was an indication of a short lava flow flowing from the crater to the northwest Based on a preliminary analysis of the Hyperion data effusion rate at this time was estimated at 0.5 m3 s-1 Such effusion rate calculations are now being incorporated into the Sensor Web as a generated product for each observation 8 SENSOR WEB GOALS FOR 2007 Subsequent to the success of the VSW with Nyamulagira steps have been taken to fully-automate data processing analysis and product generation At time of writing GVO is developing a system to publish alerts to the Internet The second step is to create a software agent used by the VSW to detect these alerts The final step is automating posting of the acquired products and analysis to the scientists Our goals for the remainder of 2007 Figure 9 include the automatic generation of image products true-color and false-color images created from data at visible and infrared wavelengths that clearly show the location of volcanic activity see Figure 5 These are relatively simple products to generate but are probably of greatest value to volcanologists who are concerned with where lava is erupting from and where it is going As part of AISTfunded work data from Hyperion are processed to yield locations that initial analyses suggest are within 300 m 7 


along track and 200 m across track The process of plotting hot pixels on a map or grid is currently being implemented By the end of 2007 for each observation obtained by the Sensor Web hot spot locations will be plotted estimates of thermal emission and effusion rate generated images produced and transmitted to interested parties within a few hours of data acquisition Already the full Hyperion and ALI datasets are generally available for additional processing within 48 hours of acquisition Just two years ago receipt of radiometrically corrected data took some two to three weeks Figure 9 The Volcano Sensor Web at the end of 2007 including two-way triggering between spacecraft and in situ sensors 9 TWO-WAY SENSOR WEB OPERATIONS The current Sensor Web demonstrates the retasking of a spacecraft as a result of detection of an alert The reverse is also possible triggering an in situ sensor as a result of event eruption detection from a spacecraft Such autonomous sensor-to-sensor communication via a data-clearing hub has applications elsewhere in the solar system where nets of spacecraft rovers and aerobots can communicate discoveries to optimize science return and to safeguard assets One example of this would be a detection of a martian dust-storm from on-board analysis of data on an orbiter A storm warning is then automatically sent to assets on the martian surface or in the atmosphere Under an expansion of the sensor web such two-way data flow between sensor and spacecraft is being demonstrated by the installation of two sensor packages on Kilauea volcano Hawai i in November 2007 Boudreau et al 2007 which are connected to EO-1 via the VSW In this demonstration project SO2 sensors have been incorporated into expendable Volcano Monitor capsules to be placed downwind of the Pu'u O'o vent of Kilauea volcano Hawai'i Boudreau et al 2007 In nominal low power conservation mode data from these sensors are collected and transmitted every hour to the Volcano Sensor Web through the Iridium Satellite Network If SO2 readings exceed a predetermined threshold the modem within the Volcano Monitor sends an alert to the JPL Sensor Web triggering a request for prompt EO-1 Hyperion data acquisition Boudreau et al 2007 and increasing the data acquisition rate at the in situ sensor During pre-defined critical events as perceived by multiple sensors which could include both in situ and spaceborne devices the Sensor Web can order the SO2 sensors within the Volcano Monitor to increase their sampling frequency to once per minute high power burst mode Autonomous control of the sensors sampling frequency enables the Sensor Web to monitor and respond to rapidly evolving conditions before and during an eruption and allows near real-time compilation and dissemination of these data to the scientific community Boudreau et al 2007 10 MODEL-DRIVEN OPERATIONS Additionally we are developing models of volcano behaviour to make the best use of available resources We are studying sensor data obtained remotely and from in situ instrumentation from Erebus volcano Antarctica and Kilauea volcano Hawai'i in order to determine thresholds delineating unusual levels of activity This will enable events of particular interest either the cessation of activity or an unusually high level of activity to be distinguished from the usual background level of volcanism This could simply be a count of the number of alerts in a 24 hour period from in situ instruments or an unusual level of thermal emission detected from a spacecraft to results from use of more sophisticated models of volcanic processes For example we are developing a Sensor Web plug-in module that uses a model of how eruption effusion rate volume of lava erupted per second varies with time Wadge 1981 Plotting such variability can be used to estimate possible magnitude of an eruption episode volume erupted and even possibly the duration of the event 11 AUTOMATED RE-TASKING A key element of this new sensor web technology and philosophy is automated re-tasking In the existing sensor web automated planning technology is used in a combined ground and flight to automatically re-task sensor web assets primarily EO-1 This capability is hard-wired such that the scientist must specify the exact combination of sensor events that causes a specific sensor web reconfiguration usually a request for one or more observations by the EO-1 spacecraft In this effort this capability will be generalized in several ways First the triggering events will be generalized to enable triggers based on deeper models of the science phenomena e.g parameters of the physics-based model This corresponds to triggers such as effusion estimates 8 


Remote Sensing 36 1062-1071 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory-California Institute of Technology under 9 changes in the modes of eruption Additionally we will add the capability to respond with additional data based on classes of sensor data This corresponds to a scenario where a specific thermal measurement might be requested with SWE specifications being interpreted to assess available sensors and retask appropriately Second the types of responses will be generalized to new asset classes We will demonstrate space-borne information leading to reconfiguration of ground assets as well as ground assets leading to reconfiguration of other ground assets Third we will provide basic optimization capabilities to enable greater flexibility in representing scientist response preferences At first these will be restricted to single observation preferences e.g timing duration of a single observation or sustained measurement but in later years we hope to extend this to enable specification of preferences over a sequence of observations e.g a campaign with regular intervals Each of these technology advances will be demonstrated in the context of the volcano sensor web testbed which will link together space assets EO-1 MODVOLC with ground assets MEVO Such an approach can be incorporated to other Earth science disciplines 12 OTHER SENSOR WEB ACTIVITIES In addition to the Volcano Sensor Web other sensor web operations are currently operating These include retasking EO-1 to observe areas of snow and ice melting or freezing based on the analysis of ice coverage data disseminated by the National Snow and Ice Data Center NSIDC Denver CO This part of the sensor web project is overseen by Thomas Doggett at Arizona State University A Flood Sensor Web is now being tested where EO-1 is triggered from automatic processing of NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission TRMM data coupled to hydrological modeling This effort is led by Felipe Ip at the University of Arizona 13 FUTURE PLANS Future plans for the Volcano Sensor Web include 1 incorporating more data sources from other volcano observatories and data processing systems around the world 2 incorporating algorithms that process the ASE THERMAL SUMMARY product to yield estimates of total thermal emission and effusion rate as a systematic product 3 systematic processing of ALI data which covers a larger area than Hyperion an ALI observation is 38 km wide rather than 7.7 km wide with Hyperion and 4 the possible onboard image generation for transmission with the THERMAL SUMMARY product to provide context to thermal detections This product would be delivered some 24 hours before the full dataset is downlinked and processed However with strong constraints on the size of ASE products that can be downlinked with spacecraft telemetry 20 kb this might not be possible with EO-1 Such a product would nevertheless be highly desirable on future missions REFERENCES

Figure 5 Statistically multiplexed traffic We note that in this case we would be able to utilize some of the free channel space for other types of transmissions which may be more delay tolerant see Figure 6 For example in this figure the bottom blue transmission can be thought to be a file which is packetized and needs to be transmitted down from the spacecraft We consider this file to be delay tolerant i.e the data is not needed right away down on the ground and it has a lower priority then the other traffics needed to be transmitted The delay tolerant packets will be transmitted only when the channel is not being fully utilized as to fill in the gaps available in the channel bandwidth This technique will delay the arrival of the delay tolerant traffic but will enable us to more fully utilize our channel bandwidth m T]T m Figure 6 Telemetry traffic along with delay tolerant traffic being sent via a channel We note in above scenario that although the delay tolerant traffic was transmitted at time 0 none of it was able to be transmitted until time 1 Also we note that the final delay tolerant traffic packet was transmitted 9 time instances later then it was received For this reason a buffering scheme must be devised such that all the delay tolerant traffic may be buffered until enough bandwidth for transmission exists Since no specific data was available on the dynamics of the various telemetry type traffics we developed a generic telemetry model which is formed by two types of traffic one constant bit rate which represents the sensory information which is constantly being transmitted down to the ground and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents file download and periodic data updates We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to telemetry constant bit rate  peak of intermittent transmission We will also assume that the intermittent transmission file transfer will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new files are ready to be transferred Using the above model we created a Matlab based tool for synthesizing traffic for simulation purposes The traffic generated by this tool is output to a file in a format which can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 5 COMMAND TRAFFIC MODEL The model for the command will be similar in spirit to the model which we have proposed for telemetry We see the data transmitted for command to be formed by two different types of transmission One constant bit rate which represents calls to various preloaded spacecraft subroutines and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents subroutine uploads to the spacecraft We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to command and we also assume that the intermittent transmission subroutine upload will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new subroutines are ready to be transferred Using this model we have developed a Matlab based traffic synthesizing tool The traffic provided by this tool can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has resulted in the development of a suite of traffic models that captures the fundamental types that will be in the space communications environment and in particular These models provide the capability to investigate the new IP-based communications functions and resulting performance that are required by the human exploration missions of NASA's Constellation Program and the Space Communications and Navigation SCaN network's ability to support them Four prototypical traffic models have been developed from which any number of streams may be generated 1 audio/voice 2 real-time motion imager live video 3 telemetry including both regular periodic data as well as intermittent file downloads and 4 command including periodic data as well as intermittent subroutine uploads The voice traffic model stochastically parameterizes calls talk times and talk spurts Multiple audio analysis tools were developed to assist in the derivation of parameters from data samples taken from relevant space missions Using these tools parameters of probability distributions were fit to data taken from Shuttle/ISS archives 12     n 


The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
