Developing the Process Tools and Software Architecture for the PnPSat Initiative Kenneth B Center Design_Net Engineering LLC 10311 W Hampden Service Road A107 Lakewood CO 80227 303-462-0096 kcenter design-group.com Abstract Over the past few years the Air Force Research Laboratories in Albuquerque New Mexico have been leading the charge to establish a new paradigm for the satellite development process Central to this development is the Space Plug&play Avionics SPA standards which define standard electrical data and mechanical interfaces for all components that are used to construct the system 
Components consist of both hardware and software elements all capable of being integrated and tested rapidly to create functional capability It is envisioned that with the diligence being applied it will ultimately be possible to draw from stock items at a depot to design assemble and launch a satellite in a matter of days An essential enabling aspect of the process is a collection of highly interoperable software modules conforming to the data portion of the SPA standards which can be selected from a library based upon their 
ability to collectively meet a set of prescribed mission objectives If properly constructed the modules can self-configure on the data network ideally without human intervention or modification'2 Abolishing the segment of the satellite life cycle associated with the development of flight software is one of the most critical goals to achieve if the six-day-satellite concept is to become reality Design Net Engineering has been active in the refinement of these standards as well as a primary contributor to the development of a flight software 
architecture to validate the approach We have also created a development environment that takes advantage of the network-based data standards to allow code to be written and tested without physical hardware This capability termed Flight Software In the Loop FSWIL utilizes a robust simulation framework to present behavioral models of hardware devices to the software developer that are indistinguishable from the actual articles The PnPSat program is an initiative that has been established by AFRL to serve as a technology demonstration for the SPA standards Due to the fact that many 
of the core technologies were being matured in parallel it became necessary to develop the FSWIL capability to allow software efforts to progress without a supporting hardware infrastructure The tools have 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

IEEE 2IEEEAC Paper 1564 Version 3 Updated December 12 2007 important implications for the community beyond PnPSat however as they allow developers to write and test code or hypothetical hardware models remotely before installing new capability in the Responsive Space Testbed the home of the SPA initiative This paper will describe the 
FSWIL tool as well as the SPA-based flight software architecture and implementation products that support the PnPSat program TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 1 2 SPA AS AN ORS ENABLER  2 3 MODULAR SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE 3 4 AUTONOMY OBJECTIVES 4 5 THE MSDT TOOLCHAIN 5 6 INTEGRATED SIMULATION FOR AI&T 6 7 CONCLUSIONS  7 REFERENCES  7 BIOGRAPHY  8 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND In recent years Design Net Engineering DNet has been exceedingly 
active in the Operationally Responsive Space ORS arena Our efforts have been broadencompassing systems engineering efforts to understand the bottlenecks to rapid space access development of responsive avionics design of a modular power architecture the creation of an end-to-end coordinated design and test environment for tactical satellites and the development of modular software in a data-centric architecture to facilitate seamless interoperability between spacecraft hardware components and flight code All of these enablers have been brought together on the PnPSat program Although the primary objective 
of PnPSat is to demonstrate and qualify the supporting technologies it is also setting the stage for the six-day-satellite concept The target missions for this process are small tactical satellites in the 150-400kg class which can be assembled using modular structural bus panels with self-contained data and electrical infrastructure and bolt-on commodity support components and avionics The hope is that these standards will demonstrate viability and gain acceptance not just for this limited tactical mission class but for rapid and affordable access to space in general 1 


2 SPA AS AN ORS ENABLER AFRL has its sights set on becoming a leader in innovative approaches to Operationally Responsive Space ORS especially with respect to tactical satellites ORS is all about getting desired capability on-orbit rapidly and affordably This is of particular importance to the joint forces given the current global security climate Placing fine-tuned tactical capability in space has the advantage of being able to service globally distributed theatres on the timescale of hours or days while overcoming the restricted airspace dilemma that near-ground assets face The AFRL-conceived six-day-satellite initiative seeks to develop the capability to provide rapid call-up of tactical space-borne assets where the need for an on-orbit capability can be requested designed assembled and tested in a streamlined depotoriented process That satellite may then be responsively integrated with the launch vehicle launched deployed checked-out on-orbit and ready for service all within a six day window Accomplishing this requires that the parts that comprise a satellite can be rapidly determined assembled and validated without ambiguity The SPA standards act to enforce compatibility between pieces while selection and assembly of these pieces is facilitated by an integrated extensible process toolchain called MSDT that will be described in later sections Figure 1 PnPSat a completely SPA-based spacecraft Meeting the described modular assembly goals requires defining data and communication standards electrical standards structural mounting standards and the encapsulation of each system component's interface definition in an electronic form that allows the system and other components to understand and determine how to support its capabilities These issues all of which promote the component-oriented compatibility that is essential to rapid assembly and guaranteed operability are central to the SPA standards that AFRL has developed in the past few years All of these elements of the standard have been defined and are actively being exercised primarily through efforts in the Responsive Space Testbed and with the PnPSat program Figure 1 shows the design of PnPSat which is built entirely of SPA-based technology hardware and software The intent of this paper is not to describe these standards in detail but to provide perspective on how the data standards in particular are being employed to allow flight software to be highly re-usable and adapt to the physical configuration of the satellite The Satellite Data Model SDM 1 is a middleware software solution that along with the Space Plug-and-Play PnP Avionics SPA standards allows spacecraft components and applications to be discovered and their data registered in a data-centric architecture The intent of this technology is to allow modular software elements to carry their own Interface Control Document ICD mitigating the need for the type of implementation-specific development that has traditionally plagued flight software The ICD is expressed in XML format and carries all of the information needed to allow applications in the flight system to make use of the described component An xTEDS contains primarily three categories of information identity characterization and data interface definitions The identity of the component consists of information such as the name of the component the type of device or application the manufacturer or author model serial numbersimply the data that allows a component to be uniquely distinguished in an inventory Since the xTEDS is retained in non-volatile memory along with a device or as compiled-in data for an application the opportunity exists to download this information from the component as it sits in a depot thus alleviating the need to maintain a paper traveler The second category of data is characterizing information which can consists of bulk performance parameters maximum torque and momentum storage capacity are examples in the case of a reaction wheel limits and calibrations The characterizing information distinguishes components of a similar class from one another in terms of capability This information is important because it allows system applications to adapt to the capabilities of the resources that it finds As an example control gains in an attitude determination and control subsystem may be set based upon the capabilities of the components that it finds during initialization The final function of xTEDS is the definition of the data interfaces This occurs at three levels At the lowest level is the variable The definition must include a name string the kind of data temperature angular rate magnetic flux vector etc the data representation its scaling units legal ranges The standard unit of data exchange in SPA is the message which aggregates a number of variables into a logical container Messages reference variables defined in the xTEDS and also specify the conditions by which the message may be delivered selectable rates polled versus periodic When a component subscribes to data from another entity in the 2 


system the data is transmitted at the message level Messages come in several varieties data messages which are exclusively produced by a device commands which carry parameterized data into a component with no expectation of a response and requests which are two-way sequential communications command-response style The final logical encapsulation of data that the xTEDS defines is that of interfaces Interfaces are a collection of messages that relate to a coherent set of capability The typical organization of interfaces is along functional boundaries such as device power sensor configuration and measurement and device housekeeping To date xTEDS have been authored for approximately seventy-five spacecraft support devices and applications The delivery of this ICD at discovery time also allows components to be accommodated and validated in the flight architecture as soon as they are attached to a live bus significantly speeding functional checkout and initial integration activities The software side of the SPA standard largely defines how data is discovered and exchanged in a network-oriented satellite infrastructure The electronic ICDs mentioned in the paragraph above are referred to as eXtensible Transducer Electronic Data Sheets xTEDS They provide the basis for defining the identity of a component in the system be it hardware or a software module its characteristics the types and kinds of data elements that are exchanged in messaging the format of those messages and definitions of component data interfaces that aggregate a collection of input and output messages to standardize access to a device or portion of a device For a GPS there may be a spacecraft position interface time interface device power interface and possibly an attitude interface if the particular hardware possesses that capability It is important to understand that software applications in this data-centric paradigm also have xTEDS and that they are in the network sense indistinguishable from a piece of hardware The same benefits of data organization and interface characterization that ease the integration of a spacecraft support component into the system also extend to incorporating a software module that performs a role in support of spacecraft operations for example an algorithm application that subscribes to all data of a certain kind and calculates statistical variations Integration of these types of drop-in soft modules is monumentally eased in a networkoriented architecture We anticipate that these fresh approaches to software will be industry-standard once embraced by the larger space community especially as they are essentially a reflection of the direction that terrestrial computing has taken through the course of the networkcomputing era 3 MODULAR SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE Better software approaches are critical to realizing a shorter call-up to service time window for tactical space assets The traditional software development cycle for spacecraft is one of the greatest barriers to achieving responsive space objectives because of typically low code re-use and methodical time consuming testing methodologies SPA seeks to implement a new paradigm for software in which software exists in modular fashion in an assembly depot alongside PnP hardware If a satellite is to be conceived assembled tested launched and checked-out in six days there is no time to write and test code it has to already exist If software components can be considered to be pre-validated stock items building a functional satellite system then only requires determining the proper collection of pieces to meet the mission needs and loading it into the system with the matching complement of hardware This can be achieved because the data architecture is networkbased and because discovery techniques allow all data providers and consumers to find each other without the need for human-guided configuration Determining the required software applications and reconciling the dependencies between components are then the only remaining problems to solve and those are accomplished using the design tools that will be discussed in later sections There are essentially three major layers in the PnPSat software architecture helper applications subsystem controllers and activity agents Helper applications serve to reduce the data from PnP devices to data that has utility in space system context As an example PnPSat hosts several coarse sun sensor assembly devices each of which hosts four sensors The device ASIM provides a cosine value for each of the heads in the assembly in routine data messages to any interested subscriber but it also provides sensor boresites in the device's reference frame as static data during the discovery phase The CoarseSunSensorSolution application is an example of a helper It subscribes to all instances of coarse sun sensor CSS that it finds in the system then utilizes orientation information obtained from each device's xTEDS along with each individual head's boresite to resolve the sensor signal into the spacecraft body coordinate frame The application then sorts received CSS head data messages by signal intensity and uses the highest three values to determine a sun line of sight LOS unit vector in spacecraft body frame This data item is of fundamental utility to the satellite It is usable by a variety of resources in the system and is understood without ambiguity Other applications in the system may calculate this quantity as well and expose it in an xTEDS For example if ephemeris and spacecraft attitude are both available a Celestial Almanac component may also deliver Sun LOS Multiple instances of a specific system context quantity are highly 3 


desirable because it facilitates data robustness fault tolerance and graceful degradation Subsystem controllers are applications that map to traditionally understood subsystem roles in a space system These include for PnPSat Attitude Determination and Control Power Management Communications Thermal Management and Payload/Experiment Support The intent of the subsystem controllers is to roll up the capabilities of the devices and helper applications that facilitate the functional aspects of each of these subsystem roles Using ADCS again as an example the ADCS Controller exposes a standard interface to monitor and command the various modes that ADCS supports nadir mode slewing target pointing It also provide a planning interface to assist in the prediction of power consumption and duration associated with a requested maneuver to be used by the mission activity agents The ADCS Controller makes use of the device and helper application data interfaces discovered at run time to accomplish its mission-level role It is important to note that the controllers are static software modules that never change from mission to mission They are designed to make use of whatever spacecraft support devices and helper applications are discovered to accomplish ADCS activities Each mission may be built from different components and to different performance requirements but so long as those components expose xTEDS with recognizable characterizing syntax for data kinds the interface to the core space system remains the same Residing at the top of the SPA software architecture are Activity Agents These software applications interact primarily with the Subsystem Controllers using their interfaces to accomplish mission operations Activities are coordinated by an Activity Manager that coordinates the timelining and concurrency of various mission activities The Activity approach to operations has been implemented largely to meet the need for tactical spacecraft autonomous operations Additional details are provided in the next section 4 AUTONOMY OBJECTIVES Autonomy is the ability of a satellite to accomplish its intended mission objectives with minimal or no intervention from the ground Autonomous operations are a key part of the Air Force's vision for ORS because an effective tactical satellite squadron best serves objectives when technology allows them to be tasked and coordinated from the ops center in mission context in terms of objectives not having to worry about the routine aspects of spacecraft command and control This can be accomplished effectively with on-orbit autonomy using the more capable processors that are currently under development Rome Lab's Wafer Scale Signal Processor WSSP and DNet's Reconfigurable Processor Board RPB are examples Extra processing and better more configurable approaches to flight software will offer the opportunity to push much of the processing and routine operations out to the spacecraft itself offloading the ops center and making satellites much more operationally responsive an obvious benefit to an everincreasing arsenal of tactical space assets Interface to Ground Station Software Figure 2 Flight Software in the Loop configuration DNet has been working closely with AFRL on autonomy software on the PnPSat program We have developed with other team members an approach to spacecraft autonomy that characterizes and conducts satellite operations relative to activities These activities can be related to general stationkeeping i.e care and feeding of the satellite or to more mission-specific operations such as tactical data collection or information processing Regardless of the nature of an activity it is always supported and constrained by spacecraft resources available processing power thermal state attitude and orbit determination and control and target proximity That support is under the control of the individual spacecraft subsystems EPS COM ADCS GNC Thermal Each of these categories is supported by a subsystem manager or controller that interacts with the requisite hardware elements of the system to provide capability Each of these subsystems has a planning interface that is a standard interface by which the activities can query the resources of one subsystem as they 4 


relate to accomplishing the activity goal and then vet the responses against the availability of those resources from other subsystems Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchy of applications within a SPA-based data centric architecture with the Activity Agent Layer at the bottom These agents after using planning to determine a suitable execution window such as when a desired ground target is available to satisfy an imaging request interact with the scheduler called the Activity Manager to negotiate insertion into the mission timeline A priority scheme is employed to reconcile time conflicts between competing activities DNet is working on several activity agents to support the PnPSat mission including Deploy Charge Batteries Shed Loads TakeImage Manage Momentum Temperature Mitigation Commissioning and Laser Threat Response Each is being developed and tested using the FSWIL capabilities that are described in later sections The effort to tune the activity priorities to maximize the ability to meet mission objectives while maintaining the health and safety of the satellite is currently underway With the FSWIL toolkit those trades may be run in hyper-time allowing months of mission time with a particular satellite configuration to be assessed in days 5 THE MSDT ToOLCHAIN DNet has been developing the Mission and Satellite Design Tool MSDT for the Responsive Space Testbed at Air Force Research Laboratories in Albuquerque MSDT is one element in a chain of integrated capability supporting the Responsive Satellite cell of the Testbed It is a technicianlevel tool designed to isolate the user from the system engineering details of satellite design It must be understood that MSDT is not intended to be an engineering tool in its envisioned end form engineering analysis tools are to be recruited by the framework as needed during the configuration process to apply the captured systems expertise The goal is not to build an arbitrary optimized spacecraftit is to rapidy configure a satellite within a specific and bounded tactical mission class using a well understood and limited set of components The analogy is a tailored automotive assembly line or Dell style PC assembly line where expressed customer desires may be satisfied using the latest technology components and assembled very rapidly The core MSDT engine provides a point of data collection and management for the user to accept high-level mission objectives subsequently drawing from a centrally managed database of capability to determine a collection of spacecraft support components that can satisfy the derived satellite system requirements It is important to understand that in the realm of rapidly configurable PnP-style satellites payloads or experiment modules are also merely components If the mission objectives dictate the need for specific communications imaging or other sensing the appropriate experiment modules are selected from the depot inventory This is a philosophical shift from the traditional view of the spacecraft as the carrier for payloads In PnP all components are aggregated to compose a functional system Each component available for inclusion in a satellite's design exists in a central depot database Every item is characterized in terms of its relevant system utility physical/operating characteristics and performance This characterizing information is used by MSDT to deduce its configurations Figure 3 details the MSDT support infrastructure that is currently in development at the RST The innards of MSDT employ a rules-based constraint engine that applies relationships at the level of Microcosm's venerable Spacecraft Mission and Design SMAD relationships 2 to guide the process of component selection MSDT is guided not solely by SMAD logic but also by high-fidelity assessment capability coupled to simulation and the assistance of time-honored engineering tools such as SINDA which provide feedback in the form of

Functional Block Diagram Once a suitable configuration has been achieved through use of the solver and various high-fidelity design tools the support role turns toward integration and test Electronic products are exported that describe the satellite including a build list of components with their packaging configuration of the test environment for the verification process and a load of modular software that can meet the expressed mission objectives For the early verification process the software load is distributed to a flight processor stand-in while the spacecraft configuration is dispatched to a simulation framework that exposes high-fidelity behavioral models of the spacecraft devices MSDT also configures the simulator for mission scenarios allowing the primary operational objectives to be rapidly assessed Use of the assessment tools allows the performance of the spacecraft to be measured The metrics obtained termed 5 


Measures of Performance MOPs are then returned to MSDT to be compared against the derived mission requirements This feedback loop is an essential component of the integrated toolflow It allows the process flow to be improved with utilization The correspondence between performance and configuration is used to improve the fidelity of the MSDT rules and constraints that are used to configure missions Because of the composition of the process tools this training happens at all stages of the process from early design activities even trade studies through flight by virtue of seamless integration with the ground station software It is imperative to note that even at this early stage the actual flight software modules are being used to support the assessment exercises This allows a degree of confidence in system interoperability much earlier in the process than has been previously possible with traditional approaches Once the early assessment process has been completed MSDT exports the Bill Of Materials BOM for fabrication of the actual satellite from SPA-compatible modular panels and hardware devices The mechanical and electrical standards result in an extremely rapid assembly of the satellite When complete or even if only partially complete the satellite may be subjected to Hardware-In-The Loop testing by use of the same simulation framework to drive the components within the flight system by injecting environmentally-influenced data into the registers of each hardware support device using a Test-Bypass protocol As a result the flight system is rapidly and effectively put through functional testing that closely resembles flight conditions At this point the MSDT framework provides operator scripts and autonomous Activity Agents that allow the spacecraft to be exercised in Day-In-The-Life or Week-In-The-Life scenarios providing for final validation of the configuration using the flight parts and software MSDT is an extensible framework At the current time modules exist to facilitate the design process in the areas of orbit selection attitude determination and control thermal analysis power analysis and launch vehicle selection as shown in Figure 3 The Air Force plans to add capability to the toolchain in additional areas such as coupled loads structural analysis considerations in the near future to round out system domain areas It is important to explain although it is out of the scope of this paper that one of the objectives of SPA is to define standards for infrastructure components and pluggable devices that will naturally result in a system that does not suffer from some of the issues that consume system engineering resources in typical programs As an example the SPA modular power infrastructure and the electrical requirements levied on SPA-compatible components inherently mitigate grounding and electromagnetic issues 6 INTEGRATED SIMULATION FOR AI&T One of the essential elements of the RST process infrastructure is the simulation capability that supports the development life cycle Star Technologies Spacecraft Dynamic Tool SDT 3 is a component-oriented framework that allows space simulations to be configured rapidly and monitored using impressive 3D visualization It has at its core a high-fidelity six degree of freedom dynamics engine that interacts with robust behavioral models of spacecraft support resources to provide an excellent capability to integrate seamlessly with a larger component-oriented architecture We take advantage of SDT to provide measures of performance that are used to verify the ability of a candidate spacecraft configuration to meet its intended mission objectives The same SDTresident component behavioral models also facilitate both Flight Software in the Loop FSWIL and Hardware in the Loop HWIL testing with a simple reconfiguration of realtime messages Figure 4 shows a sample screenshot of the effective design support presentation that SDT provides to the integrated toolchain Figure 4 SDT used for AI&T Simulation Support One of the more powerful capabilities that we have developed around the SDT framework is the ability to attach SDT-resident behavioral models of spacecraft support components to a Remote Sensor Manager This RSM compatible with a data centric architecture allows a Data Manager component running on a flight system to discover and subscribe to data from those components as if they were actually hosted on a local processor This powerful capability allows SDT to present extremely robust representations of virtual elements of a data-centric architecture to applications and real hardware being developed or tested This Flight Software In the Loop FSWIL capability provides an easily configurable means of testing the xTEDS representations of spacecraft support devices that are so critical to moving forward the ability to truly achieve PnP in the data sense that is structuring the description and names of data elements such that they are interpretable and usable by applications such as a modular 6 


attitude control architecture or an autonomy agent that find them during the discovery process Once early validation of the software system against simulation models is complete and the physical flight system is assembled from PnP components integrated simulation support transitions to a Hardware in the Loop HWIL mode In this configuration the simulation device models exchange xTEDS-level interface data with the ASIMs which provide a test-bypass mode in which registers may be managed by simulation instead of by the physical hardware itself The flight software makes the transition from a proxy to the actual flight processor\(s residing on the SPA physical network Spacewire-based for PnPSat Importantly the flight software remains unchanged All that remains to be assessed is the ability of the software to meet deadlines and the network-based messaging communications between components to properly handle differences in transport latencies In the PnPSat program we are now at the point of quantifying these differences but preliminary results indicate that there are not substantial differences when relocating software between the FSWIL and HWIL configurations REFERENCES 1 Cannon S Responsive Space Plug  Play with the Satellite Data Model Proc AIAA Infotech 2007 Conference Rohnert Part CA May 2007 2 Wiley J Larson and James R Wertz Space Mission Analysis and Design 3rd Edition Microcosm Press 1999 3 R Strunce F Eckert C Eddy Responsive Space's Spacecraft Design Tool SDT AIAA Fourth Responsive Space Conference 2006 7 CONCLUSIONS Design Net has provided extensive support to the Air Force's Operationally Responsive Space research efforts providing key support in several areas that facilitate the ability to configure and deploy tactical space assets within improbably short periods of time We have used the SPA data standards and a novel autonomy architecture to develop modular application code that can organically connect at runtime on a data network to provide desired missionoriented capability This approach shows great promise for building an inventory of stock software elements that can be used to rapidly assemble capability for a limited class of satellites The MSDT toolchain facilitates control of the end-to-end satellite life cycle leveraging from the SPA standards to enable design analysis assembly testing verification and on-orbit command and control of this new class of satellites The first test of this technology will be the PnPSat mission which seeks to demonstrate the viability of these approaches and the enabling technologies and standards upon which they are built PnPSat is moving toward launch readiness in the middle of 2008 7

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
