Automated Health Management for Gas Turbine Engine Accessory System Components Carl S Byington Matthew J Watson Sudarshan P Bharadwaj Impact Technologies LLC 2571 Park Center Blvd Suite 1 State College PA 16801 814-861-6273 Carl.Byington impact-tek.com Abstract-Traditional engine health management development has focused on major gas turbine engine turbomachinery components such as disks blades and main bearings because these components are expensive to maintain and their failures frequently have safety implications However 
the majority of the events that compromise mission success and equipment availability in military aircraft arise from the degradation or failures of engine accessory system components such as valves pumps and actuators Failure or statistical-based maintenance of these components fails to account for unanticipated and extreme operating scenarios which are a major cause of unscheduled maintenance events U.S military systems are thus moving toward condition-based maintenance CBM wherein maintenance is performed as 
and when required thus improving asset availability and contributing significantly to mission success.1 2 The authors have developed low-overhead diagnostics and prognostics techniques which would enable a shift toward CBM of engine accessory components The current work focused on aircraft fuel and lubrication systems Modelbased and data-driven techniques were developed to provide reliable health assessments of hydraulic pumps and valves which are essential components on these systems TABLE OF

to be balanced with total operating cost using a risk-based decision making process Such algorithms would find ready application on board the current fleet of military aircraft as well as on emerging platforms such as the F-35 Lightning II a.k.a Joint Strike Fighter Not only does the current work help address safety and life cycle cost concerns but it also addresses the risk that unforeseen failures can have on system readiness Effective military operations require 
accurate knowledge of the health of operational assets which can be obtained by using equipment monitoring and assessment technologies This knowledge when combined with the anticipated wear-and-tear effects of the planned mission on each component is vital for optimal planning and mission execution Automated condition assessments and prognostics thus achieve the goal of putting the right asset on the right mission at the right time Low overhead techniques are needed that could provide 
reliable health assessment diagnostics and prognostics of gas turbine accessories Such techniques would enable a shift in maintenance strategies towards condition-based maintenance Solutions to this problem would rely on applying novel algorithms to the existing signal inputs and outputs of the accessory components rather than on the induction of additional sensors which would add significantly to cost and complexity The authors have therefore developed embeddable software modules for autonomous health management 
of gas turbine engine fluid system components These modules allow incipient detection of impending failure and pre-emptive action at opportune times for maintenance An experimental setup was chosen to represent aircraft fuel and lubrication systems Faults were then seeded on the setup and the developed routines were trained and validated with experimental data 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

2 TECHNICAL APPROACH Figure 1 illustrates the developed approach to gas turbine engine fluid system health management The combination of model-based and analytical approaches as shown in the figure captures the physical characteristics of the component along with diagnostic information extracted from analyzing available data from the system This ensures a more confident and reliable prediction The model-based approach ensures that faults are traced back to physically meaningful parameters while the data-driven approach captures higher order dynamics which may be difficult to model Model-based and Data-driven PHM The model-based approach to PHM applies physical modeling and advanced parametric identification techniques As an advantage over black-box or purely data-driven health-monitoring schemes faults and failure modes are traced back to physically meaningful system parameters The approach employs a mathematical dynamic model of the system that is directly tied to the physical processes that drive the health of the component The difference between the simulated response obtained by feeding the control command to the system model and actual response obtained from the system running realtime is used to perform an estimation of system parameters e.g efficiency friction factors etc The estimated parameters are then compared with the baseline parameters to identify isolate and quantify system faults An additional benefit of developing a model for modelbased PHM is that the model can also be used to simulate fault cases or fault levels that are not cost effective or possible to execute on a full-system full-scale odlel Baedi CtoApro CoSigals S;i;,igr1 a1s experimental test platform These faults may be quickly and inexpensively seeded into the model for simulation of the system response Use of available experimental data is however still crucial to this effort for the purpose of tuning and validation In addition to the model-based approach the authors have implemented data-driven techniques to capture information that might be difficult to capture in a physical model owing to model limitations measurement uncertainties higher order effects or other dynamic confounds Data-driven approaches continuously monitor sensor signals and identify differences from baseline signals Faulted conditions may cause certain signals to increase or decrease while having negligible effect on the remaining signals By identifying the signals and features that increase or decrease as compared to baseline operation the presence of various faults may be inferred while the degree of deviation from baseline responses is indicative of the severity of the fault A core concept within the data-driven PHM approach especially when applicable to high bandwidth data is the extraction of features a process that is common within the condition monitoring and automated health management community Fundamentally features represent a reduced set of data or information that can be closely tied to the health of the system The need for feature extraction arises primarily due to a recognized inability to store raw data over long periods of time Second and perhaps more importantly most of the raw data does not contain insightful information Proven techniques for generating features include signal processing and neural network black-box modeling Within the overall PHM architecture these features provide collaborative quantitative evidence of degradation in the system Figure 1 Technical approach 2

6 Fluid viscosity is assumed to be invariant with pressurethis is a good approximation for the small range of pressures encountered in the FSTB A dynamic model of this type might require more resources than available on legacy on-board computing platforms Since the end goal of this research is to develop PHM systems that operate real-time on aircraft platforms a reduced-order model was also developed and validated against the full dynamic model This reduced-order model was developed based on the governing equations of fluid flow in positive displacement pumps and makes the same assumptions as the dynamic model above In addition the reduced-order model also assumes steady state flow The mathematical model is described below For positive displacement pumps the amount of fluid transported per shaft revolution is a fixed quantity which means that at steady state the flow rate delivered is ideally only a function of the pump RPM and is independent of the pressure head developed or the temperature of the fluid However in practice there is a slight dependence of the flow rate on the fluid pressure and temperature even for incompressible fluids owing to the fact that the seals between the stationary and rotating elements within the pump are not perfect Thus there is always a small flow loss due to leakage and this leakage increases with the pressure difference between the outlet and the suction sides In addition leakage flows also vary inversely with the viscosity of the fluid which in turn decreases with the fluid temperature These relationships are summarized in the equation below _ Nq AP 60 RL\(T AP=P-P 1 where q  Flow per revolution GPM I rev N  Shaft RPM RL Q Leakage resistance psi/GPM Flow rate GPM P  Outlet pressure psi Pi  Inlet pressure psi T  Fluid temperature K In Equation 1 above the leakage resistance RL represents the hydraulic resistance offered by the seals to the fluid leakage flow This resistance term is a function of the fluid viscosity RL V 2 where v is the viscosity of the fluid As the above equation shows the resistance to fluid flow increases with increasing fluid viscosity The viscosity of hydraulic fluids may be assumed to vary with temperature in Arrhenius fashion as below v=voexpK-b-j 0 3 where vo is the viscosity at the reference temperature TO and b is the temperature coefficient of viscosity As the above equation indicates viscosity of most liquids decreases with increasing temperature Thus the leakage resistance may be assumed to decrease with temperature as RL  RLO expK-bK T  4 where RLO is the leakage resistance at temperature The leakage flow QL may thus vary with pressure and temperature as below the reference be assumed to QL\(P RAT  R expt b I  Q RL\(T RLO T TO RL PoP Pi T RPK iJe bI IJ QLOQ jexpKbK PLO D RLO 5 where QLO is the leakage flow at the reference conditions P0 To Equation 1 may then be rewritten as Q  Nq QLO p _ p exp b I  60 P iT T 6 Recasting this equation in terms of the pump RPM gives N Q  QLO p expK b K 7 Equation 7 above provides a basis for applying modelbased PHM on the gear pump system 4 


This mathematical model uses the control command signal to predict the system response and the differences between this predicted response and the actual response of the system yield system parameters The estimated parameters are then compared with the baseline health level parameters to identify and isolate system faults and provide a measure of fault severity The pump parameters may be computed

data-driven techniques for fault detection and isolation These techniques utilize real-time parameter observation and monitor signal behavior for increased levels of deviation from the expected baseline profile These techniques do not rely on gauging the proximity and rate of change of the current component condition i.e features to known fault conditions within Ndimensional feature space As part of this approach case of Figure 5 the Euclidean distance between the current state and the fault region representing functional failure becomes gradually smaller was implemented to track and project the features DXS employs were obtained from on past observations These past observations on the system under faulted conditions These data enable the derivation of faulted features i.e features that as some type of degradation begins to are used to predict impending failures Evolutionary Prognostics as the time remaining before the current health state progresses to functional

system failure as well a statistical trending method These projections an exponentially weighted averaging function that an exponential function which are assigned to past observations with the earliest observations receiving the least weightage DXS forecasts was repeated until the predicted feature space cluster approached the functional failure region for any failure mode The advantage of representing fault regions within feature space is that multiple competitive failure modes an earlier section experimental data is needed for training and validation of the developed routines In addition to baseline data the developed routines require data collected a means to map the features obtained from 


Fault Simulation The collection of faulted data requires that known faults be seeded into the system In most cases it would be desirable not to permanently damage the system by introducing the fault and this requirement dictates a careful choice of faults to be simulated as well as their severity levels The faults that were simulated on the setup include 1 Flow loss due to leakage 2 Stuck valve 3 Damaged gear teeth 4 Cavitation These faults were seeded on the FSTB setup as follows Pump seal leakage was simulated by diverting some of the flow from the pump back to the sump bypassing the test section This is illustrated in Figure 6 As a result the pump has to operate at a higher RPM to deliver the same flow to the test section The stuck valve condition was simulated using a gain block which was added to the valve command signal that controls the fractional opening of the valve This simulated valve blockage since a reduction in the effective valve area would cause a higher pressure in the test section Thus the valve controller would compensate by opening the valve further so as to maintain the pressure setpoint Figure 6 Simulating leakage Gear faults were simulated by reducing the flow command to the pump for a fraction of each revolution For example if the gear within the pump which drives fluid flow had five teeth a damaged tooth would cause a reduction in the flow for one fifth of each shaft revolution The extent of this flow reduction would depend upon the severity of the damage Pump cavitation was induced by reducing the supply side pressure to the pump by draining the sump as shown in Figure 7 This also introduces air bubbles into the fluid flow which is another cause of cavitation Figure 7Seeding pump cavitation In addition to the seeded faults just described baseline data were also collected The data consisted of the RPM pressure temperature and flow signals at various operating conditions These data were then used in the model-based and data driven approaches described above to estimate the health of the major components in the system 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The collected data were used to define model parameters that minimize the error between the predicted and measured signals Shifts in these parameters were then evaluated to identify features that indicate the presence of faults on the FSTB setup Some of these features pertained to the pump while others were related to the valve One such feature was a parameter derived from the pump signals This parameter was found to be a good indicator of pump leakage being remarkably invariant over a wide range of operating pressures This model parameter was obtained by feeding the pump RPM signal to the model of the system and predicting the output flow Least-squares minimization of the error between the model-predicted flow and the actual flow read by the flow meter on the setup yielded a best-fit value for this parameter Figure 8 shows the value of this model parameter for the various fault cases simulated on the FSTB The top half of the figure shows the mean and standard deviation error bars represent 2611 standard deviation of this feature for each fault case including the baseline while the bottom half shows the same parameter over each data run for each of the fault cases 6

Real-time Implementation and Demonstration The authors have developed a software Graphical User Interface GUI to enable real-time implementation of the PHM analysis techniques described in this paper A screenshot of this GUI is shown in Figure 18 Figure 18 Screenshot of real-time implementation interface The interface allows the user to control the flow temperature and pressure setpoints to the setup The user may choose to view the feedback signals from the setup or as shown in Figure 18 to observe the results of the PHM analysis These PHM results are computed on-the-fly using real-time sensor data from the setup The interface allows the seeding of software faults such as gear and valve faults into the setup The PHM results shown in the figure include health indices and mean times to failure and confidences thereof for the pump and valve as well as the actual and model-predicted flow pressure and RPM signals The parameters obtained from the model-based analysis are also displayed along with the baseline values of these parameters In addition the interface has indicators to alert the user to certain critical faults in the setup such as gear damage and cavitation which might require immediate shutdown and maintenance on the setup 5 CONCLUSIONS Gas turbine engine accessory components such as pumps valves and actuators create a majority of the maintenance issues in aircraft gas turbine systems A combination of model-based and data-driven approaches was implemented to address the problem of predicting and forecasting the health of these accessory components Experimental data were collected on a test setup representative of aircraft fuel and lubrication systems and these data were used to train a developed model of the system as well as data-driven routines The model-based routines yielded features that uniquely correlated to pump and valve faults The datadriven routines yielded a feature which picked out pump cavitation There was a one-to-one correspondence between the developed features and the faults indicated by these features The routines were validated with additional experimental data from the FSTB setup The authors have also developed evolutionary prognostics routines based on the DXS algorithm for the purpose of trending and tracking the progress of fault features in feature space In addition a demonstration interface was developed to enable real-time implementation of the developed techniques These techniques constitute a significant initial step towards addressing the issue of on-board diagnostics and prognostics for gas turbine accessory components 6 FUTURE WORK Work will continue to streamline the developed PHM routines and to develop data fusion routines to merge the results of model-based and data-driven algorithms The applicability of the developed PHM algorithms may be extended to a variety of gas turbine engine fluid systems such as engine compressor and nozzle systems starting systems and Auxiliary Power Units APUs and fuel and lube systems Engine fluid system reliability data may be included to improve the fidelity of the PHM algorithms in predicting impending failures and Remaining Useful Life RUL given current health status and envisioned use In addition dedicated PHM system prototypes may be developed for fuel and lubrication system health assessment and these prototypes may be tested on OEM test cells 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work has significantly benefited from the invaluable support and technical input from the Wright Patterson Air Force Base The authors would also like to acknowledge financial support for this work provided through the Air Force Small Business Innovative Research SBIR program In addition we would like to recognize the contributions of our colleague Matthew Smith 8 REFERENCES 1 DUSD\(LMR CBM+Memorandum November 2002 Available at Defense Acquisition Guidebook 2 Department of Defense Web site DoD Instruction 5.2 3.,9,2,,asp3.9.2 3 Pratt and Whitney Web site ht pr 4 J Rhoades JSF System Development and Demonstration CodeOne Magazine 17 2002 Available on-line at 11

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
