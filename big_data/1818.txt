of the Theory of Constraints by Goldratt to iteratively improve the process of maintaining a fleet of aircraft The idea is to treat support as a process rather than doing the typical analysis and focus on improving the individual elements of the process without considering the effects on the process as a whole The approach described is iterative and adaptive to address the nature of a complex support system The Theory of Constraints is widely used as an 
analysis method to improve manufacturing processes The paper recasts fleet support as a process where throughput is fleet readiness inventory is the aircraft support equipment spares and maintainers and work in progress is the current faults/degradation that needs attention Some results are given that were generated using a support process simulation tool based on a generic fleet of Advanced Air Mobility Aircraft1 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION

of a manufacturing system as the simultaneous increase in throughput decrease of work in progress and decrease in inventory Simply put TOC says that throughput will generally be limited by one bottleneck or constraint Once the limiting constraint is found the process should be managed to increase 1 1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 
C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1340 Version 4 Updated January 15 2008 throughput decrease work in 
progress and decrease inventory to create improvement Continuous improvement can then be realized by finding and addressing each successive bottleneck that is limiting throughput The objective of this paper is to report results on an investigation into the potential use of Goldratt's methods as a general framework for continuous improvement in fleet readiness Fleet readiness is dependent on a number of complex activities and technologies that occur in the operation of any significant 
fleet of vehicles These support system activities typically include  Effectiveness of operations maintenance and logistics planning and decision making  Transportation and stocking of spares  Quality of on-board and off-board diagnostic and prognostics the number of required inspections  Maintenance personnel training  Checkout/validation of repairs or vehicle status prior to use e.g takeoff  Repair of worn or faulty systems at the intermediate or depot 
level  Efficiency of maintenance and repair procedures The end to end process which produces fleet readiness is a much interconnected complex heterogeneous collection of activities This paper is a work in progress that is directed at creating an iterative adaptive process based on TOC to continuously improve fleet readiness The approach this study used to implementing the framework for continuous improvement consisted of the following 1 Create a process model 1 


Access Resources Replace or Repair Systeml 2 Identify potential bottlenecks that could occur in this process using field data and a fleet simulation tool 3 Identify and implement strategies to address these bottlenecks 4 Use a fleet simulation tool to baseline the operation's throughput work in progress and inventory 5 Iterate on the above to refine strategies and realize improvement The approach has to be adaptive in the sense that the process model and fleet simulation tool used to forecast the gain may have to be modified based on the strategy used to address a given bottleneck This paper focuses on establishing a proof of concept of the TOC method based upon using a generic fleet of advanced mobility aircraft as a baseline The Boeing System Health Operations Analysis Model SHOAM simulation tool is used to predict the impact of improvements that address the selected bottlenecks In the effort described bottlenecks and associated improvements are limited to those related to Integrated Vehicle Health Management IVHM at organizational or O level to facilitate maintenance tasks For example fault isolation time is addressed by improving diagnostic accuracy turn around time by fault forwarding and frequency of unanticipated maintenance by prognostics Results of these evaluations using SHOAM are included 2 PROCESS MODEL The activities related to maintaining fleet readiness were modeled as a process consisting of three major overlapping segments mission execution maintenance and validation of vehicle flight worthiness See Figure 1 The subtasks related to aircraft and fleet readiness within these segments include 1 determining aircraft health status i.e diagnose or prognose faults or degradations which includes onboard and ground-based analysis inspections and troubleshooting 2 planning and scheduling of aircraft operations maintenance and logistics actions based on fleet and individual aircraft health status 3 acquiring the resources to repair the aircraft 4 replacing components or repairing the aircraft and 5 validating the repair to ensure the aircraft's suitability to return to service Mission Execution Maintenance Validation Aircraft E Determine Health Satus Checkout Plan Operations Maintenance and P ermance i E Resouces Supprt Eqipmen/Tool Miss i Read  Aircr Improving fleet readiness thus the productivity of fleet depends on the efficient execution of these tasks for the vehicles in the fleet In this model we define throughput as readiness of the fleet given a fleet and a mission demand for the period under consideration Work-in-progress is the total number of identified active health events where a health event is a fault or system degradation that requires some action Inventory is defined as spare parts and materials fleet aircraft support equipment to troubleshoot and repair and maintenance personnel 3 IDENTIFICATION OF PROCESS BOTTLENECKS Bottlenecks are activities or conditions that constrain or limit process efficiency According to Goldratt one or at most two bottlenecks are constraining process productivity Finding this these bottlenecks and changing the process to eliminate them will increase throughput while reducing work in progress and inventory To establish our methodology in the initial phase of this work we choose to experiment with potential bottlenecks related to the quality and responsiveness of maintenance activities Typical maintenance bottlenecks that may limit fleet readiness and the corresponding approaches to eliminate or reduce the impact of these bottlenecks are provided in the following Turn Around Time and Reduced Aborts 1 Preflight checkout or scheduled inspections The automation of preflight checkout inspections or scheduled inspections can reduce checkout time and maintenance hours An option in this regard includes obviating the need for preflight or scheduled inspections through the use of prognostics The quality of automation/prognostics can be a factor in the avoidance of in-flight or preflight aborts 2 Excessive manual fault isolation or troubleshooting Improved diagnostic accuracy and ambiguity resolution can reduce or perhaps eliminate troubleshooting time 3 Unanticipated Maintenance Prognostics can prevent unanticipated tasks and help ensure availability of resources for tasks 4 Excessive Checkout Time Automation of system checkout after maintenance actions can eliminate manual tests or inspections thus reducing repair times Offboard Communication Trained Personal Materials/Spare Parts 2 Figure 1 Process Model Logistics Actions Health Componenta 


Effective Allocation of Assets Fault Forwarding Communication of health related data/information in-flight can give maintainers the ability to identify plan and initiate support actions during mission execution Health information predicted maintenance actions and resources and operational considerations are inputs to the real-time generation of response plans The effectiveness of these plans is a function of the quality of diagnostic or prognostic information e.g confidence or likelihood Resource Availability 1 Reduction in false alarms Reduction in O-Level False alarms can reduce the required inventory e.g aircraft spares support equipment and personnel as well as the downtime waiting for spares 2 Life Extension The life of critical systems can be extended based on increased knowledge or refinement of usage and system health assessments 3 Each of these areas has more or less impact on fleet operation depending on the specific concept of operations of the vehicle fleet 4 SHOAM SIMULATION SHOAM was used to generate and evaluate strategies to eliminate bottlenecks It was developed to analyze and demonstrate the operational impacts of IVHM solutions through simulation of fleet operations 2 SHOAM supports the creation of systems with specific reliability characteristics ages those systems by running them through realistic scenarios allowing failures to occur and performing maintenance Basic reliability maintainability and operational metrics such as sorties per day per aircraft are inputs The model runs two design solutions with varying levels of IVHM or maintenance aiding implementation and can incorporate multiple operational scenarios Results from the SHOAM model include system operational availability mission reliability maintenance utilization and waiting times for mission maintenance execution SHOAM can be quickly adapted to any usage concept and analysis need IVHM capabilities such as prognostics condition based maintenance diagnostic accuracy/ambiguity and service life management can be evaluated As shown in Figure 2 SHOAM provides simulation monitoring to compare two fleets A and B with different configurations for side by side comparison especially during a runtime setting One fleet can be configured as a baseline or both fleets can have configurations different from the baseline SHOAM enables the integration of operational and maintenance requirements into one decision support process that balances mission maintenance and health management requirements in the context of operational demands This will enable end users to improve operational performance reduce logistics footprints focus maintenance and logistics resources into opportunistic times and locations and improve overall capability of joint operational forces 5 THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS TOC To investigate the viability of Goldratt's TOC a process of continuous improvement will be demonstrated using the results of a system using fault forwarding diagnosis and prognosis features such as prediction horizon and extending component life through condition based maintenance rather than inspections TOC's principles will first be introduced and then described in terms of a production process This production process will then be transformed into typical mission operations concepts with areas in mission execution maintenance and validation Data that models a theoretical fleet platform will be used to validate the worthiness of these concepts TOC is a process of continuous improvement Rather than focusing on all the value added processes in a system Goldratt claims that every system has a bottleneck that decides the rate at which throughput can occur The key to continuous improvement is to recognize the bottleneck address or manage it and then repeat the process Central to TOC is the Law of the Minimum or Liebig's Law 3 Justus von Liebig is often called the godfather of fertilizer His model states that a plant will grow in the presence of all necessary nutrients But when a nutrient is missing or deficient the plant will cease to grow or grow poorly This model is expressed as an equation below dO  m I N P dt ki I k N'kp  P 3 


Typical Production System Next Figure 4 shows a flow diagram of a maintenance process using the manufacturing model in Figure 3 Faults are fixed and/or prevented by maintenance to make the platform mission capable In this example the maintenance system uses turn around times and time to obtain spares to measure the amount of work it takes to fix a platform The rate at which faults are transformed into a mission capable platform is measured by mission capable rate MCR and Partial MCR Supply and Support Equipment  Resources are required by the maintenance process to make the platform mission capable The levels of S&S E&R are measured by Maintenance Resources Aircraft Spares and Test Equipment Note all measurements should be done at general fault rates and at Forces Specific Rates These can be proportional to Sortie Rates Goal Simultaneously reduce Inventory and WIP while increasing Througput X  Turn around times I 4  Time Typical Platform Maintenance System In this system the bottleneck occurs in the Maintenance node which in this case determines the rate at which the aircraft is made mission capable again Therefore to increase Mission readiness i.e throughput one must increase the rate which work is done in maintenance However it is only considered improvement if the system is able to accomplish the goal by simultaneously reducing the amount of WIP and inventory There are several ways to manage a bottleneck efficiently One way is to prepare before the maintenance action occurs In The Goal this was described as preparing material in front of a manufacturing oven such that when the oven was done the time to reload it was minimized Another method described in The Goal was reducing the amount of work done on parts that failed quality inspection as the final product was being prepared for shipment In this case the plant manager utilized Quality Control spare time by having them inspect high likelihood of failure parts before they entered the manufacturing process thus only work was done on parts that had a low likelihood of causing product failure Combining these two examples if aircraft technology could forward the fault or health data upon which a decision support system could give a qualified recommended course of action then maintainers could prepare for maintenance actions while the aircraft was still in flight thus shortening the amount of maintenance turnaround time The recommended course of action may provide a confidence level to help the maintainer ascertain the quality of the information and thus allow him to prepare accordingly 4 to obtain spares Sorties Faults Qualify Flight Readiness  Sortie Rates  GBeneral Rates Maintenance  Mission Capable Rates  Force Equipment Supply  Support Equipment  Resources S&S E&R Figure 4 CDapable Rates l Mission Maintaied M1M111  Maintenance i Resources  Aircraft Spares li Test I N and P are nutrients that are required for growth 0 is the rate of growth and k's are constants So for example if the nutrient N is available at a dependant rate that is less then I or P then N is the bottleneck of the plant system and N determines the rate plant 0 can grow at This concept can be transferred to any system and shows that a bottleneck governs the rate at which any system can operate at In Goldratt's book 1 TOC is described using a production facility to show how improvement can be created in a system by recognizing the bottleneck then managing to the bottleneck The result is improvement in terms of the following definition Improvement is the simultaneous reduction in inventory and work-in-process and increase in throughput It is imperative to note that to Goldratt the reduction of inventory and work-in-process simultaneously occurs with the increase in throughput This is his criteria for improvement for any system 6 APPLICATION OF TOC TO FLEET READINESS The flow diagram of a manufacturing system shown in Figure 3 provides a top level process flow in which raw material is changed into a product In this example the manufacturer uses work-in-process as a measure of the amount of work it takes to make a product The rate at which raw material is transformed to a product is measured by throughput Inventory is required to make the product In this example we'll assume the bottleneck is in the manufacturing node noted by the Work-In-Process WIP label Demand Raw Material Work-in-Process Quality Throughput I Inventory Figure 3 Specific Rates MCR  Partial Mission Ak

Despite the shortcomings of this initial investigation which included the generic baseline lack of detail in the process model and process bottlenecks that were not systematically identified based on fleet data we were encouraged that the TOC method has promise as a method to continuously improve fleet readiness Future applications would be based on details from a specific aircraft fleet data as well as evaluations using the SHOAM simulations and include more detailed process model that would support systematic analysis of constraints or bottlenecks per Goldratt's TOC REFERENCES 1 Cox Jeff Goldratt Eliyahu M 1986 The Goal A Process of Ongoing Improvement Croton-on-Hudson NY North River Press ISBN 0-88427-061-0 2 Williams Zachary Benefits of IVHM An Analytical Approach Paper 1507 IEEE Big Sky Conference March 2006 of over 40 technical papers conference presentations and technical reports James Poblete is a Systems Engineer Support Analyst in Phantom Works at the Boeing Company His duties include enhancing and maintaining tools such as SHOAM that evaluate the IVHM alternatives impacts on platform fleet performances and life cycle costs and conducting concept of operations and cost benefit analyses of health management alternatives on select programs He joined the company first focusing on projects with discrete event simulation He holds BS degrees in Systems Science and Engineering and Biomedical Engineering and is completing the MS degree in Systems Science and Mathematics from Washington University in Saint Louis 3 Brock William H Justus von Liebig The Chemical Gatekeeper Cambridge University Press 1997 BIOGRAPHY Javier Cortez is a Phantom Works Systems Engineer for The Boeing Company in St Louis He has developed software for many Navy intermediate maintenance test stations and forward thinking logistics applications Currently he is participating in a system research project in the area of data management of Automated Identification Technology and Decision Support Systems Javier has a BSEE from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and a MBA from Washington University in St Louis Dr Kirby Keller is a Technical Fellow for the Boeing Company He has 33 years experience in the application of intelligent systems to air and space vehicles His current duties include Technical Lead for the Integrated Vehicle Health Management programs within the Support and Services Thrust of Boeing Phantom Works In this position he is the principal investigator and system designer for several internal research and development projects that are focused on developing a Boeing wide common architecture and best practices for IVHM He holds a PhD in Mathematics from Iowa State University and is the author 7 


used to match the type of the play and Java functions extracted the specific information However to be useful this information must be matched with the ontology To this end the type of play was translated into a specific subclass of the PlayType class while the context of the play was used to determine the appropriate subclass of the Play class and to fill in the properties of these two classes The names of the players involved in the play were used to find the actual instances of the specified Player in the ontology taken from the roster files By reading the rosters and creating the teams first we can leverage the actors in this way when ontologizing the events of the game This helps protect the validity of the data by ensuring that all references to an individual actor refer to the same entity regardless of how they are referred to in individual events This point is best clarified with an example To use the previous example from the Boise St vs Oklahoma game by referring back to the input files we ensure that all references in the play-by-play to Jared Zabransky Zabranksy number 5 for Boise St or any other tangent reference to a property are referring to the same Player in the ontology Maintaining data integrity in this way goes to the heart of using an ontology which strives to eliminate all reference ambiguity in the data The final step established above for ontologizing the data was to write the data to permanent storage The necessity of performing this step is predicated upon whether a database connection was established in the beginning or not In the early development of both domains we represented the ontology using Jena s memory model which stores the model and its associated triples in memory However given that combat simulations can produce many gigabytes of data with the number ever growing an alternative was required as every time the program was run with the memory model it crashed due to running out of heap space As Figure 2 suggests establishing a database connection quickly became one of the few viable options Towards these ends an Oracle lOg database was used to house the data due to Oracle's commitment in the 10g and the subsequent release of the 1 Ig to store RDF triples uniquely as opposed to performing a conversion to a traditional relational database every time Putting the information into the database had the desired benefit of greatly expanding the constraint on file size Additionally once the database was established optimizations could be performed on the data storage to improve the access speeds of common queries By putting the information in a sufficiently large database parsing becomes a truly one-time expense where it never has to be repeated If a database is used the program no longer has to read in the template ontology at the beginning and then write the output ontology to a file for permanent storage at the end Instead the program can simply establish a connection to the database when started and it then has access to all of the preexisting data including the template ontology 7 ANALYSIS Up to this point we have described in extensive detail the problem definition how the template ontology was created and how the data was extracted and combined with the template ontology to form the structured output We will now examine the methods we used to analyze the data For both domains the major obstacle to performing analysis of significant depth is the massive amount of data associated with the event In order for analysts to answer substantive questions they must be able to efficiently filter the data for the information pertinent to the question at hand To achieve this data filtering we used SPARQL.6 The benefit of SPARQL for our application is that it allows for the easy creation of what we referred to as N-th order queries that filter the data to preciously what we need in accordance with the ontology By N-th order queries we mean a SPARQL query that has multiple layers or orders of filtering that restrict the data This is best seen through an example For illustrative purpose we will again use the Boise St vs Oklahoma game Let's say an analyst was interested in finding out if Boise St had any big pass plays when they were deep in their own territory The occurrence of such plays would speak to Boise St.'s ability to use big plays to change the game as well as to provide some barometer for how conservative their play calling on offense was As such the analyst might develop a SPARQL query that has an equivalent English sentence of Give me all the completed passes thrown by Boise St where they were on their own 25 or less that went for 15 or more yards This particular query is a fifth-order query Explicitly the layers of filtering are 1 completed pass 2 Boise St 3 own side of the field 4 less than 25 yardline and 5 gained 15 or greater yards To answer the posed question such an occurrence occurred twice in the Boise St vs Oklahoma game The first was a 19 yard gain from Jared Zabransky to Legedu Naanee starting at the Boise St 17 at the beginning of the second quarter and the other was a 36 yard completion from Zabransky to Derek Schouman starting at the 22 yardline on the last drive of regulation The ability to perform such N-th order queries is absolutely critical to operations analysis in combat simulations A sample question an operations analyst might ask for in a scenario is Give me all the times a F-22 on a DCA mission was shot and killed at by a specific SAM type within a geographic region bounded by minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes This is a ninth-order query where the layers are 1 shot fired 2 kill resulted 3 target of F-22 4 attacker of a specific SAM type such as SA-10 5 F-22 mission of DCA 6 shot location greater than minimum latitude 7 shot location less than maximum latitude 8 shot location greater than minimum longitude and 9 shot location less than a maximum longitude Given unstructured nature of the output data from most 8 6htro ii uerV 8  1 11 I_ 


simulations answering such questions previously required extensive datamining that could take at least hours if not days to perform and was highly susceptible to error However a SPARQL query could return the results in tenths of seconds for small data sets and minutes for very large datasets Plus if the parse is well formed and properly debugged there is no chance for errors either returning a false positive or an omission Another tremendous benefit received from the structuring of the data and querying it with SPARQL is the increased ease of debugging the definition of the scenario This is not necessarily a problem in football but it is a significant issue in combat simulation The very large scenarios blessed by the government to represent certain encounters of interest have thousands of platforms each individually created with unique properties As such even a low error rate yields a non-trivial amount of mistakes some of which could profoundly affect results Many man-hours are sunk into validating the details of a scenario such as the networks of the IADS or the command chain of platforms all of which is tedious Several well placed SPARQL queries can help greatly reduce the scenario debugging time and make the debugging less cumbersome in the process One of the lone downsides to employing the abovedescribed methodology for data mining and analysis in the combat simulation domain is the lack of familiarity of most analysts with these techniques While the learning curve is shallow schedule and mindset challenges limit most seasoned analysts ability to learn about Java RDF ontologies and SPARQL To help facilitate the creation of N-th order queries we developed a GUI to wrap around the code in the combat simulation domain The GUI was developed using NetBeans Matisse GUI developer and made creating N-th order queries simply a manner of selecting the desired options on the GUI As a result the analysts did not need to be Java programmers with extensive RDF knowledge in order to use the program Instead they simply needed to have knowledge of the domain which is already a prerequisite for performing the analysis 8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The combat simulation domain is faced with the problem of having several different tools that represent data that is fundamentally the same in their own unique way The domain requires a method for combining disparate data into a common ontology as well as a way to then mine through the masses of data and filter out only that which is relevant to the current analysis In this paper we proposed a solution to this problem using RDF ontologies to commonly represent the domain and SPARQL queries to filter the results Due to the propriety classified nature of the work however we developed and presented a solution to a similar domain that being analyzing college football College football was chosen due to its similarities to the combat simulation domain which include 1 the output comes from a variety of sources represented in their own unique way but typically from ASCII text chronological log files 2 both domains contain ASCII lists of actors performing actions specific to the domain 3 both domains allow for a limited number of actions yet require tremendous ontological flexible within the actions and actors and 4 both domains require analysts to apply many-order filters to extract the desired in-depth information The bulk of the paper focused on the specifics of how the ontology was created how the ontology was combined with the data and finally the methods used in querying the data To these ends Stanford's Protege was used to create the ontology A Java program was then used to parse the data from input and output files after which the information was combined with the template ontology through the use of the Jena Semantic Web Framework or Jena The data were stored in an Oracle lOg database for permanent storage SPARQL was then used to query the data with a GUI assisting in this process The work yielded some significant conclusions SPARQL provided a simple methodology for creating the N-th order queries required by both domains Furthermore the execution of these queries provided access to data and answers to questions in seconds that required hours or days to get previously This drastic reduction in time and increase in the ease of use could literally transform the modem day combat simulation analyst from a glorified data miner back into an analyst Abstracting away the data mining and post-processing allows the analyst to focus on the forest instead of the type of bark on the trees in the forest Furthermore the unification of several sources into a common ontology allows for the analyst to be an expert in the entire domain not an expert in a specific tool Furthermore the encoding of the output into an ontology helps ensure the validity of the data and provides for additional scenario debugging assistance The validity of the data is augmented by the fact that the ontology eliminates all ambiguity in which entity is being used regardless of how it was referenced as well as any ambiguity in the definition of a certain event The assistance in debugging the scenario comes from the use of SPARQL queries on the input to the scenario such as verifying the members of a network in the IADS or the command chain of the platforms The SPARQL queries help provide quick access to the information and allow it to be displayed in a manner that is less cumbersome to crosscheck This allows for faster debugging of the input scenario

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
