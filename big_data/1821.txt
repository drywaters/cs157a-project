Managing Unstructured Data With Structured Legacy Systems David A Maluf david.a.maluf\(nasa.gov Peter B Tran peter.b.tran\(nasa.gov NASA Ames Research Center Intelligent Systems Division Mail Stop 269-4 Moffett Field CA 94035 Abstract In this paper we describe an approach and system for managing and joining enterprise semi-structured data in a high-throughput nimble and scalable systems with traditional relational database management systems RDBMS This paper presents the second release of NASA's NETMARK system 
NETMARK is an Enterprise Information Integration ElI framework based on a modem schema-less concept approach NETMARK schemaless information integration reinvents the way of managing semi-structured documents within traditional RDBMS We describe in particular detail the unique underlying data storage approach and efficient query processing mechanisms given the new proposed storage system upgrade We present an extensive evaluation of the virtual union between NETMARK with the persistent schemas similar to commercial off-the-self products such 
as Systems Applications and Products SAP currently utilized for NASA's Financial System through well validated applications At the heart of the approach is the philosophy of a well-defined and focused approach on most common data management requirements in the enterprise and not burdening users and application developers with unnecessary complexity and formal data integration processes This paper presents the details of achieving the integration between two incompatible systems 1 2

C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1360 Version 2 Updated November 08 2007 1 INTRODUCTION The Problem of Heavy Middleware The 1990's witnessed a significant amount of activities towards the 
development of ElI Enterprise Information Integration technologies that were aimed at addressing the ubiquitous problem of providing data integration across multiple distributed and possibly heterogeneous data sources in the enterprise Software vendors that included both start-up companies as well as larger players such as International Business Machine IBM were offering software based upon a middleware architecture The idea behind this particular architecture was that the middleware would provide an integrated access 
layer across the various data sources being integrated This is integration as opposed to the data warehousing approach in which all data is loaded and centralized at a single place for further analysis Towards the late 90's eXtensible Markup Language XML gained prevalence simultaneously addressing the problem of syntactic heterogeneity but not semantic heterogeneity across different information sources The functional key issue with the middleware architecture approach to seamless data integration is the significant amount of effort 
and resources required for managing and reconciling heterogeneous data schemas Schemas describing data in the individual information sources as well as specifying linkages across multiple schemas to form an integrated view of the information The amount of time and resources required for schema management becomes a key impediment to ElI technology being scalable and cost-effective for large applications Indeed as observed in an ElI technology review 1 A connected thread to this key 
impediments for EII is to address modeling and metadata management which is the highest cost item in the first place The original vision of intelligent information integration to nimble data management for an integrated access to information sources on-demand went awry We trace this to some tacit incorrect assumptions regarding how enterprise data should be managed and integrated These assumptions along with our alternative approach to addressing these issues are 1 


1 Data must always be stored and managed in DBMS systems Actually the requirements of applications vary greatly ranging from simple data that can be stored in simple document-oriented formats e.g spreadsheets and/or flat text files to complex large data objects e.g binary image files that does indeed require DBMS storage 2 The database must always provide for and manage the structure and semantics of the data through formal schemas Alternatively the database can be nothing more than intelligent storage Data could be stored generically and imposition of structure and semantics schema may be done by clients as needed 3 Managing multiple schemas from several independent data sources and their interrelationships between them is inevitable and unavoidable thus produces schemachaos  Alternatively any imposition of schema can be done by the clients only as when needed by applications 2 NETMARK AS AN EXTENSIBLE DATABASE Middleware technology should be a cost-effective solution and not become part of the problem as it is now At the NASA Ames Research Center we have designed and developed a data management and integration system called NETMARK that achieves data integration across multiple structured and unstructured data sources in a highly scalable and cost efficient manner The querying and integration of originally unstructured data such as various formatted reports in Microsoft Word Adobe Portable Document Format PDF Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations is a key focus given that the bulk of enterprise data is indeed unstructured A new paradigm we introduce is that of context-sensitive querying and search Let us illustrate this with some examples Consider a document report in Microsoft Word format see Figure 1 The document comprises of several text fragments e.g sections and sub-sections such as the section titled Abstract Project Summary Background etc A spreadsheet in Excel can also be fragmented into various rows columns cells tables and workbooks or sets thereof Similarly a PowerPoint slide comprises typically of a slide title and some slide content Each such sections or sub-sections are considered as topic headings to a particular context For instance in the Word report we have a Background context in the example PowerPoint slide we may have a Constellation Spirals context as a heading etc The actual document content then becomes the text graphics or other material within the document fragment that is then referred to as content For instance the text in the Background paragraph heading is the content associated with that particular context Figure 1 Fragments in unstructured data Users pose queries in terms of context and content where they are able to search and retrieve particular textual fragments of interest For instance a query such as Context=Procurement 3 would return all fragments from a collection of documents where the context contains the word Procurement case insensitive Similarly the query Context=Procurement  Content=Contract will return all fragments which contains the keyword word contract within the context of Procurement 3 A LEAN APPROACH NETMARK supports such context and content oriented queries over a collection of unstructured data of literally any common types found in the enterprise This has proven to be a powerful and effective paradigm for information retrieval in real-world applications In addition to data management and integration we have also considered other key issues in the enterprise information lifecycle Providing data to an integrated application should be an easy process requiring minimal effort from the user In fact many existing ElI technologies require that any data to be integrated should be massaged parsed or marked to be a certain format or wrapped for translation NETMARK provides a capability where data can simply be provided as-is Providers simply drag and drop their data e.g a folder with several reports spreadsheets etc sitting on the user desktop into a NETMARK-enabled server While maintaining the simple concept of the folder on their desktop the NETMARK system than formats and structures it appropriately for seamless integration At the data consumer end we further provide capabilities for quickly composing reports and presentations over the integrated data Finally the NETMARK system incorporates and interoperates with open and widely used data representation and exchange standards and protocols All data is ultimately represented 3 We illustrate using an informal query syntax here 2 


and stored in XML formats using open protocols such as the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning WebDAV are used for client-server communications WebDAV is a W3C World Wide Web Consortium Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Request for Comments RFC standard that provides a set of extensions in the forms of methods headers and content-type ancillaries to the HTTP/1.1 protocol for resource management namespace manipulation and locking mechanisms for collaboratively sharing and editing documents remotely from web-enabled HTTP servers Originally RFC25 18 was established in February 1999 and has been superseded by RFC4918 as of June 2007 The implementation however is purely relational meeting the ultimate objective of integration with legacy RDBMS systems 4 NETMARK The NETMARK architecture is illustrated in Figure 2 MAtlllEE3  INETMARK 1 L7U4 E D M5 Figure 3 Data storage in NETMARK Data storage in NETMARK as shown in Figure 3 has two the relational tables e.g DOC and XML which map objects to relations A document could then be joined by a primary PK and foreign key FK pair named DOC ID The XML table is recursively nested on physical row identifiers called a ROWID A ROWID is a pseudo-column within the relational tables that allow the fastest single block read access to the tabular record The DOC table contains the document metadata fields such as file name type date and size etc The schema-less concept demonstrates the ability to articulate context independently from content reflecting on structures such as tags or attributes of an XML entry but in a dynamic fashion The context and content oriented manner in which all data is modeled leads to a very efficient mechanism for storing the data coupled with efficient retrieval The data storage cycle is as follows Unstructured data is provided to NETMARK by placing the data in a NETMARK folder NETMARK then automatically structures the data and converts it to XML This conversion is done based on heuristics that takes into account the document format e.g titles headings etc to fragment the document Each document gets marked up as context and content blocks of XML fragments Each block is then represented as a node in a hierarchical document tree-like data structure We will not go into the details of a node later but a node is essentially the fundamental unit that captures the information in each context and content 3 June 2007 httSM swww.ietforn/rfc/rfc49 18.txt 5SGML specification IS08879 XML data store The data store is a relational DBMS that has been optimized to handle any data structure using a schema-less paradigm concept k 77 DOIO 2V4 WDEID 102 NODEN A#h MARENTROf SBtN I EAM I NE MAS rEN BL I E Figure 2 NETMARK Architecture Various clients such as data producers and providers and data consumers or both access NETMARK through a web interface We will provide some illustrations of this interface on both context and content querying The NETMARK daemon processes the incoming client requests and the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML parser provides functionality for loading data e.g documents into NETMARK The SGML parser hands the superset of conventional Hyper Text Markup Language HTML web pages and XML data formats SGML is the precursor and superset of markup language known as International Standards Organization ISO 8879 standard specification on Information Processing for Text and Office Systems published in 1986 The NETMARK daemon is a continual process that reads in any new documents inserted into a NETMARK folder via drag and drop features and then invokes the customizable SGML parser for structuring it and loading it into the NETMARK WebDAV RFC2518 specifications as of February 1999 http://www.webPdav.oNrg/specs/rfc2518.htmI WEBDAV RFC4918 specifications as of 


The nodes are stored in a relational table called XML The information or metadata about the document is also stored and maintained as well in the second table called DOC Note that with this data representation strategy the information in any document is ultimately stored in the same two relational tables XML and DOC This representation is independent of any schema associated with the document and is thus termed to be schema-less 5 APPLICATION A key feature of the NETMARK storage system is the simplicity by which applications and users can manage data and retrieve data efficiently unlike X-Path and X-Search based systems which relies on complex query languages The challenges for new developers and non-technical users to adopt this system are not well-suited to ad-hoc queries of information in a semi-structured data store such as NETMARK NETMARK provides the ease of use of a fulltext search engine with the capabilities of a semi-structured data store for information retrieval and analysis NETMARK has been deployed in several applications in the NASA enterprise It serves as the integration engine for other more expansive systems for information and process management With NETMARK we have been able to assemble new integration applications very quickly with minimal software development effort zero in many cases and typically requiring just about 2 man days for system setup and application assembly One such application is the analysis of mishap reports for Aviation Safety within NASA Such analysis reports are typically text-based reports describing the analysis of a range of accidents involving government both NASA and other agencies and commercial aircrafts Using NETMARK we are able to select particular sections and sub-sections from multiple reports and further load this information to data analysis and visualization tools seamlessly The integrated access and analysis capabilities over integrated data have proved invaluable to Aviation Safety Analysts at NASA Also the assembly of the application was done with minimal development effort and time NETMARK success has many industry spillovers leading to commercialization and collaboration efforts For example the NASA-Xerox NX system is the result of a strategic collaboration between NASA and XEROX Corporation where NETMARK has been integrated with many XEROX DocuShare6 enterprise content management systems with capabilities for text and document management NX offers a suite of capabilities in 1 Content management including capabilities for document management and collaborative sharing tool 6 XEROX DocuShare is a registered trademark of XEROX Corporation 2 Content process management for business process activities and management BPM such as action item tracking workflow activities and compliance NASA has implemented the NX technology at several NASA centers and in various NASA missions and programs including the following 1 The NASA International Space Station ISS uses NX to mine information for historical decisions and safety assurance information 2 NASA Program Analysis and Evaluation PA&E adopted the commercial version of NX in 2005 which led to adoption by the NASA's Strategic Management Council SMC 3 Most NASA centers use the NX platform including Ames Research Center ARC Langley Research Center LaRC Dryden Flight Research Center DFRC Jet Propulsion

the system. In additional SLA are used, mostly embedded in the contract, for acquiring and managing services by third parties. However, there are no such SLAs practices between IT and user departments  4.2.3. PMO-RALG  The Ministry does not practice any international recognized standard or framework and does not have IT strategic plan; rather IT plans are embedded within the ministry strategic plan. However they have developed a comprehensive IT Operational Plan for short- and medium-term periods based on previous MIS strategies and current ministry Strategic Plan. This Operational plan has Key Result Areas KRAs\ that are also linked to the targets of the ministry Strategic Plan. Some important aspects to note is that one of the KRAs is specifically on Information System Governance and these KRAs indicate clearly the activities and Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs  4.2.4. PO-PSM  It does not follow internationally known approaches and does not have IT strategic plan rather IT plans are embedded in the overall ministry Strategic Plan. This strategic plan includes general KPIs also for IT. Apart from that, the Directorate has created Client charter as SLA with user departments Though recently introduced, it allows measuring and improving its performance on a short-term basis Moreover, best practices like SWOT analysis are used in preparing IT plans as part of the ministry strategic plan. These altogether make the process of decision-making and monitoring more consistent not only to the Ministry but also to the facilitated MDAs  4.2.5. MoFEA  The Ministry does not follow any internationally recognized approach and doesn t have an IT strategic plan. However, it has an IT plan embedded in the overall strategic plan with activities deployed and monitored accordingly. This is also tracked from the expenditure point of view, where Medium Term Expenditure Framework \(MTEF standardized across the government is used. This allows tracking to be done both from a strategic plan and expenditure point of view, and the link established  4.3. IT Governance Relational Mechanisms Relational mechanisms are a catalyst for attaining and sustaining business-IT alignment, even when structures and processes are in place [4 h es e m e c h an i s m s are  important in the studied environment given the size of the organizations and nature of interaction required for a successful ICT integration in the corporate strategies and operations. Its practices are indicated below  4.3.1. TRA  Both IT and business people seemed to be equally aware of practices related to shared understanding of business/IT goals, shared learning and dialogue, informal meeting between business and IT management and cross-functional business/IT training. For example, several training opportunities exist for IT people in business issues, like tax administration and business people on IT. Meetings from strategic to operational levels are yet another opportunity bridging the training gap, e.g. using annual managers meetings to introduce new IT developments  4.3.2. MSD  In this department, practices include understanding of business and IT goals; for example no IT plans are formulated and/or implemented without consultation with the management and project-based committees. This ensures subsequent accountability in implementation and use in respective departments Others are informal meetings between Business and IT management for example to discuss business logic related issues during planning and implementation Furthermore, cross-functional business/IT training is also practiced in several themes such as customer care and effective use of infrastructure and applications  4.3.3. PMO-RALG  Practices include shared understanding of business and IT goals, where major IT initiatives are presented and discussed in the management meetings that comprise Business and IT people. This also applies to plans and implementation done through benchmarked ministry strategic plans and IT operational plan. Others are shared learning and dialogue for example through workshops; informal meeting between Business and IT people for example during project initiation and implementation; and cross-functional business/IT training for example on leadership and supported information systems. These together with other mechanisms ensure alignment and accountability in IT enabled projects [2 resu lti n g to  higher IT contribution to achieve ministry goals  4.3.4. PO-PSM The survey found out that there was consistency of practices related to shared understanding of business and IT goals, learning and dialogue, informal meeting and cross-functional business and IT training. For example, several joint awareness and training sessions have been held on egovernment and public service reforms. Also meetings span from executive and operational management types to the project-based and ad-hoc ones. These practices have assisted the Ministry to integrate IT to the current stage, which apparently has impact in the constantly improving public service delivery  4.3.5. MoFEA  The majority were aware of the shared understanding of business and IT goals, informal meeting between Business and IT and cross-functional Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


business and IT training. The first two are for example practiced through management and project meetings and strategic planning and budgeting processes. The last one is practiced in terms of joint awareness/training related to deployed IT and area of application. A good example is the case of IFMIS among IT and accountants where general knowledge in accounts and IT are provided, followed by the actual use or management of the system. Although the Ministry has a long way to go for effective IT Governance, the mechanisms in place have assisted the Ministry in ensuring that IT contributes to the organizational goals  4.4. A Summary on IT Governance Practices The practice on IT Governance mechanisms across the public sector in the studied organizations spanning from structure, processes to relational mechanisms pointed out earlier in each individual case, are summarized \(Table 2\d discussed in the perspective of the commonality or differences Table 2 Summary of IT governance structures, processes and relational mechanisms in the studied organizations  Practice Type Practices across studied organizations i\tructures Organizational  structure of IT function All are headed by directors, report directly to CEO and are part of the executive management and directors attend the board where it applies How is IT instituted in the organization They are mostly centralized and in some cases with staff distributed to work directly in a user department or branch Committees There are no IT steering Committees with exception of one of them At the level of the major projects generally there are committees established to oversee implementation Also in some organizations there are several other committees to handle cutting-across issues like security change controls and website content ii\cesses Strategic IS Planning Not directly applied  However, generally there are elements of its application in preparing corporate/IT strategic plans   SWOT Analysis Mostly applied across studied organizations in different magnitudes lower in corporate strategic plans that include IT and highly in the IT strategic plan currently in one organization Balanced scorecard Generally not applied. However one of the organizations started to practice it from the corporate strategic plan down to departments and individuals ROI calculation and measurements Not applied per se. However, major IT investment needs non-financial and some financial benefits justifications like the case of HCMIS project cited earlier COBIT or related IT Governance frameworks Not applied. However, one organization has started implementing some aspects of ITIL and indirectly some areas of COBIT Service Level Agreements SLAs Hardly applied internally. However, it is mostly applied for external service providers as part of the contracts Activity Based Costing Budgeting ABC Applied in most of them based on Medium-Term Expenditure Framework MTEF\ government wide tool for planning activities, resources, and associated performance iii\lational Mechanisms Shared understanding of business/IT goals It is widely practiced mostly through normal management mechanisms like management meetings and special IT project/programmes-based committees Shared learning and dialogue Somehow practiced through meetings workshops and training on issues pertaining to business and IT in relation with IS development and use Informal meetings between business and IT management It is widely practiced at different levels for example in clarifying some IT/Business issues especially when a new IT enabled project is being initiated or implemented Crossfunctional business/IT training It is widely practiced through workshop and training on matters of interest among IT and business people Performance Partnership rewards and incentives It is not systematically practiced However, occasionally some people are rewarded due to outstanding performance on innovative solutions Crossfunctional business/IT job rotation co-location Not widely practiced. However, in one of the cases, co-location across the units and zones/branches has been applied Virtual meeting" for business and IT people e.g Intranet use Not practiced. Although there is already Intranet in many of these organizations it has not been widely used due to cultural and enforcement issues Knowledge management Not widely practiced in terms of having the knowledge base of general or specific areas Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


The analysis of these mechanisms indicates that there are some strengths and weaknesses as far as the practices for each category, are concerned.  Generally the studied organizations indicate to have strength in supportive IT organization structure with exception of not having IT strategy and steering committees in most of them. The major weaknesses seem to be on the processes where best practices and standards like Strategic Information Systems Planning, IT Management/Governance & performance management frameworks are rarely applied and this could be detrimental to the consistency and enforcement in deployment, use and management of IT. Also while there is some strength in relational mechanisms practices like shared understanding of business/IT goals and Informal meetings between business and IT management across the studied environment, there are also weaknesses in many of these mechanisms including knowledge management, virtual meeting points and performance/partnership rewards and incentives. It is also worth to note that improvement on these practices is continuously being done, however not as a specific IT Governance project but rather as normal progress in governance of IT to further increase IT contribution to achieve corporate goals Looking at these results in the international context we see that they are in contrast with related studies in the developed world, like is the case of six organizations in Belgium [9   w h i c h i n d i c a t e d t h a t  most of them had specific IT Governance projects and applied best practices and standards  like COBIT, ITIL PRINCE2 and Balance Scorecard Taking into account the fact that one of the key determinants of the effective IT Governance in the organization, apart from constitution of IT structure, is where the IT decision-making authority is located in the organization l s o  tak i n g i n to accou n t th e  practices in place in relation to IT Governance key decisions in terms of who provides input on one hand and decides on the other, the findings across the studied organizations indicate that generally both are distributed across the organization as indicated in Fig 5. Specifically, however, the notable pattern indicates that IT provides most of the inputs throughout the decisions except on the Business application needs where inputs are equally coming from business related groups. The decisions indicate a different trend as are mostly made by executive management comprising IT and Business people, which if done well is likely to increase alignment of IT and business and smooth implementation of IT applications and its us Looking at related studies elsewhere and taking the case of MIT-CISR work and specifically on the public  iou s th a t t h ere are si m i larities i n t h e  pattern especially on decisions where federal dominates in both cases. However, differences appear in decisions related to IT architecture and infrastructure, done by IT Monarchy while in our case it is done by the same Federal. Notably, when it comes to the input, the difference seems to be substantial due to the fact that while IT monarchy dominates most of the inputs in the compared studies, our related study environment indicates to be dominated by Federal Looking at the differences in both cases we can see that the mature IT Governance practices especially on structures might be one of the determinants of the differences and required governance effectiveness    5. Discussion: Problems and consequences Use of ICT in the studied environment is still a relatively new culture and this has contributed to the problems encount  T h es e proble m s are  discussed here based on the representative case studies seen earlier. Also this section indicates the consequences in order that the implications for not taking necessary actions are known, so that this could be taken as motivation for change or further research  5.1. Problems As it was earlier indicated, one vital way of looking at IT Governance related problems in an organization is its key focus areas o applied by oth e r earlier  studies T h es e areas i.e. s t rateg ic al ignm ent, v a l u e  delivery, risk management, resource management and Fi g ure 5 The IT Governance key decisions patterns in the studied organizations  1 5 No. Of  Cases Occurence Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


performance management, are also applied here to look into the problems as were embedded in the questionnaires used in the survey. These problems are ranked according to the interviewees perspective on their seriousness in the sector \(Table 3\d respective discussion is done as per IT Governance focus areas Also the highlight is provided taking into account the summary and discussion on the current practices unveiled in the earlier section  5.1.1. Strategic Alignment This focuses on ensuring the linkage of business and IT plans; defining maintaining and validating the IT value proposition and aligning IT operations with enterprise operations  ook i n g acros s t h e s t u d i e d org an i z a t i ons i t i s  clear that there is no specific IT strategic plan in most of them that could tie the business and IT activities more holistically and effectively. This, among others leads to the biggest problem, i.e. lack of ownership by business people in IT-enabled projects \(Table 3\d in some cases organizations being forced to allocate IT personnel to do what business people should be doing rather than supporting them The aspect of inadequate or absent ICT policies and procedures is another problem that is also consistent across most of them. It hampers consistency in ICT usage and management, which is yet another serious problem. Lack of IT Governance awareness and certainly some guidelines are also seen as problem This is also linked with HR related problems on lack of clear roles, responsibilities and accountability that sometimes, among others, leads to the ad-hoc practices. While it appears that there are mechanisms to communicate ICT plans and goals e.g. through meetings and workshops, inadequate enforcement mechanisms still hamper the widespread use of ICT and promised benefits. An example is Intranet which seems to be in place in many organizations and can increase IT/Business partnershi d in tern a l  efficiency but it is still not being used widely enough  5.1.2. Value delivery  is one of the IT Governance outcomes and is about value proposition throughout the delivery cycle, ensuring that IT delivers the promised benefits against the strategy or plans t h i s  regard it was found out that despite the high cost of IT there is still lower return or business value. This happens due to the mentioned earlier non-optimal use missing synergies, and inadequate facilitation and enforcement for a widespread use. One of the interviewees claimed that some offices were still using computers merely as fast typewriters  5.1.3. Risk Management Risk management requires awareness by senior and operational officers and embedding of risk management responsibilities in the Table 3 Ranked problems seriousness as per survey in the studied organizations Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


organization [10  T h e sur v e y i n d i c a t e s t h a t ge ne r a l l y there is still a weak risk-based approach in designing and operating IT related services which is also consistent with earlier studies on IT security matters in the environmen w e v e r, f o r th e v e r y critical an d  country wide systems like Integrated Financial MIS IFMIS\at manages all government expenditures risk management is relatively higher and sometimes exaggerated. The latter is due to the fact that it has a separate physical network within the ministry concerned and across some government offices   5.1.4. Resource Management which ensures optimal investment and the proper management of critical IT resources  y et a n oth e r problem atic area i n t h e  sector. The issue of attracting and sustaining skilled and competent IT personnel is still a nightmare to solve, despite some efforts continually made Availability of essential budget for the required IT resources is yet another problem especially for low level staff, in regions and branches. Together with these is the case of fragmented IT initiatives with duplication of efforts and a loss of synergies and exploitation of the economies of scale. For example one could find heavy duty printers or photocopiers with capacity to serve many employees or offices only serving a single person or office, thus mostly staying idle. Moreover, there are still some fragmented business applications in the studied organizations  5.1.5. Performance Management that is important for tracking and monitoring strategy and plans implementation and benefits accrued and measured beyond the conventional accounting y et an ot h e r  problematic area. Although there is progress in this direction like the recently use of the balanced scorecard in one of the organizations or metrics embedded in the ministerial strategic plans, the environment generally poses some weaknesses. This again came out strongly in the survey \(Table 3 Others include inadequate follow-up and enforcement on the matters discussed in the IT related committees and meetings. This also indicates that putting IT structures in place is not enough; one should go beyond to implement necessary processes and relational mechanisms to ensure the returns on investme  As indicated earlier, Table 3 presents the ranked problems in the public sector. These results are also comparable to other related studies like those produced by the IT Governance Institut 2 5] an d th e MI T CISR study on 256 organizations worldw ile  there are differences among them like lack of ownership of IT projects, relatively lower acceptance of new IT applications, fragmented IT initiatives and inadequate enforcement mechanisms that hamper the optimal use of the IT resources, there are also similarities. These include staff matters but in this case going further to the staff shortage and inadequate IT skills and competency. Others are weak measurement of IT performance and value to the business, high cost of IT but low ROI and security issues  5.2. Consequences Several studies have indicated possible consequences for not having effective IT Governance in place, in the cases related to public sector in a developing country  22  Bas e d on th es e cas es an d a preli m i n a r y  survey in the public sector, possible consequences were investigated and bundled together as shown in Fig. 6. According to the study results there are serious consequences in the sector that can be detrimental to the effort towards effective IT Governance, and hence improvement in the public service delivery. The most serious problem noted is the difficulty involved in holding individuals accountable for their results Others are ad-hoc solutions due to user and management frustrations, which are obviously outcomes of not having a good IT governance in place where people finds their own solutions, and sometimes take this loophole to misuse the IT resources      Fi g ure 6 Ranked consequences as a result of the survey in the studied organizations  85 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 


Additionally, there are traditional consequences like IT investment losses, and given the magnitude of systems put in place in these kinds of organizations, they encounter the loss of a lot of money and effort when a project fails to deliver its promises Similarly, there are reputation damages which are also a nasty consequence to such large organizations for example, at a revenue authority if the system that deals with customs clearance or tax payments have some problems and there is no adequate governance that ensures the timely recovery or alternative solution this will be in the news the following day. Knowing the problems and associated consequences will assist the IT decision makers in prioritizing activities and solutions for effective IT governance and consequently the improvement in the public service delivery  6. Conclusions In this paper, based on the analysis of five public organizations, we have described IT Governance current practices, problems encountered and the consequences in the public sector in a developing country. The IT Governance mechanisms, together with key focus and decision areas provided the means for a thorough investigation into the studied environment. The combination of these approaches was found to be useful in uncovering practices of interest in this environment, where on one hand IT resources are scarce and its development and management are relatively less established and on the other hand the use of ICT in providing public services is gaining momentum and several efforts are being made to carry it out successfully. The analysis of IT Governance practices in the studied organizations indicate diverse practices in relation to structures processes and relational mechanisms with notable weakness in the processes where, in contrast with developed world, best practices are rarely applied in most of them It was also noted that improvement on these practices are being done continually, not as a specific IT Governance project but rather as normal improvement to increase the IT contribution to the organizational goals. The analysis revealed a number of problems and their consequences in the organizations. The problems we found are categorized in the IT Governance key focus areas, and are including the lack of a specific IT strategic plan in most of them; lack of business people ownership in ITenabled projects; inadequate or absent ICT policies and procedures; lack of IT Governance awareness and guidelines; inadequate follow-up and enforcement mechanisms; and lack of clear roles, responsibilities and accountability. Others problems found are a weak risk-based approach in designing and operating IT related services; attracting and sustaining skilled and competent IT personnel; inadequate budget for required IT resources; fragmented IT initiatives with a loss of synergies and exploitation of the economies of scale; high cost of IT with lower business value; and weak measures of IT performance and value to business In addition, to the problems and challenges in the public sector, several consequences that can be detrimental to the efforts towards effective IT Governance and hence improvements in the public service delivery were also revealed. The most common ones include the difficulty of holding individuals accountable for their results; ad-hoc solutions due to user and management frustrations; and traditional consequences like IT investment losses and damage to the reputation of the organization in question  References  T GI En terpris e Value: Gov e rn a n ce of IT Investments, The Val IT Framework, 2006.

The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
