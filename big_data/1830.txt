Abstract   With the advent of nanometer technologies, the design size of integrated circuits is getting larger and the operation speed is gettin g faster. As a consequence test cost is becoming unbearable with traditional test methods The big challenge for design and test engineers is how to guarantee the required high levels of test quality and yield while keeping the test cost low From a scan-based ATPG point of view, there are two main ways to reduce test cost. One way is to reduce test pattern volume and test run time. The problem is how to maintain the same test coverage with a smaller test pattern set. The other way to reduce test cost is to use lower-end testers, which are much cheaper but have limited memory, data channels, and clocking capabilities  This paper shares the experiences of a real case of how to significantly reduce scan test cost by using DFT techniques  1. Introduction The design is the first Dual-Core programmable CMOS digital signal processor \(DSP\series of products that target the audio market. Since this Audio Processor is for an automotive application, it requires the highest possible test coverage. It is also for the consumer market so the cost need s to be as low as possible This combination presents a common quandary for manufacturing test plans -- how to get high test quality at The design will be packaged into 4 types of parts The smallest package is an 80-pin quad flat pack, so only 16 scan chains are available for the design. With normal scan-based test methods, this requires more than 3000 registers on each scan chain. During scanbased testing, this configuration leads to a lot of time shifting test data into and out of the device which drives up the test cost. As the test time required for each device goes up, the through-put of the manufacturing test floor goes down High test quality is another challenge for test cost. As we know, at-speed testing is generally required to achieve high quality test levels [2  co st  o f including at-speed test comes in two parts -- first is the high test pattern volume need ed and the second is providing the required high-sp eed clocking sequences. The Audio Processor is targeted to operate at 200MHz and potentially at even higher frequency with overdrive in the future. A tester that can provide 1000MHz clock driving capability costs al most twice as much as one with 100MHz clock drivin g capability. The clock speed for scan shifting is much lower and can be provided by any tester The basic characteristics of this design are shown in Table 1  This paper describes how a commercial ATPG compression tool was used in conjunction with the test plan to get high levels of test quality for this design while at the same time significantly reducing the cost of that test. Section 2 explains how the at-speed clocks were generated and provided for the at-speed test patterns. Section 3 describes the logic and methodology used to compress the test data volume. The results of the compression are provided in section 4 and the paper is concluded in section 5 Table 1.

2. On-chip PLL clock generation for atspeed test This design includes an on-chip phase locked-loop PLL\r generating the high frequency functional clocks. To get a high quality at-speed test, it is better to use these on-chip clocks for test purposes instead of having the high speed test clocks come from the tester equipment. It is also a big cost savings because this approach allows for the us e of less sophisticated and hence less expensive testers To take advantage of the on-chip functional clocks during test mode, a small piece of logic in the form of a clock chopper was added inside the design which can generate qualified scan clocks during scan test operation. The clock control circuitry for this design is shown in Figure 1. There are many other similar clock control circuits described in the literature 4  6  7  Figure 1.  On-chip clock generation circuitry  To test a chip at-speed, only the capture clock is required to run at-speed In the Audio Processor the capture clock is generated by the PLL circuitry while the scan shift clock remains the same as the slower reference clock. The benefit of using the reference clock instead of the clock divided from the PLL as the shift clock is to avoid synchronization problems between the shift clock and shift-in data As shown in the broadside mode timing waveform of Figure 2, during scan shift cycles the external scan enable ext_scan_en set high and the scan clock  scan_clk comes from the reference clock ref_clk  Once ext_scan_en is cleared low for the capture cycles scan_clk comes from the clock gate which is only open when the chopper controlle r outputs a capture enable signal cap_ena  Figure 2.  AC test clock waveform for broadside mode  The chopper controller is actually a counter triggered by the PLL output clock pll_clk It turns on the cap_ena signal to enable the number of specified fast pulses through the clock gate which is configured in the capture count cap_cnt ster. The clock gate ensures the fast pulses from the PLL are filtered without glitches. The values specified for the cap_cnt register are determined for each test pattern and these values are loaded into the register cells as part of the scan test data that is shifted into the circuit The example diagram shown in Figure 2 has two atspeed clock pulses for the la unch and capture cycles This is a broadside or launch-off clock type of test pattern and a sequential depth of two is sufficient to capture the vast majority of the transition faults in the design. To detect transition faults around memories in the design, more capture pulses are often necessary The clock control circuitry described here is flexible enough to provide up to seven at-speed clock pulses for those harder to detect transition faults. Targeting those additional faults is sometim es required to reach the required test coverage goals The scan enable circuitry of this design includes a gated or pipe-lined piece of logic as shown in the bottom of Figure 1. With this circuitry, the design is able to use the launch-off shift type of transition pattern with the on-chip PLL clocks. The timing waveform for 
240 


launch-off shift transition patterns for this design is shown in Figure 3 Figure 3.  AC test clock waveform for launch-off shift mode  In general, launch-off shift mode patterns have higher transition test coverage than broadside because it is a simpler test for the ATPG tool to create. However much of the additional coverage is due to testing nonfunctional fau The c overage is similar to broadside once false and multicycle path analysis is performed [9  10 T o g e t a hi gher t e st co verag e  f o r atspeed test with fewer patter ns, the internal scan enable was implemented for this design so that both broadside and launch-off shift transition patterns could be used The scan mode select is cap_mode and it is configured per pattern and the value is loaded during shifting in of the other scan pattern data. When this register is set to 1, launch-off shift mode is enabled Table 2 shows a comparison of the pattern count required by the two types of transition patterns to reach 80% test coverage for this design  To get the correct va lues loaded into the capture counter and capture mode cells, the ATPG tool provides a method to specify those values when those cells are part of the scan chains. The way to accomplish this is to use condition statements within the named capture procedures Named capture procedures are user defined and tell the ATPG tool how the clock control circuitry around the PLL logic works. An exam ple is illustrated in Table 3 Within the named capture procedure are two modes the external mode describes the external clocks and controls from the primary inputs, and the internal mode describes the clocks and cont rols on the internal chip side of the clock control logic. The example shown in Table 3 specifies to create a 2 clock pulse broadside type of pattern because of the values specified in the condition statements Multiple named capture procedures can be created and used. To test for at-sp eed faults around the memories of this design, a minimum of 5 cycles is required so named capture procedures were written to accomplish that. Another way to test around memories is to use multiple-load patterns. To create test patterns more efficiently, the general pattern creation flow was to first run the ATPG tool with the 2 at-speed clock pulse named capture procedures on the whole fault list. Then to target the remaining faults to get the highest possible test coverage, turn on the 6 at-speed clock pulse named capture procedure Since the use of the on chip PLL clocks for at-speed test worked so well, this design can be tested with a tester that supplies clocks of 50 MHz or less instead of requiring a 200 MHZ tester. This reduced the cost of the test equipment substantially Table 2.

3. On-chip test pattern compression The Audio Processor will be taped out once but the die will be packaged into 4 different products. So only the common pins that are present in all the types of packages can be used as scan control and data channels 16 scan chains are all that are available. As seen in Table 1, almost 49,000 re gisters share these16 scan chains, so there are more than 3000 registers on a single scan chain in a standard ATPG scan setup With standard ATPG, it takes 1176 test patterns to achieve 96% stuck-at test coverage. This means that 3.81Mbit of data storage is required for each scan chain input/output pin on the tester. About 152.2ms is required to execute this test set if the clock shift rate is at 25MHz. But that’s only for the stuck-at faults! The patterns for transition faults can easily be 3X \(3 times larger than that Embedded Deterministic Test \(EDT\a non-intrusive DFT technology for reducing test data volume and test time dramatically [1 EDT accomplishes this reduction by applying a patented type of compression during deterministic test pattern generation. EDT also requires a small amount of logic on the chip that resides only in the scan path between the scan channel interface and the internal s can chains. This onchip logic receives the compressed test pattern data from the tester and feeds the scan chains. Then it compresses the captured responses on the output side before sending that data back to the tester to co mpare against the expected results The benefits of using EDT on the design are twofold It reduces the volume of test data that is required for the tester memory, allowing th e use of less expensive testers. Secondly, it also shortens the test application time and so higher tester throughput is possible than with traditional ATPG The way that it shortens the test time is by configuring the internal scan chains differently than in standard scan ATPG. With EDT logi c on-chip, the scan chains are re-configured to be much shorter in length. This creates many more scan chains, but that is not a problem since they only interf ace to the decompressor and compactor logic and not directly to the scan channel pins on the I/O. The tester still sees the design as having only 16 scan chains/channels but each is much shorter in length and the test patterns are loaded/unloaded much faster Figure 4 shows a diagram of how the EDT logic and scan chains were configured for the Audio Processor design. It used 600 short internal scan chains Figure 4,  Scan configuration with compression logic  As mentioned before, only 16 scan input/outputs are available in this design. 15 are used for EDT scan channels. The last one is used for the at-speed scan clock configuration, which was discussed in Section 2. This is optional because these scan cells can be made part of the regular scan chains The EDT logic can also include optional bypass logic to configure the many short scan chains back into 16 long scan chains. This used to be done for failing part diagnosis, but the ATPG provider can also diagnose compressed EDT test patterns too EDT requires 3 pins for controlling the logic. They are edt_clock  edt_update and edt_bypass They can be shared with functional pins. The normal sequence for these signals is shown in Figure 5 and described below In the load_unload cycle, the edt_clock pulses with edt_update asserted to clear the old stored data in the EDT module In shift cycles edt_clock pulses with edt_update cleared. The test pattern data is shifted into the EDT decompressor via the sc an-in channels. The decompressor calculates the data which is distributed to all the short scan chains. Th e captured output data from the previous pattern is compressed via the compressor and shifted out from the scan output channels In capture cycle\(s edt_clock is held to a constraint 0 the values on edt_bypass and edt_update are don’t cares To get the EDT logic created for the design is quite easy. In fact, there are three standard EDT flows that are supported: the external flow the internal flow, and the skeleton flow 600 scan chains 15 scan channels Decompressor Compactor 
242 


Figure 5.  Basic EDT signals waveform  The internal and extern al flows both need the core design to be at the netlist level. For the external flow the basic netlist core is without any I/O pads or boundary scan logic. Those elemen ts are inserted after the EDT logic is created and reside at the same level of hierarchy. If the design netl ist already includes I/O pads and boundary scan logic, the internal flow is used when creating the EDT logic. This will include a wrapper with the EDT logic and core inside Since the Audio Proces sor is a new design project the core RTL design was still changing when the DFT work needed to begin. B ecause of this, the skeleton flow was used. This flow al lows the use of a skeleton netlist as input to the EDT logic creation step as shown in Figure 6. The skeleton netlist only contains the basic design information such as the number of scan chains and their clock domains. With this information, the EDT tool is able to create the necessary EDT logic at the RTL level Figure 6.  Skeleton DFT flow with EDT The design team integrated this EDT logic into the design before synthesis and scan insertion as shown in the diagram. Compared to th e core logic, the addition of the EDT logic was less than 1 The use of the skeleton flow was a big advantage because the DFT work was started before the first netlist was ready. In addition, if the core netlist changes it’s not necessary that the EDT logic be re-generated Since netlist changes are co mmon in the design phase this was another considerab le cost savings to the project 4. Test pattern compression results The test compression results obtained were quite good. Table 4 shows the stuck-at test pattern volume comparison for the design with and without the EDT implemented. At 96% test coverage, 3.81Mbits are required on the tester for each scan input/output for data storage if the EDT logic is bypassed. With the EDT logic in place, this tester memory per pin requirement drops to 0.20Mbits NOTE: The coverage shown is not real high because we didn’t stress the tool and try all possible configurations for comparing convenience. We can get > 98% stuck-at coverage if we do so The test compression results for broadside transition test patterns was slightly higher and are shown in Table 5. At 80% test coverage, 11.62Mbits are required for each scan input/output for da ta storage in bypass mode while only 0.52Mbits are required with the EDT logic in place scan_en scan_clk edt_update edt_clock edt_bypass load_unload shift load_unload shift shift capture Create EDT logic RTL Design/Integration Design Synthesis Scan Insertion ATPG with gate level netlist RTL EDT Skeleton Netlist Scan With netlist Logic EDT Test Patterns Table 4.

NOTE: The pattern counts show n are both calculated for broadside mode NOTE: The coverage shown is not real high because we didn’t stress the tool and try all possible configurations for comparing convenience. We can get > 89% transition coverage if we do so By combining the stuck-at and transition test patterns with the on-chip compression logic, the amount of required tester memory drops to just 5% of the memory that would be required without the on-chip compression 5. Conclusions The Audio Processor ut ilized several DFT techniques to reduce test cost significantly. The first methodology was to add a small amount of logic to enable the use of the on-chip PLL clocks for at-speed test purposes Since the shift clock freque ncy was just 25MHz during test, we were able to use a less sophisticated, and much less expensive tester while still testing the design at its 200MHz operational frequency. Considering that a 1000MHz Pinscale tester is al most double the cost of a 100Mhz J750 tester, the test cost is cut in half by using this technique Another big test cost savings comes from the compression of the test patterns which require much less tester memory. For less than 1% logic area added to the design for EDT logic, both the stuck-at and transition test patterns take up much less tester memory as shown in the previous section. Since the design has over half of the total area consumed by memory, the EDT logic amount drops to under 0.5 of total logic chip area Finally, the saying that “time is money” is really true especially on the manufacturing test floor. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the amount of tester time required to test this design with the bypass \(standard ATPG\e compressed test patterns using the EDT logic Figure 7.  Scan pattern test time comparison The times in milliseconds to run the at-speed test patterns are shown on the left and the stuck-at patterns on the right. By using the EDT logic and test patterns we were able to dramatically reduce the test time per device and increase the through-put of the production test line 6.

The normalization constant  out was set to 20 and  in value was computed over the data set The remaining parameter settings were kept the same as the previous AC-ViSOM network applied on 2D Gaussian data set. AC-ViSOM’s visualization for this WBC data set was presented in Figure 11   Figure 11: AC-ViSOM’s visualization for WBC data set, dead neuron=34.5%, MSE=0.193   Figure 11 demonstrated that, AC-ViSOM was able to produce data structure preserved visualization with more active neurons in the map than that of ViSOM projected in Figure 10 for this high dimensional data set. Figure 11 also demonstrated that, AC-ViSOM was able to produce a better data representation justified by low MSE obtained compared against that of ViSOM The above experiments have shown that ACViSOM is able to produced less dead neurons for better network utilization, optimised data representation with lower MSE value, and appealing data structure preserved visualization as compared with ViSOM  6. Conclusion and future works In this paper, an extension of ViSOM was proposed by hybridising modified Adaptive Coordinate \(AC\ approach and ViSOM network as AC-ViSOM. Empirical studies have shown that, ACViSOM is able to eliminate the trial and error process of selecting suitable resolution control parameter of ViSOM. Besides, it is able to minimize the number of dead neurons in the map as well as optimise the data representation as compared with that of ViSOM. This better network utilization ability of AC-ViSOM has a potential to minimize the map size requirements to produce effective data visualization For the future works, the research will look forward to define a way of increasing AC-ViSOM inter-neuron distance preservation ability. The method on how to define a suitable initialisation process for the weight vectors to represent the data density information will also be investigated  Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Fundamental Research Grant Scheme 27\d Universiti Malaysia Sarawak for funding this work  7.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
