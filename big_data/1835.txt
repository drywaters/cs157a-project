Interestingness Preprocessing Sigal Sahar Tel-Aviv University gales@post.tau.ac.il Abstract As the size of databases increases, the number of rules mined from them also increases, often to an extent that overwhelms users To address this problem, an important part of the KDD process is dedicated to determining which of these patterns is interesting In this paper we define the Interestingness Preprocessing Step and introduce a new framework for interestingness analysis In a sim 
ilar fashion to data-preprocessing, this preprocessing should al ways be applied prior to interestingness processing A strict re quirement and the biggest challenge in defining Interestingness Preprocessing techniques is that the preprocessing will not elimi nate any potentially interesting patterns That is the preprocess ing methods must be domain task- and user-independent This property diflerentiates the preprocessing methods from existing in terestingness criteria and since they can be applied automati cally, makes them very useful This generic nature also makes them rare Preprocessing methods are very challenging to deBne We also define in this paper the first two preprocessing tech niques 
and present the empirical results of applying them to six databases The results indicate that Interestingness PreProcess ing Step is very powerful in most cases an average of half the rules mined were eliminated by the application of the two Interest ingness Preprocessing techniques These results are particularly significant since no user-interaction is required to achieve them 1 Introduction Builders of Knowledge Discovery in Databases \(KDD systems face the challenge of extracting interesting patterns from large masses of data Much attention has been ded icated to the development of data mining algorithms 
to effi ciently mine patterns from databases, for example As the size of the databases increases, the number of patterns mined from them also increases. This number can easily in crease to an extent it overwhelms users of the KDD process For the KDD process to successfully meet users\222 expecta tions an important part of it must be dedicated to determin ing which patterns are interesting to its users Characterizing what is interesting is a difficult prob lem Numerous attempts have been made to formulate the qualities that define what is interesting they 
range from evidence and simplicity to novelty and usefulness as in ll 18 10,27 1,4 17 15 8,221 Many distinct interestingness criteria \(see Section 3 are available to process mined patterns to determine which ones are interesting. Determining interestingness according to different criteria can result in different sets of patterns marked as interesting This dependence  of the patterns marked as interesting on the domain knowledge  is clear when domain or prior knowledge is used explicitly \(as in IO 27 12 19 
161 etc When prior and domain knowl edge are applied implicitly in the interestingness criteria this dependence is not as clear but still imposes a bias on the type of rules that will be outputted as interesting \(see Sec tion 3\This dependence should not be ignored 1.1 Contributions In this paper we introduce the Interestingness PrePro cessing Step and show through an empirical evaluation the powerful results of its application Interestingness PrePro cessing is applied to the list of mined association rules \(see the interestingness analysis framework in Figure 1 in order 
to reduce the size of the problem: the number of potentially interesting rules that need to subsequently be processed for interestingness The Interestingness Preprocessing criteria eliminate un interesting rules independently of 1 the data used in the mining process 2 the domain of the problem 3 the task addressed, and 4 the specific interests and prior knowl edge of the user Thus, Interestingness Preprocessing meth ods can be deployed automatically, without any human in tervention This generic nature of the Interestingness Pre Processing criteria differentiates them from the existing in terestingness criteria 
the Processing Step \(as in Section 3 In this paper we also define the first two Interesting ness Preprocessing techniques Since Interestingness Pre Processing methods do not impose any bias on the rules they mark as potentially interesting they can be run se quentially This generic nature makes Interestingness Pre Processing techniques rare To demonstrate the power of these techniques we provide an empirical evaluation of the results of the application of the two Interestingness PrePro 0-7695-1119-8/01 17.00 0 2001 IEEE 489 


cessing techniques on six databases. These results are very encouraging, yielding in almost all cases an average dele tion of more than half of the mined rules We stress that the Interestingness Preprocessing Criteria are meant to complement the existing types of interesting ness process criteria and not to replace them The Inter estingness Preprocessing Step is the first step towards the comprehensive solution to determining which rules are in teresting independently of the domain, task and user by eliminating some of the rules that are not interesting The rest of the paper is organized as follows in Sec tion 2 we provide needed definitions We review the avail able interestingness criteria in Section 3 and show the ex plicit and/or implicit dependencies of these methods on do main or prior knowledge We define Preprocessing in the interestingness analysis framework in Section 4 We intro duce the first two Interestingness Preprocessing techniques in Section 5 and present the powerful empirical results of their application on six different databases in Section 6 We end with our conclusions and future work in Section 7 2 Definitions and Preliminaries 2.1 Attributes and Association Rules Let A be a set of literals over the boolean domain An attribute is any one of these literals A set of attributes is a set A such that A C A An association rule is a specific kind of pattern that is very popular due to its many practical applications. Let A and B be sets of attributes such that A B C A and An B  8 Let D be a set of transactions over A A transaction is a subset of attributes of A that have the boolean value of TRUE The association rule A  B is defined 3 to have support s and confidence c if s of the transactions contain A A B and c of the transactions that contain A also contain B Given a support and a confidence threshold 3]\222s algorithm outputs the exhaustive list of all association rules that have at least those support and confidence levels For convenience we refer to A as the assumption of the rule A  B and to B as the consequent of the rule 2.2 Interestingness Problem Definition Definition 1 Let 0 be the set of association rules outputted by a mining algorithm run Eith support and conjidence thresholds of s and c Find R C 0 the set of 223interest ing rules 224 Definition 1 describes the general problem we are address ing finding the set of interesting rules Our goal is not to infer from rules in R rules that have not been mined i.e  We do not attempt to formally define which rules are \223interesting\224 that do not appear in R that could be of interest to the user This is the only supposition we make of a user\222s interests a standard one often made implicitly Definition 1 is stated as a post-processing problem a methodology with many benefits thoroughly discussed in 1231 Innovative approaches such as 4 and incorpo rate the interestingness measures into the mining process but to achieve that make assumptions on what attributes or consequents\are interesting In this work we introduce the first step towards the solution of the general problem of de termining interestingness, as defined in Definition l 3 Existing Interestingness Criteria and De pendencies on Domain Knowledge To determine which patterns are interesting one needs to determine which interestingness criterion to use. User pref erences to particular types of rules are implied by a user\222s selection of an interestingness criterion a selection often performed without considering the bias it imposes on the types of rules outputted as interesting The task of choosing the subjectively \223right\224 interestingness criteria for a specific KDD process is far from trivial Table 1 summarizes the use of explicit and implicit knowledge used to perform this task for different types of existing interestingness criteria The details follow in this section 3.1 Explicit Use of Domain Knowledge The KDD literature offers three main approaches to ex plicit use of domain knowledge The first and most popu lar approach proposes to have a domain expert or advanced user to formally \(even if vaguely\express on demand, using a predefined grammar, what he or she finds \(not\interesting or what a domain user already knows For example lo define templates of patterns that describe the structure of interesting rules  121 define generalized templates that per mit the expression of imprecise domain knowledge and 24 introduces user constraints  13 determine interestingness according to user defined actionability and 27 161 use user beliefs The success of these strategies is conditioned upon the availability of a domain expert willing to go through the often significant effort of completing this task The second approach taken in 25 constructs the knowledge base by having users classify every single rule This approach requires very intensive user interaction this time of a mundane nature and as the author says, \223may be argued to be   tedious\224 In some cases, the sheer amount of work involved in this approach may render it infeasible The third approach, presented in 19 is to eliminate a substantial portion of the un-interesting rules by having the user classify only a few simple rules This technique re quires very low-intensity user interaction Since its output 490

This indifference to orders of mag nitude may be exactly what a user is looking for How ever a user unaware of this property may fail to choose the subjectively beneficial objective interestingness criterion in hisher particular case The same applies to other differ ences between the two criteria, such as interest\222s symmet rical treatment of the assumption and consequent de scribed principles ranking criteria should satisfy and lists 13 criteria. More ranking criteria are listed in 20,4 For example for A  B and C  D such that confidence\(A  E  0.5 Pr[B  0.2 and confidence\(C t D  0.05 Pr[D  0.02  inreresf\(A  E  0.5/0.2  0.05/0.02  interest\(C  D However AddedValue\(A  E  0.5  0.2  0.3  0.03  0.05  0.02  AddedValue\(C  D 3.2.2 The mappings defined in Section 3.2.1 can also be used as pruning techniques Using a user-defined threshold, all pat terns mapped to an interest score lower than the predefined threshold are pruned or filtered out as not interesting Additional methods can be used to prune patterns that do not require the interest mapping criteria. Statistical tests such as the x2 test used are used to prune in 6 131 These tests have associates parameters \(significance, confidence etc.\that need to be initialized A collection of instrumental pruning methods is detailed in  These methods require the initialization by a user of several parameters \(error, strength, etc  present a novel algorithm that includes in addition to the two usual constraints of minimum support and confi dence thresholds two new constraints a user-specified con sequent and the second, unprecedented, constraint of a user specified minimum confidence improvement threshold Initialization of thresholds \(improvement 4 type-I er ror for the x2 test, etc.\implicitly requires users to use do main knowledge. Defaulting to commonly used values for example 95 significance level for the x2 test and even the choice to use the x2 test for pruning 6 131 as opposed to another method\are decisions that affect which rules will be outputted as interesting As explained in  the use of the x2 test requires conditions that do not always hold and thus, cannot be used in all cases There is also the acute problem of multiplicity when performing a series of tests at a given significance level the overall probability of mak ing at least one type-I error can be much higher than the predetermined level When using the x2 tests, one should also be aware of the type-I1 errors, since only a minute frac tion of the rules is expected to be interesting Pruning and Application of Constraints 3.2.3 Summarization of Patterns Several distinct methods fall under the summarization ap proach suggest a redundancy measure that summarizes all the rules at the given levels of support and confidence very compactly using the more \223complex\224 rulest Under the The preference to complex rules is formally defined as given rules A t B and C t D C  D is redundant with respect to A t B if 1 A A B  C A D and A C C or\(2 C A D C A AB andA E C

Are the 223more com plex\224 rules suggested in 2 to be favored over a summary such as the one suggested by 41 or  13 4 Interestingness Preprocessing The Interestingness Preprocessing Step preprocesses the mined patterns in order to eliminate patterns that can be determined to be not interesting independently of the do main user and task No information or user interaction is required by the Interestingness Preprocessing Step to per form this analysis, other than the problem definition Def inition 1 The Interestingness Preprocessing Step there fore precedes the Interestingness Processing and follows directly after the data-mining process as depicted in the in terestingness framework outlined in Figure 1 The Interest ingness Preprocessing methods do not impose bias on the rules they output as potentially interesting or on the nature of \223interestingness\224 in Definition 1 The Interestingness PreProcessing Step has several ben efits 1 First, and most pragmatically users can apply the Interestingness Preprocessing Step automatically directly after the mining process to all problem that conform to Def inition 1 This enables a significant reduction to every case of the interestingness analysis problem 2 Running the Interestingness Preprocessing comes with zero cost to users since these techniques do not require user interaction 3 The output of the Interestingness Preprocessing Step rules that were not filtered out during this step does not require appraisal by users as it is in other approaches, e.g., summa rization 4 The output of the filtering of the Interestingness Preprocessing Step can be used as the input for interesting ness processing methods, such as ranking summarization etc 5 The Interestingness Preprocessing Step circumvents the pitfall of a precise definition of what is interesting 5 Interestingness Preprocessing Techniques 5.1 Interestingness PreProcessing 1 Overfitting The first Interestingness Preprocessing technique we in troduce filters out overfitting by capitalizing on the basic characteristic of association rules the implication as cap tured by the confidence of the association The confidence value of an association rule is not the best predictor for the interestingness of the rule confidence does not take into ac count the a-priori probability of the consequent A rule may have a high confidence level, but this confidence value may be equal to the a-priori probability of the consequent ren dering the association rule meaningless Yet the confidence criterion captures an inherent property of association rules that may be exploited in some cases as detailed below Let the task to whose solution we are trying to approach be as defined in Definition 1 Interestingness Preprocessing Method 1 The applica tion of the first preprocessing technique to R consists of the deletion of any rule T  C  D E R if there exists a rule i  A  B E R such that I A c C 2 B  D and 3 confidence 2 confidence\(r Of course support  support\(r Verification To show that the method above is an Interestingness Preprocessing method we need to show that any rule that this method eliminates from R is an un-interesting rule as in Section 2.2 a rule that does not provide any more information than rules that already exist in R This follows directly from the definition of when rules are deleted according to this method We ex amine two rules TI 2 E R such that TI  C  D 2  A  B where A C C that is A  C B  D and confidence\(r2 2 confidence\(r1 In the general case given rules with the same consequent and assump tions that strictly contain each other not much can be con cluded without making stronger assumptions However when confidence\(A  B 2 confidence\(C  D the rule C  D does not provide more information than A  B since we are adding more attributes to the assumption A to form a larger assumption C and diminishing the predic tive power confidence In this case given A  B we can delete C  D as we wanted to show 0 Example 1 Given T  milkAshoes  cereal and   milk  cereal such that Pr[milk  0.8 Pr[cereal  0.6 Pr[shoes  0.5 Pr[milk A cereal  0.4 Pr[milk A shoes  0.4 Pr[cereal A shoes  0.3 and Pr[milk A cereal A shoes  0.2 r can be deleted by the 492

server Each transaction in the database specifies the cate gories of sites \(for example NEWS PORNOGRAPHIC etc a particular user browsed The database represents the ac cesses of the 2,336 heaviest users to 15 site categories Grocery Database We obtained this real-life dataset from an Israeli commercial company that sells groceries via telephone fax and the Internet The company has a list of approximately 95,000 items not all of which are avail able at all times In order to make the dataset more man ageable we chose to work on the 1,728 items that cover 80 of the gross income of the store We translated each transaction in the original dataset to one containing 1,757 boolean attributes 1,728 attributes describe the items pur chased, another 19 attributes are used to indicate different distribution centers in the country, and 10 attributes to indi cate the range of money spent on a single shopping basket Thus, the processed database contains 67,470 transactions each describing a single shopping basket its contents how much money was spent on it and where in the country the order was made Note the very large number of attributes compared to the number of transactions in this database Adult Database The Adult dataset contains 15 at tributes 6 continuous and 9 nominal which we discreti sized into 171 boolean attributes We used the 45,222 en tries in the original dataset from 5 that had no missing attributes as the basis for the compiled database we used Mushroom Database The Mushroom dataset contains 23 nominal attributes one of these attributes was an indi cator of whether or not the mushroom is poisonous\which we converted to 113 boolean variables We discarded the eleventh nominal attribute that contained missing values Thus we were able to use all 8,124 instances Nursery Database The Nursery dataset was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools It contains 8 nomi nal attributes which we turned into 32 boolean ones. There were no missing values for any of the attributes and we were able to use all 12,960 instances of the dataset Chess Database This dataset King and Rook white versus King and Pawn \(the pawn is one square away from queening on a7 has 3,196 instances and 37 nominal at tributes Each instance describes a single board position 6.2 The Data Mining Process We implemented the association rule discovery algo rithm aprioriTid and the rule generation algorithm in 3 The algorithm outputs all the association rules in the dataset that have at least the given support and confidence yielding 9,206 rules for the Nursery database 3 thresh olds yielding 8,314 rules for the Chess database 10 threshold, yielding 8,292 rules for the Adult database, 20 thresholds, yielding 13,906 rules and for the Mushroom database 35 thresholds, yielding 6,356 rules 6.3 Experimental Results 6.3.1 As explained in Section 5.1 the first Interestingness Pre Processing method relies on relative values of the confi dence, the predictability value of the association rules in order to perform rule deletion To demonstrate that this re liance does not translate into a functional dependence of the criterion on a particular choice of confidence mining thresh olds we applied this preprocessing method to the outputs of mining the databases using different confidence thresholds That is we mined each of the datasets using several differ ent confidence thresholds and the most permissive \(lowest support threshold our computational resources allowed us as detailed in Section 6.2 Results: Interestingness Preprocessing Tech 1 Figure 2 Results of the application of the first Interestingness Preprocessing technique levels We ran this algorithm on each of the databases de scribed above with the most permissive thresholds that the limited computational resources available to us permitted These support and confidence thresholds were as fol~ows for the Grocery database, 3.5% thresholds were used Yield ing 3,046 rules for the WWW database 6 thresholds For each of the six databases we applied the first Inter estingness Preprocessing technique to the list of rules out putted by mining the database with the given support thresh 494 


old as in Section 6.2 and increasing confidence thresholds For example, the WWW database was mined with confi dence thresholds of 0.06 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 and 0.9 using a 0.06 support threshold in all cases The results of the application of this preprocessing tech nique on the association rules outputted by these ten min ing processes of the WWW database are summarized in the upper left hand histogram of Figure 2 Each gray bar indi cates the number of rules mined using a specific confidence threshold For example, the first leftmost gray bar in the WWW histogram depicts the 9,206 association rules that were mined with 0.06 confidence level The black bar su perimposed on it indicates the number of rules deleted as a result of the application of this preprocessing technique on the respective list of rules, 3,793 in this case That is over 41 of the rules mined by from the WWW database us ing 0.06 support and confidence thresholds were deleted by Interestingness Preprocessing technique 1. This deletion is very significant considering that no information of any sort was required to perform it. This Interestingness Preprocess ing technique performed even better on the output of mining the WWW database using increasingly higher confidence levels deleting as much as 65 of the rules mined with 0.9 confidence levels, as indicated by the rightmost bar in the WWW database histogram out of the 1,503 rules mined the rightmost gray bar\977 rules \(the superimposed black bar\rules were deleted The other five histograms in Fig ure 2 summarize the results of applying the first Interesting ness PreProcessing technique to the other five databases The average deletion brought about by the application of the first Interestingness PreProcessing technique are 49.3 f 7.9 for the WWW database, 55.2 f 9.8% for the Mushroom database 69.4 If 18.0 for the Nursery database 57.7 f 7.3% for the Chess database, 72.6 f 8.6 for the Adult database and 3.7 f 1.5 for the Gro cery database These results are extremely encouraging a significant number in most cases an average of over half the rules outputted by the mining algorithm are deleted by the application of this preprocessing technique This is a significant result not only because of the large number of rules that is deleted but also because this deletion requires no information of any kind from a user of the KDD process 6.3.2 The results of the application of the Interestingness PrePro cessing 2 technique \(Section 5.2 to the six databases were more modest than those of the application of the first tech nique Even these modest results are very significant a re duction even of a small percentage of the rules is both ef fective and important when these results are achieved au tomatically without any interaction with any users The average elimination brought about by the second prepro Results Interestingness Preprocessing Tech 2 Figure 3 Results of the application of Inter estingness Preprocessing 2 technique cessing technique was as follows 3.3 f 3.4 for the WWW database 17.4 f 5 for the Mushroom database 2.5 f 2.7 for the Nursery database 3.1 f 1.8 for the Chess database 1 f 1.9% for the Adult database We present the detailed results in a graphical representation in Figure 3 for the first two databases 6.3.3 Results Sequential Application of Interesting ness Preprocessing Techniques As depicted in Figure 1, the Interestingness PreProcessing techniques can and should be applied sequentially We pro ceeded to do so applying the two preprocessing techniques we introduced in this paper sequentially The results of this sequential application are depicted in Figure 4 7 Conclusions and Future Work In this work we defined an Interestingness Preprocessing Step, as part of the interestingness analysis framework, that eliminates association rules that can be determined to be not interesting in a user-, domain-, and task-independent man ner The generic nature of the preprocessing differentiates it from the interestingness processing that do impose a bias on the type of rules outputted as interesting In this work we also introduced the first Interestingness PreProcessing techniques The deletion of un-interesting rules by these techniques is very significant since it is achieved without requiring a user to provide any informa tion Our empirical results indicate that these are powerful techniques in most cases more than half the rules were eliminated by their application It is important to note that any filtering power however weak of any preprocessing technique is significant since all the Preprocessing methods are deployed sequentially immediately following the min ing process on any set of mined rules and these results add up We hope that this work will encourage the development of more preprocessing techniques by the KDD community 495

 9 For instance, while in the “ISS Rendezvous Mode”, the function of actuating docking mechanisms might be disabled, and the firing of RCS thruster enabled. However in the “ISS Dock Mode”, the firing of RCS thrusters is inhibited, while docking actuation is available. On the left side of Figure 8 are the mode s from which entrance to the state is allowed.  Note that si nce there is more than one state from which you can enter the ISS Operations State”, the entrance modes called out may not all be in the same state Similarly, the exit modes on the right hand side of the diagram lead to modes in different states The spacecraft states and tran sition activities were then modeled as operational flows in CORE as shown in Figure 9 \(next page\e operational activities and their logical sequence are consistent with the Spacecraft State Transition Diagram shown above in Figure 7.  The operational model also identified the operational elements, which are tied to the physical hardware elements of the system that perform the operational activities Figure 8 Spacecraft Operational Modes  ISS Rendezvous Mode ISS Proximity Operations Mode ISS Dock Mode State Entrance State Exit S/C ISS Operations State From: Orbit Maneuver Mode To: Orbit Maneuver Mode From: ISS Checkout Mode To: ISS Checkout Mode ISS Undock Mode ISS Safe Haven Mode ISS Emergency Departure Mode From: S/C Powered Up Mode To: S/C Powered Up Mode 


 10 Figure 9 Spacecraft Operational Flow Functional Models After addressing the operational activities that the OSP system needed to perform, the functional models of the OSP system were developed consistent with the system engineering process discussed above.  The first step was to identify the physical hardware elements of the OSP system as prescribed by NASA.  The physical hardware elements of the OSP system were captured in CORE through component decomposition and represented as the product breakdown structure shown in Figure 10  Figure 10 Product Breakdown Structure of OSP System The OSP system functional models were developed by identifying the system functions based on the mission goals and operations that the system needed to perform.  These functions were then allocated to the prescribed physical hardware elements of the sy stem. As requirements and the system architecture evolved, the system functionality was re-allocated to different physi cal hardware elements.  In addition, the functional models also captured the physical interfaces between the OSP system, both internally and externally Interface Definition The CORE database also modeled and captured the interface complexity th at existed for the OSP system.  In the database a functional interface was represented as a collection of links that existed between physical hardware elements and an operational interface was represented as a collection of need-lines that existed between operational elements.  The links/need-lines were further defined by either  performance indices or constraints Internal and external functi onal interfaces were modeled within the CORE database by looking at different layers of the system physical hierarchy For example the interfaces between the OSP system and external systems were modeled as shown below in Figure 11, which depicts the interfaces that exist between the ISS Mating Adapter and ISS.  Internal functional inte rfaces were also modeled by looking at the interfaces that ex ist within the OSP System's physical product breakdown structure.  For example, Figure 12 shows the internal interfaces that exist w ithin the OSP System between the  ISS Mating Adapter \(ISSMA Spacecraft.

Therefore the OSP system had to meet the mission objectives using only existing technologies.  These existing technologies were introduced into the CORE modeling database as requirement constraints on the OSP system Requirements Management Requirements management was performed within the CORE database to track and perform requirements flowdown as well as tie the requirements together with the operational models, functional models, and technologies Requirements told either how well the system needed to perform, set constraints on the system, or defined the interfaces.  In the CORE database, all requirements appeared as either performance indices or constraints The customer objectives were introduced into the CORE database as originating requirements.  These originating requirements included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, guidelines, and standards.  Originating requi rements were then traced to OSP System Level requirements.  The OSP System Level requirements defined the performance indices and constraints at the system leve l.  These performance indices and constraints were then flowed down and decomposed into lower level performance i ndices and constraints at the segment level, element level, and component level.  This supported the development of the system and segment performance specifications and requirements traceability matrix All of the requirements captured in CORE were directly tied to either the operational model, functional model, or technologies.  If the requirement was a performance requirement, it was tied to either the operational or functional model through a performance index.  The performance index indicated how well the function or operation needed to be accomplished. The function or operation in turn was tied back to the hardware elements of the OSP system.  For example, the requirement for two days of contingency operations by the spacecraft while not mated to ISS was represented as a performance index exhibited by the “Spacecraft On-O rbit Operations” activity previously shown in Figure 9. The “Sp acecraft On-Orbit Operations activity was in turn performed by the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement set a constraint on the system, it was depicted as a constraint on either an operational element or hardware element in CORE.  For example, the requirement that the spacecraft shall have an operational service life of thirty years was captured in CORE as a constraint on the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement defined an interface, it appeared as either a performance index or constraint on a link.  For example, the requirement that the mechani cal interface between the ISS Mating Adapter and Spacecraft shall be the Low Impact Docking System \(LIDS constraint that was placed on 


 12 the “Mating Adapter to Sp acecraft Docking/Attachment Mechanism\(s\k previously identified in Figure 12 One of the challenges for the requirements management process was capturing the manmachine interfaces.  This specific challenge was to develop and implement a methodology that allowed operational requirements to drive the physical hardware design.  In CORE, this was accomplished by allowing performance indices tied to the operational model to decompose into performance indices related to the operational model as well as the functional model 6  C ONCLUSION  A robust systems engineering process is required for a large scale program with many interfaces.  The processes and implementation presented in this paper are ideal when faced with a rapidly changing requirements environment and dynamic interfaces.   Traditional acquisition of systems revolves around a rigid set of design-to requirements.   As recent history has shown, opera tionally based acquisition is on the rise.  This means that requirements are more likely to be in flux further into the program The C4ISR methodology and implementation presented in this paper provide a robust system engineering process for a large scale program with many interfaces.  In particular, the dynamic interfaces and the integration of human interfaces were handled through the development of segment states and modes.  The state transitions were driven by system operations.  This operations based systems engineering is necessary to understand large, complex systems The process was implemented using the CORE systems engineering tool.  A flexible tool such as CORE was required to build the custom schema required for this unique program.  The capability to rigorously define the dynamic interfaces as well as decompose those interfaces was required to capture the dynamics of operationally driven systems.  Functional and physical models responded to these operations. This implementation in CORE allowed for a “Systems of Systems” view to be modeled within the same database as requirements management The demise of the OSP and precursor programs cut short the full implementation of this process.  Given time, states modes, and then operational and functional models would have been built for all segments of the system.  In addition the end to end traceability from operational requirements to component design requirements would have provided a robust platform for system verification While human spaceflight is a unique problem, the issue of systems of systems” integration is present in many fields When this is coupled with human integration, the need for an operations approach is multiplied.  Determining how to operate a system after it is functionally and physically designed results in delays and cost escalation.  An approach that takes into account human interaction and operations at the outset is more likely to re sult in a system that succeeds throughout the program lifecycle 7  R EFERENCES    DoD Archi t ect ure Fram ework W o rki ng Group DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.0” August 30, 2003 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The primary development effort of the C4ISR CORE methodology as implemented on the OSP program was completed by Michael Wood, Orbital Sciences Corporation and Marge Dyer, Vitech Corporation 9  B IOGRAPHY  Staci N.

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
