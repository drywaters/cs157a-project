  1 Automated Cyclone Tracking using Multiple Remote Satellite Data via Knowledge Transfer Shen-Shyang Ho and Ashit Talukder Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology 4800 Oak Grove Ave 300-123 Pasadena, CA  91109 sho, ashit.talukder}@jpl.nasa.gov  Abstract 227Cyclone tracking using a single orbiting satellite in a continuous manner is impractical as it has limited spatial and temporal coverage. One solution is to use multiple orbiting satellites for cyclone tracking. However data from some orbiting satellites do not provide features as useful as other satellites in identifying cyclones. Moreover satellite data containing st rong cyclone di scriminating 
features may be affected by coarse temporal resolution and object occlusion. In this paper, we propose a knowledge transfer methodology based on a Kalman filter for cyclone tracking using multiple satellite data sources containing a mixture of strong and weak features. This approach minimizes the negative effect of coarse temporal resolution and occlusion if only the sa tellite data containing strong cyclone discriminating features were used. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of our knowledge transfer approach for cyclone tracking 12   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION

A cyclone landfall causes great devastation incurs fatality, and affects pe ople's livelihood. To identify and track tropical weather sy stem, the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center \(TPC/NHC conventional surface and upper-air observations and 
reconnaissance aircraft reports from field missions  These observations, however, are concentrated in the North American coasts and in Japan/Europe to some degree 1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09 25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1313, Version 3, Updated January 9, 2008 Coverage on a global basis, especially in under-developed and developing nations such as large portions of Asia and Africa is limited or lacking which results in disastrous consequences in many of these regions. In recent years some studies have used satellite images that are manually retrieved and analyzed to im prove the accuracy of cyclone tracking. This procedure is currently slow, tedious, and requires close analysis by teams of experts 
 Satellite sensor data from the QuikSCAT \(Quick Scatterometer\ission providing wind speed and direction measurement has been extrem ely powerful in identifying a cyclone, which is an \223organ ized deep convection and a closed surface wind circula tion about a well-defined center\224 3 of high sustaining wind speed. Recent research showed that QuikSCAT data could be useful in early identification of tropical depressi and earl y  det ect i on of tropical cycl  M o reover Qui k SC AT dat a  has been used in the three-dimensional variational data assimilation technique for better cyclone tracking and intensity forecasting [7]. Our recent work [4] showed the feasibility of using QuikSCAT wind measurements for automated cyclone identification. However, due to the polar 
orbiting nature of the QuikSCAT satellite, it has limited spatial and temporal coverage. In particular, the time interval between two consecutive observations of a cyclone is approximately around 12 hours. Sometimes the sensor can only capture partial measur ement of the cyclone due to the orbiting path. To alleviate these problems, one can use sensor measurements from multiple orbiting satellites However, sensors from other satellites measure different earth and atmospheric properties. These measurements are not as powerful in identifying cyclone as the wind properties measured by the Scatterometer on QuikSCAT satellite. For example, the precipitation rate measured by the Tropical Rain Measurement Mission \(TRMM 4 has been used to trace the cyclone tr 
ack manually either during a cyclone event or as a reanal ysis after a cyclone event However, the precipitation rate cannot be used for cyclone identification since heavy rain fall does not imply a cyclone event  In this paper, we describe our methodology \(first proposed in  for t r ansferri ng l o cal  spat i a l t e m poral  knowl e dge between satellite data from different data sources \(i enable robust event detection using weaker satellite data 1  3 http://www.research.noaa.gov weather/t_hurricanes.html 4 http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov

After that, we describe our methodology for spatial-temporal knowledge transfer Finally, we apply our proposed transfer learning methodology to cyclone detection is described in detail and we demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of our approach to cyclone tracking 2  R EVIEW  Inductive transfer or transfer learning refers to \223the problem of retaining and applying the knowledge learned in one or more tasks to efficiently develop an effective hypothesis for a new task\224 5 The key characteristic of transfer learning is that knowledge is transfer across domains, tasks, or/and distributions that are simila r but not identical. Transfer learning capitalizes on previously acquired domain knowledge or data model \(from other problems\to benefit the handling of current related task  Multi-task learning [3 n e fo rm o f tran sfer learn i n g  which attempts to improve generalization performance by 223leveraging the domain-specifi c information contained in the training signals of related task\224. The training examples from the related task, sharing a common representation serve as an inductive bias 6   Another setting of transfer learning is called the \223domain adaptation\224 [1]. In such a setting, one specified a source domain and a target domain such that the source and target distributions are different but are defined over a particular feature space. To put it in a simpler way, it is basically learning when the training and the testing distributions are different. A more specific setting is when the distributions are different but the conditional distribution of the label given the unlabeled examples is identical for both training and testing distributions. This is also known in the statistical community as the \223covariant sh ift adaptation\224 problem [2   3 CYCLONE T RACKING VIA KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER   We introduce the concept of knowledge transfer to overcome the issues related to using multiple data sources for \(near ing. Towards this end, we put the cyclone tracking problem into the knowledge transfer framework as follows The source task is \223identify cyclone from the QuikSCAT wind data\224. The target task is 223identify cyclone from the merged precipitation data from TRMM satellite. The task relatedness criteria between the source and target task are namely 1     on some \(cyclone\ in region The problem of using multiple data sources for a single target task can be studied in a general framework for transfer learning. For a cla ssification problem classifiers based on data from multiple sources perform differently as a variety of discriminating features are used in the discrimination process  2  5 NIPS 2005 Workshop \223Inductive Transfer: 10 Years Later\224 6 Inductive bias of a machine learning algorithm is defined to be the assumptions that the algorithm\222s pred ictions based on the observed data training examples\ are logical deductions  while the next data from s ource B is collected at time Task objective is identical 2  on the same \(cyclone\ in region is not equal s not equal Area 


Occurrence of consecutive strong/weak feature observations  The knowledge transfer process shown in Figure 4 can be easily extended to Scenario 1. For Scenario 2, knowledge transfer can be ignored when there are consecutive strong feature observations. However when there are consecutive weak feature observations, one needs to use the previous weak feature observation to make search region prediction for the next weak feature observation. In our current implementation, cyclone tracking occurs in Scenario 2. We note that the tracking performance is not affected as long  k z   210  210 1 1111  k x and 1 210  k P  The \223correction\224 process consists of 1  Computing the Kalman gain 1 1 11  210  210 212     RHPHHPK T k T kk  2  Updating estimate with measurement 1   212 kk k PHKIP   One notes that Kalman filter assumes that the posterior density of the state estimation and noise model at every time step is Gaussian. Hence, the Kalman filter is parameterized by a mean vector and a covariance metrics. Moreover, in a system described by a linear motion model and a linear observation model under the Gaussian distribution assumption, the Kalman filter achieved the optimal solution in the sense of least square error\o the tracking problem Detector A built using training data with more discriminating power must be as powerful as possible so that the spatial-temporal knowledge generated is useful for the weaker Detector B 2  Figure 3.

One direct effect of using multiple satellite data sources is a reduction in the temporal resolution of observing two consecutive cyclone event images from about 12 hours using a single QuikSC AT satellite to a maximum of 3 hours using TRMM and QuikSCAT \(and also the Aqua\ellites \(See Figure 3 Multiple data sources with either strong or weak discriminating features, and 2  In the next section, we describe our knowledge transfer methodology in detail 3 METHODOLOGY    212  k kkkk xHzKxx  3  Updating the error covariance 11 1 210    This knowledge transfer process continues as one tracks the object with two data sources, one with weak features and one with strong features.

  4 Our knowledge transfer solution leverages the strength of each remote sensor type for cyclone tracking. QuikSCAT wind measurement has excellent information for accurate cyclone detection but lacks sufficient temporal resolution each pass-through is repeated every 12 hours precipitation measurement on the other hand has excellent temporal resolution of 3 hours, but lacks good discriminative ability for accurate cyclone detection Therefore, we employ \(strong feature\kSCAT wind measurement for cyclone detection \(every 12 hours\and knowledge transfer to \(weak feature\MM precipitation measurement for detection/tracking \(every 3 hours\This solution therefore ensures a high detection rate for cyclones while maintaining fine temporal resolution during cyclone tracking  Figure 6 demonstrates the feasibility of the knowledge transfer-based tracking methodology using both Level 2B QuikSCAT data and 3B42 TRMM data for Hurricane Gonu reaching Category 5 wind speed le vel Ocean in 2007 for two days. It is the strongest tropical cyclone since record keeping begun in 1945 for the North Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. Hurricane Gonu is an interesting weather event as tropical cyclones developed in the Arabian Sea very rarely exceed the tropical storm intensity, i.e. becoming a hurricane Cyclone Discovery   Module  Kalman  Filter 223Predict\224 Search Region  Cyclone Location Prediction Precipitation > T6  TRMM  QuikSCAT  Kalman  Filter 223Correction\224  asa strong feature observation is measured within a reasonable number of weak obser vations. We point out here again that in our cyclone tr acking problem weak feature observations are more readily available and it helps to reduce the temporal resolution of cyclone tracking   Figure 4. Knowledge transfer between data sources cont aining strong and weak features  Figure 5. Knowledge transfer based on Kalman filter using QuikSCAT and TRMM satellite data Our automated cyclone tracking using knowledge transfer based on Kalman filter is shown in Figure 5. Initially QuikSCAT data is retrieved from the database or from realtime streaming information, and is input into the cyclone discovery module \(strong detector\to locate/identify possible cyclones. The cyclone location is then used to predict the regions that are likel y to contain a cyclone at the next incoming data stream retrieved using a linear Kalman filter predictor. If the next data stream is the 3B42 TRMM data, a constrained search is carried out around the region most likely to contain the cy clone as identified by the Kalman Filter predictor. This constrained tracking via the Kalman Filter predictor is especially important for the 3B42 TRMM precipitation data as it is not a definitive indicator of cyclones and is susceptible to high false alarms. The estimated search region localizes the region that is most likely to contain cyclone based on past cyclone tracks and hence the incidence of false al arms is minimized by a large margin. A cyclone is localized by applying a threshold to the TRMM precipitation rate measurement \(T6 = 0\After a cyclone is located in the TRMM data, the Kalman filter measurement update \(\223correction\224\s applied to obtain an estimate of the new state vector or the predicted location of the cyclone in the next TRMM \(or QuikSCAT\ion cycle after 3 hours 4 EMPIRICAL RESULTS

The region bounded by a black box is a region correctly identified as a non-cyclone region 5  C ONCLUSIONS  Knowledge sharing between different satellites is a challenging and as yet unresolved problem, and an efficient solution such as ours that ta ps the information from such disparate sources will greatly improve science data understanding in various domains in environmental and space science. To date, we ha ve tested our technique on isolated hurricanes. We aim to test our implementation over a longer time scale in a region where there are occurrences of multiple cyclones that will allow us to demonstrate the global tracking capability of our implementation  In our current implementation, the merged TRMM 3B42 data are used for motion/location prediction and cyclone tracking. In the future, we would like to deploy \(i\TRMM 2B25 swath data to construct a vertical profile of reflectivity for cyclone events to be us ed in a Cyclone Discovery Module \(CDM\for the TRMM data. We plan to include the TRMM 3B40RT gridded data with an hourly temporal resolution to further improve the quality and accuracy of cyclone detection and tracking. Further knowledge sharing will also include the use of MODIS atmospheric data from the Aqua satellite and sensor measurements from other satellites to further refine the detection and temporal tracking accuracy  We would also extend and improve our knowledge transfer methodology by replacing Kalman filter with particle filter This would remove the restrictive assumptions of Kalman filter discussed in Section 3. Furthermore, we would

performed with appropriate details Procedures for environmental impact evaluation are defined in Part 3 At the time of disposal of obsolete components of manufacturing systems, if the components are still active, or have some production capability, and are reused for other manufacturing systems, environmental impact corresponding to this remaining capability may be removed from the manufacturing system evaluation if it was previously included. If the disposed component is effectively used for another purpose, then some part of construction environmental impact of the disposed component may be subtracted from the manufacturing system construction impact In case of component disposal without reuse system value of the disposed component from current status until complete expenditure of its capability should be subtracted from the manufacturing system value. No generally accepted procedure for active system or component disposal exist, therefore it should be explicitly specified An environmental evaluation index shall be defined using the concept of environmental efficiency Environmental efficiency shall take the form of an expression \(4  Environmental efficiency = F \(System_value System_environmental_ impact 4  Explicit definition of a function F depends on respective use cases given in Part 4 of this standard. For example, one of the definitions is given as  Environmental_efficiency = System_value System_environmental_ impact  \(5  Where system value generally is defined as useful physical output or added value from manufacturing system operations, e.g. products themselves, product 2411 functions, or profit; and environmental impact is calculated based on system inventory data throughout the manufacturing system's life cycle by applying the method of Life Cycle Assessment. As system value and system environmental impact are calculated on different measure, the ratio of the target system environmental efficiency and some reference system environmental efficiency is valid for evaluation  3.4 Data for Environmental Evaluation To perform an environmental impact evaluation of manufacturing system, information concerning manufacturing activity is necessary. By clearly defining these information data items, it is possible to perform unambiguous environmental evaluation. The details of such data items and their data format are defined in Part 5 of this International Standard. Where generally accepted environmental intensity data for unit process are available, they are also given in Part 5 Many of the data related to manufacturing system definition and operation have been standardized already in related international standards. In such cases, existing standards are referred to and extended, as necessary Some examples of categories for essential data items are Manufacturing machine /facility \(machine tools, conveyers, etc Tool and jig/fixture Energy Materials Product \(definition, quality, function, etc 


Product \(definition, quality, function, etc Process plan Production plan Other production resources Environmental evaluation data \(intensity data, impact factors, etc  Using these categories of data, evaluation procedures for an environmental index may be defined. Using a commonly available data format, it then becomes possible for public organizations and machine/facility producers to publish information useful for generating indices of environmental efficiency. By relying on such public data with precise specification of data format and definition, reliable and unambiguous environmental evaluation may be realized  3.5 Evaluation and allocation of indirect impact The unit process model, illustrated in Figure 2, is designed for ensuring the consistency of each view summary impact of  manufacturing system view  and  product view   Indirect environmental impact model is defined in Part 6, for establishing the method for the evaluation of Indirect environmental impact and allocation them onto the direct impact of production The knowledge and best practice of cost accountings are to be applied to this part, such for measuring and evaluating the indirect environmental impact and allocating them to the proper direct environmental impact element  3.6 Model description language The data models for environmental evaluation method are defined in following parts Part 3:  Guidelines for environmental evaluation procedures Part 4:  Environmental evaluation index model Part 5:  Environmental evaluation data model Part 6:  Indirect environmental impact model For describing the data models for environmental evaluation method, a formal language is to be employed for providing the interpretable representation which is to be human readable and computer procurable   4.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
