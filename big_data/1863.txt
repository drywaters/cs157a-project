 Abstract  Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controllers FLCs have been widely employed in many control applications as they give a good performance and it is relatively easy to extract the type1 FLC parameters from experts However type-1 FLCs cannot fully handle the encountered uncertainties in changing unstructured environments as they use crisp type-1 fuzzy sets Consequently in order for type-1 FLCs to provide a satisfactory performance in face of high levels of uncertainties some common practices are followed including continuously tuning the type-1 FLC or providing a set of type-1 FLCs where each FLC handles specific operation conditions Alternatively type-2 FLCs can handle uncertainties to give a better control performance However it is relatively challenging to extract 
from experts the Footprint of Uncertainty FOU information and consequently the type-2 fuzzy sets for type-2 FLCs In this paper we will present a novel method for generating the input and output type-2 fuzzy sets so that their FOUs can capture the faced uncertainties The proposed method will generate a type2 FLC that will try to embed the type-1 FLCs corresponding to the various operation conditions faced so far besides embedding a large number of other embedded type-1 FLCs This will allow the type-2 FLC to handle the uncertainties trough a big number of embedded type-1 FLCs to produce a smooth and robust control performance We will show through real world experiments how the developed type-2 FLC will handle the uncertainties and give a smooth control response that outperforms the individual and aggregated type-1 FLCs 
I I NTRODUCTION ype-1 Fuzzy Logic Controllers FLCs have been employed successfully in various applications for more than 30 years Type-1 FLCs usually give a good control performance and they provide a method to construct control algorithms in a user-friendly way closer to human thinking Hence it is relatively easy to extract the rules and the type-1 fuzzy sets parameters from experts However type-1 FLCs cannot fully handle the linguistic and numerical uncertainties associated with dynamic unstructured environments as type1 FLCs use crisp type-1 fuzzy sets The designed type-1 fuzzy sets can be sub-optimal under specific environment and operation conditions however because of the changes in these conditions and the associated uncertainties the chosen 
type-1 fuzzy sets may not be appropriate anymore This can cause degradation in the FLC performance resulting in poor control and inefficiency As a single type-1 FLC cannot handle on its own the high level uncertainties therefore in practice the type-1 FLC need to be continuously tuned or alternatively the faced uncertainties are handled by a group of type-1 FLCs where each type-1 FLC is designed to H Hagras is with the German University in Cairo New Cairo City Egypt He is also with the Department of Computing and Electronic Systems University of Essex UK e-mail hani@essex.ac.uk produce a good response under specific operation conditions Type-2 FLCs employ type-2 fuzzy sets which include a third dimension and a Footprint Of Uncertainty FOU 
which provide additional degrees of freedom that make it possible to directly model and handle uncertainties  H e n c e  F L C s t h a t a r e b a s e d o n t y p e 2 f uz z y s e t s w i l l be able to better handle the uncertainties and will thus have the potential to produce a better performance than type-1 FLCs as was shown in   2 4   6 7  8   9  15  AccordingtoKarnik et al 3 a s t h e t y pe r e duc e d s e t o f a type-2 FLC is the centroid of a type-2 fuzzy output set for the FLC consequently each element of the type-reduced set is the centroid of some type-1 set embedded in the output set ofthetype-2FLC.Eachoftheseembeddedsetscanbe thought of as an output set of some type-1 FLC and correspondingly the type-2 FLC can be thought of as a collection of many different type-1 FLCs Each of these 
type-1 FLCs is embedded in the type-2 FLC so the typereduced set is a collection of the outputs of all the type-1 FLCs embedded in the type-2 FLC The crisp outputs of the type-2 FLC can be obtained by aggregating the outputs of all the embedded type-1 FLCs  In t h i s w a y  t h e t y p e 2 F L C has the potential to outperform the type-1 FLC as it is dealing with the uncertainty through different embedded type-1 FLCs It is relatively easy to extract the parameters for the type-1 FLC at different operating conditions from experts However it is challenging to extract the FOU information and consequently the type-2 fuzzy sets from the experts In this paper we will present a novel method for generating the input and output interval type-2 fuzzy sets so that their 
FOUs can capture the faced uncertainties In the proposed method for each input to the type-2 FLC and for each linguistic label we will generate a type-2 fuzzy set that will embed all the type-1 fuzzy sets used so far to represent this label under the different operation conditions While for each output of the type-2 FLC and for each linguistic label we will generate a type-2 fuzzy set whose centroid will embed all the centroids of the type-1 fuzzy sets used so far to represent this label under the different operation conditions By doing this we will generate a type-2 FLC that will try to embed the type-1 FLCs corresponding to the various faced operation conditions besides embedding a large number of other embedded type-1 FLCs This will allow the type-2 FLC to handle the uncertainties through a 
large number of embedded type-1 FLCs to produce a smooth and robust control performance In this way we will generate a single type-2 FLC that will handle the Developing a Type-2 FLC through Embedded Type-1 FLCs Hani Hagras Senior Member IEE E T  148 978-1-4244-1819-0/08/$25.00 c  2008 IEEE 


uncertainties that were handled by a group of type-1 FLCs We will show in the experiments section how this developed type-2 FLC will handle the uncertainties and give a smooth control response that outperform the individual and aggregated type-1 FLCs In 5  a s y s t em w a s p r o p o s e d t o g en er at e t y p e2 f u z z y sets through collecting data from subjects after which data statistics are computed and then the parameters of the type-1 Membership Function MF are determined using the data statistics The derived type-1 MFs are aggregated leading to the FOU which results in a type-2 MF representing a word The system presented in this paper is following a different approach from 5 w h e r e t h e p r o p o s e d s ys t e m w i l l a l l ow t o generate a type-2 FLC that tries to embed the group of type1 FLCs that were used under different operation conditions It worth mentioning that we are not trying to produce optimum type-2 fuzzy sets and FLC but we are trying to design good enough type-2 fuzzy sets and FLC that will embed the available type-1 fuzzy sets and FLCs and will give a good response in face of the uncertainties In the following section we will present the method employed for deriving the type-2 fuzzy sets for the inputs of the FLC Section III will present the method employed for deriving the type-2 fuzzy sets for the outputs of the FLC Section IV presents the experiments and results followed by the conclusions in Section V II.D ERIVING THE TYPE 2 FUZZY SETS FOR THE INPUTS OF THE FLC In 1 M e n d e l a n d W u h a v e d e r i v e d t h e uppe r a n d l o w e r bounds for c l and c r for the centroid A C  as follows  l l l c c c   1 r r r c c c   2 Where l c and r c can be written as follows  l c min c LMF c UMF 3 r c max c LMF c UMF 4 Where c LMF and c UMF are the centroid of the lower Membership Function MF and the centroid of the upper MF of the interval type-2 fuzzy set A  respectively Due to the limited space in this paper we are going to present the proposed method applied only to shoulder MFs such as the ones shown in Fig 1 and Fig.2 The same method can be extended easily to other MFs as will be explored on our following publications A left shoulder MF representing a linguistic label such as Low is shown in Fig 1a while a right shoulder MF representing a linguistic label such as the High is shown in Fig 1b In Fig.1a L corresponds the left hand limit for the left shoulder MF while R corresponds to the right hand limit for the right shoulder MF Our aim is to derive an input type-2 fuzzy set for each linguistic label that will embed all the type-1 fuzzy sets that were utilised under different operation condition to represent this linguistic label These type-1 fuzzy sets are associated with the different type-1 FLCs Fig 2 shows the shape of the shoulder type-2 MFs that could be used to represent linguistic labels such as Low and High  a b Fig 1 a The type-1 fuzzy set used to represent the linguistic label Low  b The type-1 fuzzy set used to represent the linguistic label High  Fig.2 The type-2 MF function of each input in which each type-2 fuzzy set embeds the used type-1 fuzzy sets For each linguistic label for every input we will calculate the centroids of all the type-1 fuzzy sets utilised so far to represent this label After calculating all these centroids we willendupwithamaximumcentroidvaluedenotedas  k i c max and a minimum centroid value denoted as  k i c min where k represents the linguistic label for the i th input In order for the type-2 fuzzy sets to be able to embed the type-1 fuzzy sets utilised so far that correspond to the different operation conditions we will refer to these as original type-1 fuzzy sets the type-2 fuzzy set has also to embed the shoulder type-1 fuzzy sets that will emerge from the original type-1 fuzzy sets For example take the Low linguistic label shown in Fig 1 where in case of having 5 original type-1 fuzzy sets corresponding to different operation conditions note that for each original shoulder type-1 fuzzy set each SL value can be connected to any of the 4 A values of the other original type-1 fuzzy sets  SL and A are the base values for the type-1 fuzzy sets shown in Fig 1a Hence we will have 4 emergent shoulder type-1 fuzzy sets for each of the 5 original type-1 fuzzy sets Hence we will have about 20 emergent shoulder type-1 fuzzy sets besides the 5 original type-1 fuzzy sets For the Low linguistic label the minimum centroid   k i c min for both the original and the emergent type1 fuzzy sets will be associated with the emergent shoulder type-1 fuzzy set formed from the minimum SL and the minimum A  while the maximum centroid   k i c max will be 2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2008 149 


associated with the emergent shoulder type-1 fuzzy set formed from the maximum SL and the maximum A  If we calculated the centroids for the original and emergent type-1 fuzzy sets then these centroids will represent a small proportion from the whole population of the centroids of all the embedded type-1 fuzzy sets that are present in the interval type-2 fuzzy set we want to derive This small proportion of centroids will lie in the interval between   k i c min and   k i c max Ifweshifted   k i c min slightly to the left to have    k i c min and shifted   k i c max slightly to the right to have    k i c max  then this will create an extended interval This extended interval will enable us to accommodate the centroids of the original and the emergent embedded type-1 fuzzy sets besides allowing room for many more centroids of other embedded type-1 fuzzy sets which can lead to a very good control performance as will be shown later Mendel and Wu 14  h a v e p r o p o s e d t o u s e t h e length of the centroid interval set to provide a measure of the extent of uncertainty in the interval type-2 fuzzy set In a similar manner we can propose to use the length of the centroid interval Div   k i c max  k i c min to affect the extent of uncertainty in the generated type-2 fuzzy set Hence we can relate the shift to   k i c min and   k i c max to be a fraction of Div so the higher Div the higher will be the shift to   k i c min and   k i c max and hence the bigger will be the extended interval to accommodate the uncertainties For all shift values till 1.0 Div  we will be able to embed the type-1 fuzzy sets original and emergent and handle the uncertainties to produce a good result For the marine diesel engine control application reported in this paper we have used Div/4 as it was found to be a compromise for the size of the FOU as the FOU will not extend so much beyond the embedded original type-1 fuzzy sets and at the same time the FOU will be able include further embedded sets to produce a good performance Note that when Div=0 and when all the SL and A values are the same there will be no uncertainties and all the type-1 fuzzy sets for the different operations conditions will be the same and the type-2 fuzzy sets will collapse to the certain type-1 fuzzy set We will denote k i c min as the minimum centroid found so far by extending   k i c min to    k i c min hence k i c min     k i c min  We will denote k i c max as the maximum centroid found so far by extending   k i c max to    k i c max where k i c max     k i c max  c l represents the left end point for A C  which is equivalent to the minimum centroid value of all the centroids of the embedded type-1 fuzzy sets and c r represents the right end point for A C  which is equivalent to the maximum centroid value of all the centroids of the embedded type-1 fuzzy sets  A s w e h a v e c a l c u l a t e d a s m a l l p r o po rt i o n o f t h e centroids population of all the embedded type-1 fuzzy sets we can still have many centroid values for other embedded type-1 fuzzy sets that lie beyond the current found maximum and minimum centroids i.e we might have smaller values than the minimum centroid found so far  k i c min ndwe might have also a bigger value than the maximum centroid found so far  k i c max  This means that we can treat the minimum centroid value  k i c min  we found as the upper bound for c l So c l can be smaller or equal than this value as we might find a smaller centroid value for another embedded type-1 fuzzy set Also we can use the maximum centroid found  k i c max  as the lower bound of c r  So c r can be bigger or equal than this value as we might find a bigger centroid value for another embedded type-1 fuzzy set From this analysis the following equations applies for each input i and for each linguistic label k   r c  k i c max 5 l c  k i c min 6 The centroid equation of a type-1 fuzzy set is written as follows   x xdx c x dx      7 Therefore the centroid of the Low type-1 fuzzy set in Fig.1a can be written as follows 222 1 3 32 LO W AASLSL L c ASL L       8 The centroid of the High type-1 fuzzy set can be written as follows 222 1 3 32 HIGH BBSHSH R c BSH R       9 For the type-2 fuzzy set representing the Low linguistic label using Equation 8 c LMFLow and c UMFLow can be written as follows 222 1 3 32 LOW Low Low LMF Low AL AL SL SL L c AL SL L       10 222 3 1 32 LOW High High UMF High AU AU SL SL L c AU SL L        11 Where SL Low and SL High are the least and highest SL values among all the original type-1 fuzzy sets representing the Low linguistic label for input i while A L and A U are to be found From Equation 10 and Equation 11 it is clear that  UMFLow LMFLow cc  Hence from Equation\(4 r c Low  c UMFLow and from Equation 3 l c Low  c LMFLow  Therefore Equation 6 and 5 could be written as follows 222 min 1 3 32 L ow Low Low i Low AL AL SL SL L c AL SL L        12 150 2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2008

shifted by  m This means that the calculation of  r c and r c could be simplified by shifting the symmetrical interval type-2 fuzzy set A  by  m to be symmetrical around a more convenient point like the origin as in 14  t o h a v e s A  as shown in Fig 4 In Fig 4 we have a symmetrical triangular interval type-2 fuzzy set A  which is centred around m and can be represented by the two points m+pl and m+pu and their symmetrical points around m mpl and m pu Soifwe shifted A  so that m=0 and  m=-m we will have s A  with thebasepoints m-pu-m=-pu  m-pl-m=-pl m+pl-m=pl and m+pu-m=pu  If we then used Equations 16 and 17 to calculate rs c and rs c of the shifted type-2 set s A  thenfor A   r c  rs c  m  m c rs  and r c  rs c  m  m c rs   Fig.4 Shifting a symmetrical type-2 fuzzy set to the origin to facilitate computation In case of the shifted symmetrical triangular interval type2 fuzzy set s A  that is centred around the origin as shown in the left part of Fig.4 we will then have m=0  A LMF pl A UMF  pu and from Equation 15 by substituting p=0 s=0 and q=pu we get c HUMF  pu/3 similarly c HLMF pl/3 By substituting in Equations 16 and 17 rs c and rs c could be written as follows 1  33 rs pu pu pl pl pu pl c pl pu       18 22  66 rs pu pu pl pl pu pl c pl pl   19 As we shifted the type-2 set A  by m to form s A   therefore we have also to shift k o c max and q max by m to have q smax and k o cs max  therefore we can write rs c and rs c as follows rs c  3 pu pl   k o cs max 20 rs c  pl pl pu 6 2 2   q smax 21 By subtracting Equation 21 from 20 we have q smax k o cs max  D           1 2 3 pl pl pu pl pu 22 By adding Equations 21 to 20 we have q smax  k o cs max  S  pl pl pu 6 2 2   3 pl pu  23 From Equation 22 it could be seen that pl pl pu 6 2 2   D 3 pl pu  therefore from Equation 23 S D 3 pl pu   3 pl pu  D 3   2 pl pu  24 Therefore we can see from Equation 24 that pu-pl  2   3 D S  and thus we get 3  2 SD pu pl   25 Substituting in Equation 22 we get D 6   3 D S                1 2 2   3 pl pl pl D S  pl D S 8   3 2  26 Therefore pl can be written as pl D D S 8   3 2  From Equation 25 pu could be written as follows pu  pl D S   2   3           D D S D S 4 1 2   3  D D S D S 8  3    3   27 Substituting the values of S and D from Equations\(22 23  it follows that pl   8   3 max max 2 max max max max k o s k o s k o s cs q cs q cs q         2 3 max max 2 max k o s k o cs q cs  28 pu    8   3     3 max max max max max max max max max max k o s k o s k o s k o s k o s cs q cs q cs q cs q cs q            2  2  3 max max max max max k o s k o s k o cs q cs q cs   29 To obtain the base values for the type-2 fuzzy set A  we have to shift back by adding m to pl and pu so that we can have the symmetrical type-2 triangular fuzzy set as shown in Fig 3\(b IV E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS Due to the limited space this section will report only on one set of experiments that deals with the speed control of marine diesel engines The experiments were performed on a marine diesel engine testing platform which is designed to realistically reflect the characteristics and operating 152 2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2008 


conditions of the marine diesel engines with the ability to alter speed load inertia and torque The platform uses the noisy sensors and actuators used in the engine with the ability to introduce the same uncertainty levels faced in the real engines In the following experiments we will compare the developed type-2 FLCs against the different individual type-1 FLCs that were used under the various operation conditions Both the type-1 and type-2 FLCs will have two inputs which are the error  e  which is the difference between the process speed set-point and the current speed and the rate of change of error  d   Both the type-1 and the type-2 FLCs will have only one output which is Manipulating Variable  mv  which is corresponding to the electric output to the actuator Each input will be represented by two linguistic labels which are Low and High  The FLC output will be represented by four linguistic labels which are Negative Large NL Negative Small NS Positive Small PS and Positive Large PL  The type-2 FLCs will be constructed through the various type-1 FLCs used under the different operation conditions of 20 40 60 80 and 100 full operation load A Control Surface Analysis The control surface enables us to visualize the unknown input-output mapping function articulated by the FLC which will allow us to analyze the response of each controller Fig 5\(a and Fig 5\(b show the control surfaces for the type-1 FLCs that were tuned to handle 20  and 60  of full operation load respectively Note that the control surfaces of these type-1 FLCs are steep and non smooth and especially around the set point where e 0and d 0 consequently any small variation of e and d can cause considerable changes in mv which means that the type-1 FLCs are vulnerable to uncertainties Moreover the larger the variations in e and d due to the uncertainties which can be associated with the change of operation conditions the bigger will be the disturbances to mv which can cause instability and destruction of the engine Fig 6a shows the control surface formed by aggregating the 5 type-1 FLCs corresponding to the various loads 20 40 60 80 and 100 full operation load this surface still shows the steep non smooth characteristic of the individual type-1 FLCs however it is slightly smoother than the individual type-1 FLCs Hence the control performance improves in face of uncertainty when aggregating several type-1 FLCs According to Karnik et al 1  th e t y p e2 F LC ca n b e thought of as a collection of many different type-1 FLCs where each of these type-1 FLCs is embedded in the type-2 FLC So the crisp outputs of the type-2 FLC can be obtained by aggregating the outputs of all the embedded type-1 FLCs 12  I n t hi s w a y t h e c o n t r o l s u rf a c e o f t he t y p e 2 F L C u s i ng the Karnik-Mendel type Reduction shown in Fig 6b shows a very smooth response as it is in theory aggregating the outputs of the 5 type-1 FLCs corresponding to the various operation loads plus many more embedded type-1 FLCs This smooth response will consequently give a very good control performance that can handle the uncertainties and disturbances as near the set point where e 0and d 0 small variations in e and d will not cause significant changes to mv and the response goes on gradually and smoothly with no steep changes The smooth control surfaces associated with the type-2 FLC have been shown in other previous work 1  a b Fig 5 a Control surface type-1 FLC tuned to operate at 20  full load b Control surface type-1 FLC tuned to operate at 60  full load a b Fig 6 a Control surface of aggregated type-1 FLCs b Control surface of the developed type-2 FLC B Representative Control Experiments Although we have performed many control experiments however due to the limited space in this subsection we will present only representative set of control experiments In the following experiments a set point of 1000 rpm was chosen for the marine engine testing platform We mimicked the real operation of diesel engines where in each experiment the controllers were allowed to reach the setpoint and stabilise with no load after which we began to add different loads suddenly to mimic the uncertainties associated with change of operation and load conditions It is necessary for the diesel engine speed controller to be able to deal quickly with the uncertainties associated with a change of load producing minimum overshoot/undershoot as large disturbances can cause damage due to the large size and high speeds of the engines Fig.7 shows a type-1 FLC that was tuned to give a very good response at 20  full load After the type-1 FLC was started and stabilised at no load its nominal operation load 20  full load was applied and the FLC showed a very  2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2008 153 


small disturbance and settled quickly to its set point However as the FLC encountered larger disturbances that were associated with the change of operation conditions the type-1 FLC performance deteriorated and it produced high overshoots and undershoots and it required a much longer period to settle back to the set point Thus as discussed before a single type-1 FLC will not be able to handle all the uncertainties associated the change of operation conditions on its own and therefore we will need other type-1 FLCs designed for other loads to handle the faced uncertainties Fig 7 a Response of the 20 type-1 FLC to load changes a b Fig.8 a Comparison of the response of 20  type-1 FLC with the type-2 FLCs without changing the load b Comparison of the response of 20  type-1 FLC with the type-2 FLCs with 100  load addition Fig 8 shows a comparisons between the type-1 FLCs that were tuned for a specific load 20  full load and the developed type-2 FLC that use the Iterative Karnik-Mendel procedure referred to as Iterative type-2 FLC Fig.8 also shows the type-2 FLC that use the Wu-Mendel uncertainty bounds method referred to as the Bounds type-2 FLC 16 The Bounds type-2 FLC used the developed input and output type-2 fuzzy sets and we aimed to verify that the difference between the developed Iterative type-2 FLC and the Bounds type-2 FLC is very small This means that the suggested method in this paper could be used in conjunction with the Wu-Mendel uncertainty bounds method to give even a faster control performance Fig 8a shows comparisons that were conducted with no load changes from the nominal loads that the type-1 FLCs were tuned for 20  full load From these comparisons it is obvious that the performance of both the type-2 FLCs the Iterative and Bounds type-2 FLCs gave a slightly superior performance to the type-1 FLC where the type-2 FLCs had less settling time while producing less overshoots and undershoots This shows that even with no load disturbance the type-2 FLC outperformed the type-1 FLCs under the loads where the type-1 FLCs were tuned to be sub-optimal Note that the performances of the Iterative and Bounds type2FLCs are very close that it is very difficult to distinguish both performances from each other The power of the type-2 FLC will be further demonstrated when the FLC is introduced to high uncertainty levels as shown in Fig 8b in which the FLC is introduced to a high disturbance of adding 100  full load It is obvious that the type-2 FLCs produced a robust response as it handled the uncertainty and recovered quickly with a short settling time while producing smaller overshoots and undershoots compared to their type-1 counterparts The type-2 FLC had handled the uncertainties and produced a good performance using a single type-2 FLC while the type-1 FLCs need various controllers to handle these uncertainties Again note that the performance of the Iterative and Bounds type-2 FLCs is very close The same results applied to various load and operation conditions V C ONCLUSION In this paper we presented a novel method for generating the input and output type-2 fuzzy sets so that their FOUs can capture the faced uncertainties In the proposed method for each input to the type-2 FLC and for each linguistic label we generated a type-2 fuzzy set that embedded all the type-1 fuzzy sets used so far to represent this label at the different operation conditions While for each output of the type-2 FLC and for each linguistic label we generated a type-2 fuzzy set whose centroids embedded all the centroids of the type-1 fuzzy sets used so far to represent this label at the different operation conditions By doing this we generated a single type-2 FLC that tried to embed the different type-1 FLCs that were used as a group to handle the uncertainties under the various operation conditions In addition the type2 FLC embedded a large number of other embedded type-1 FLCs This will allow the type-2 FLC to handle the uncertainties through a large number of embedded type-1 FLCs to produce a smooth and robust control performance Through the control surface analysis and through control experiments we have shown that the developed type-2 FLC can handle the uncertainties associated with the change of operation to produce a robust and smooth control response The type-2 FLC can recover quickly from disturbances with short settling times and with minimum overshoots and undershoots thus outperforming the performance of the type1 FLCs It was noted also that the performances of the Iterative and Bounds type-2 FLCs are very close for the control application Hence the Wu-Mendel uncertainty bounds method can be used in conjunction with the suggested method and thus avoiding the use of the iterative Karnik-Mendel procedure Our following work will report on the extension of the suggested method to different input and output type-2 MF  154 2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2008

execution Most of these approaches utilize some kind of state machinery for this Book and Gruhn present an approach to describe the dialogue by dialogue graphs that are enhanced state machines They present the formal semantics of the Dialogue Flow Notation DFN that provides constructs for the design of modular navigation models These dialogue graphs are on the same level as our composite statecharts describing all possible dialogue paths The dialogue graphs have to be speci“ed by the UI designer whereas our composite statecharts are automatically generated from the high-level discourse model ConcurTaskTrees are a w ay of hierarchical task modeling where different temporal relations among tasks can be speci“ed e.g enabling disabling concurrency order independence and suspend-resume Out of such task models the user interface can be created through several steps of model transformations CTT also allows the derivation of presentation units consisting of a set of tasks and their transitions but their transition graph is more abstract than our presentation unit state machine skipping detailed trigger events for the transitions Elkoutbi et al present an approach that generates a user interface prototype from scenarios Scenarios are enriched with UI information and are automatically transformed into UML statecharts which are then used for UI prototype generation In contrast to this approach we model classes of dialogues supporting a set of scenarios We are not aware of any approach that would generate the behavior of user interfaces automatically from a largely declarative high-level discourse model In addition to taking a communication-centric approach and modeling humanmachine communication in the form of discourses we generate user interfaces automatically including their behavior 8 Conclusion In this paper we address the issue of automatic generation of the behavior of a user interface from a high-level discourse model While the generation seems to be possible from a purely declarative model the complete behavioral operationalization is facilitated by introducing behavioral constructs into the otherwise declarative model We de“ned procedural semantics for both the procedural and the declarative constructs of the discourse model using statecharts Based on these building blocks for operationalization we showed how composite statecharts for whole discourse trees can be generated These directly de“ne all possible behaviors of a fully serialized user interface e.g using speech input and output In contrast for a graphical user interface with potentially in“nite screen size we showed a derivation of a nite-state machine from a composite statechart for de“ning its behavior The behavior of multimodal interfaces can be de“ned in the spectrum between these extremes In this way we have de“ned how the behavior of user interfaces can be automatically generated from a largely declarative high-level discourse model Taking this together with generating structural UI models enables the automatic generation of user interfaces from such discourse models 9 Acknowledgements This research has been carried out in the CommRob project  http://www.commrob.eu  and is partially funded by the EU contract number IST-045441 under the 6th framework programme References  C Bogdan J F alb H Kaindl S Ka v aldjian R Popp H Horacek E Arnautovic and A Szep Generating an abstract user interface from a discourse model inspired by human communication In Proceedings of the 41th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences HICSS-41  Piscataway NJ USA 2008 IEEE Computer Society Press  M Book and V  Gruhn Modeling Web-based dialog o ws for automatic dialog control In Proceedings of the 19th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering ASE04  pages 100…109 Washington DC USA 2004 IEEE Computer Society  M Elk outbi I Khriss and R K K eller  Automated prototyping of user interfaces based on UML scenarios Automated Software Engg  13\(1 2006  S Ka v aldjian C Bogdan J F alb and H Kaindl T ransforming discourse models to structural user interface models In Models in Software Engineering LNCS  volume 5002/2008 pages 77…88 Springer Berlin  Heidelberg 2008  S K ost Dynamically Generated Multi-Modal Application Interfaces  PhD thesis TU Dresden 2006  P  Luf f N Gilbert and D Frohlich Computers and Conversation  Academic Press 1990  W  C Mann and S Thompson Rhetorical Structure Theory Toward a functional theory of text organization In Text  pages 243…281 1988  G Mori F  P aterno and C Santoro Design and de v elopment of multidevice user interfaces through multiple logical descriptions IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering  30\(8 8 2004  J R Searle Speech Acts An Essay in the Philosophy of Language  Cambridge University Press Cambridge England 1969 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 


 11 This model specifies that covariates act multiplicatively on time t r than on the hazar d function.  That is, we assume a baseline hazard function to exist and that the effects of the covariates are to alter the rate at which an individual proceeds along the time axis.  In other words, the covariates z accelerates or decelerates the time to failure Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003  It should be pointed out that the distribution-based regression models for exponential and Weibull distributions in the previous section are th e special cases of both PHM and AFT.  This correspondence is not necessarily true for models based on other distribu tions. Indeed, two-parameter Weibull distribution has the uniq ue property that it is closed under both multiplication of fa ilure time and multiplication of the hazard function by an arbitrary nonzero constant Lawless 2003, Kalbfleisch & Prentice 2002, Klein Moeschberger 2003  2.6. Counting Process and Survival Analysis   In the previous sections, we introduced censoring and survival analysis models th at can handle the censored information; however, we did not discuss how the censored information is processed.  Accommodating and maximally utilizing the partial information from the censored observations is the most challenging and also the most rewarding task in survival anal ysis.  This also establishes survival analysis as a unique fiel d in mathematical statistics Early statistical inferences for censored data in survival analysis were dependent on asymptotic likelihood theory Severini 2000\ Cox \(1972, 1975\ proposed partial likelihood as an extension to classical maximum likelihood estimation in the context of hi s proportional hazards model as a major contribution. Asymptotic likelihood has been and still is the dominant theory for developing survival analysis inference and hypothesis testing methods \(Klein and Moeschberger 2003, Severini 2000\. There are many monographs and textbooks of survival analysis containing sufficient details for applying survival analysis \(Cox and Oakes 1984, Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980, 2002, Lawless 1982, 2003, Klein and Moeschberger, 2003\. A problem with traditional asymptotic lik elihood theory is that the resulting procedures can become very complicated when handling more complex censoring mechanisms \(Klein Moeschberger 2003\. A more elegant but requiring rigorous measure-theoretic probability theo ry is the approach with counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theorems.  Indeed, this approach was used by Aalen 1975\ to set the rigorous mathematical foundation for survival analysis, and later further developed and summarized by Fleming and Harrington \(1991\, Andersen et al. \(1993\several research papers.  In reliability theory Aven and Jensen \(1999\ dem onstrated such an approach by developing a general failure model, which we briefly introduced in Section 1.2. However, the counting process and Martingale approach require measure theoretic treatments of probability and st ochastic processes, which is often not used in engineering or applied statistics.  A detailed introduction of the topic is obviously beyond the scope of this paper, and we only present a brief sketch of the most important concepts involved.  Readers are referred to the excellent monographs by Andersen et al. \(1993 Fleming and Harrington \(1991\ Aven and Jensen \(1999\ for comprehensive details, and Kal bfleisch and Prentice \(2002 Klein and Moeschberger \(2003\, Lawless \(2003\ for more application–oriented treatments The following discussion on this topic is drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  A counting stochastic process N  t  t 0 possesses the properties that N  0 ro and N  t   with probability one. The sample paths of N  t ht continuous and piecewise constant with jumps of size 1  step function In a right-censored sample, \(we assume only right censoring in this section N i  t  I  T i t  i   which keep the value 0 until individual i fails and then jump to 1  are counting processes. The accumulation of N i  t ocess     1 t N t N n i i is again a counting process, which counts the number of failures in the sample at or before time t   The counting process keeps track of the information on the occurrences of events,   for instance, the history information such as which individual was censored prior to time t and which individual died at or prior to time t as well as the covariates information This accumulated history information of the counting process at time t is termed filtration at time t denoted by F t For a given problem F t  rests on the observer of the counting process.  Thus, two observers with different recordings at different times will get different filtrations.  This is what Aven and Jensen 1999\ referred to as different information levels or the amount of actual available information about the state of a system may vary  If the failure times X i and censoring times C i  are independent,  then the probability of an event occurs at time t given the history just prior to t  F t\n be expressed as  t T if dt t h t C t X dt t C dt t X t P F dt t T t P i i i i i i r t i i r          1     t T if F dt t T t P i t i i r 0   1    51  Let dN  t be the change in the process N  t over a short time interval    t t t Ignoring the neglig ible chance of ties 1   t dN if a failure occurred and 0   t dN otherwise  Let Y  t denote the number of individuals with an observation time T i t Then the conditional expectation of dN  t   dt t h t Y F dt t C dt t X t with ns observatio of number E F t dN E t i i i t              52 


 12 The process  t  Y  t  h  t  is called the intensity process  of the counting process.  It is a stochastic process that is determined by the information contained in the history process F t via Y  t  Y  t  records the number of individuals experiencing the risk at a given time t   As it will become clear that   t is equivalent to the failure rate or hazard function in tr aditional reliability theory, but here it is treated as a stochastic process, the most general form one can assume for it. It is this generalization that encapsulates the power that counting stochastic process approach can offer to survival analysis  Let the cumulative intensity process H  t be defined as   t t ds s t H 0 0      53  It has the property that  E  N  t  F t  E  H  t  F t  H  t   54  This implies that filtration F t, is known, the value of Y  t  fixed and H  t es deterministic H  t is equivalent to the cumulative hazards in tr aditional reliability theory  A stochastic process with the property that its expectation at time t given history at time s < t is equal to its value at s is called a martingale That is M  t martingale if           t s s M F t M E s  55  It can be verified that the stochastic process         t H t N t M 56  is a martingale, and it is called the counting process martingale The increments of the counting process martingale have an expected value of zero, given its filtration F t That is  0      t F t dM E 57 The first part of the counting process martingale [Equation 56  N  t non-decreasing step function.  The second part H  t smooth process which is predictable in that its value at time t is fixed just prior to time t It is known as the compensator  of the counting process and is a random function. Therefore, the martingale can be considered as mean-zero noise and that is obtainable when one subtracts the smoothly varying compensator from the counting process  Another key component in the counting process and martingale theory for survival analysis is the notion of the predictable variation process of M  t oted by    t M It is defined as the compensator of process   2 t M  The term predictable variation process comes from the property that, for a martingale M  t it can be verified that the conditional variance of the increments of M  t  dM  t  h e inc r em ents of   t M That is          t M d F t dM Var t  58  To obtain      t F t dM Var  one needs the random variable N  t  variable with probability   t of having a jump of size 1 at time t The variance of N  t   t  1 t   since it follows b i nom ial distribution    Ignoring the ties in the censored data 2  t  is close to zero and Var  dM  t  F t    t  Y  t  h  t   This implies that the counting process N  t on the filtration F t behaves like a Poisson process with rate  t    Why do we need to convert the previous very intuitive concepts in survival analysis in to more abstract martingales The key is that many of the sta tistics in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of the basic martingales described above The stochastic integral equations are mathematically well structured and some standard mathematical techniques for studying them can be adopted  Here, let   t K be a predictable  process An example of a predictable process is the process   t Y Over the interval 0 to t the stochastic integral of su ch a process, with respect to a martingale, is denoted by     0 u dM u K t It turns out that such stochastic integrals them selves are martingales as a function of t and their predictable variation process can be found from the predictable variation process of the original martingale by           0 2 0 u M d u K u dM u K t t 59 The above discussion was drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003 also provide examples of how the above process is applied. In the following, we briefly introduce one of their exampl es — the derivation of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator  First, the model is formulated as           t dM dt t h t Y t dN  60  If   t Y is non-zero, then               t Y t dM t d t h t Y t dN 61  Let   t I be the indicator of whether   t Y  is positive and define 0/0 = 0, then integrating both sides of above \(61 One get 


 13                     0 0 0 u dM u Y u I u d u h u I u dN u Y u I t t t 62  The left side integral is the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H t           0  u dN u Y u I t H t 63  The second integral on the right side           0 u dM u Y u I t W t 64  is the stochastic integral of the predictable process      u Y u I with respect to a martingale, and hence is also a martingale  The first integral on the right side is a random quantity    t H   t du u h u I t H 0        65  For right-censored data it is equal to   t H  in the data range, if the stochastic uncertainty in the   t W is negligible Therefore, the statistic    t H is a nonparametric estimator of the random quantity    t H   We would like to mention one more advantage of the new approach, that is, the martingale central limit theorem.  The central limit theorem of martingales ensures certain convergence property and allows the derivations of confidence intervals for many st atistics.  In summary, most of the statistics developed with asymptotic likelihood theory in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of some martingale.  The large sample properties of the statistics can be found by using the predictable variation process and martingale central limit theorem \(Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  2.7. Bayesian Survival Analysis  Like many other fields of statistics, survival analysis has also witnessed the rapid expansion of the Bayesian paradigm.  The introduction of the full-scale Bayesian paradigm is relative recent and occurred in the last decade however, the "invasion" has been thorough.  Until the recent publication of a monograph by Ibrahim, Chen and Sinhaet 2005\val anal ysis has been either missing or occupy at most one chapter in most survival analysis monographs and textbooks.  Ibrahim's et al. \(2005\ changed the landscape, with their comprehensive discussion of nearly every counterp arts of frequentist survival analysis from univariate to multivariate, from nonparametric, semiparametric to parametric models, from proportional to nonproportional hazards models, as well as the joint model of longitudinal and survival data.  It should be pointed out that Bayesian survival analysis has been studied for quite a while and can be traced back at least to the 1970s  A natural but fair question is what advantages the Bayesian approach can offer over the established frequentist survival analysis. Ibrahim et al 2005\entified two key advantages. First, survival models are generally very difficult to fit, due to the complex likelihood functions to accommodate censoring.  A Bayesi an approach may help by using the MCMC techniques and there is available software e.g., BUGS.  Second, the Bayesian paradigm can incorporate prior information in a natural way by using historical information, e.g., from clinical trials. The following discussion in this subsection draws from Ibrahim's et al. \(2005  The Bayesian paradigm is based on specifying a probability model for the observed data, given a vector of unknown parameters This leads to likelihood function L   D   Unlike in traditional statistics is treated as random and has a prior distribution denoted by   Inference concerning is then based on the posterior distribution which can be computed by Bayes theorem d D L D L D              66 where is the parameter space  The term    D is proportional to the likelihood    D L  which is the information from observed data, multiplied by the prior, which is quantified by   i.e          D L D 67 The denominator integral m  D s the normalizing constant of    D and often does not have an analytic closed form Therefore    D often has to be computed numerically The Gibbs sampler or other MCMC algorithms can be used to sample    D without knowing the normalizing constant m  D xist large amount of literature for solving the computational problems of m  D nd    D   Given that the general Bayesian algorithms for computing the posterior distributions should equally apply to Bayesian survival analysis, the specification or elicitation of informative prior needs much of the atte ntion.  In survival analysis with covariates such as Cox's proportional hazards model, the most popular choice of informative prior is the normal prior, and the most popular choice for noninformative is the uniform Non-informative prior is easy to use but they cannot be used in all applications, such as model selection or model comparison. Moreover, noninformative prior does not harness the real prior information. Therefore, res earch for informative prior specification is crucial for Bayesian survival analysis  


 14 Reliability estimation is influenced by the level of information available such as information on components or sub-systems. Bayesians approach is likely to provide such flexibility to accommodate various levels of information Graves and Hamada \(2005\roduced the YADAS a statistical modeling environment that implements the Bayesian hierarchical modeli ng via MCMC computation They showed the applications of YADES in reliability modeling and its flexibility in processing hierarchical information. Although this environment seems not designed with Bayesian surviv al analysis, similar package may be the direction if Bayesian survival analysis is applied to reliability modeling  2.8. Spatial Survival Analysis  To the best of our knowledge spatial survival analysis is an uncharted area, and there has been no spatial survival analysis reported with rigor ous mathematical treatment There are some applications of survival analysis to spatial data; however, they do not address the spatial process which in our opinion should be the essential aspect of any spatial survival analysis. To develop formal spatial survival analysis, one has to define the spatial process first  Recall, for survival analysis in the time domain, there is survival function   R t t T t S  Pr   68  where T is the random variable and S  t e cumulative probability that the lifetime will exceed time t In spatial domain, what is the counterpart of t One may wonder why do not we simply define the survival function in the spatial domain as   S  s  Pr S s  s R d  R > 0  69  where s is some metric for d-dimensional space R d and the space is restricted to the positive region S is the space to event measurement, e.g., the distance from some origin where we detect some point object.  The problem is that the metric itself is an attribute of space, rather than space itself Therefore, it appears to us that the basic entity for studying the space domain has to be broader than in the time domain This is probably why spatial process seems to be a more appropriate entity for studying  The following is a summary of descriptions of spatial processes and patterns, which intends to show the complexity of the issues involved.  It is not an attempt to define the similar survival function in spatial domain because we certainly unders tand the huge complexity involved. There are several monographs discussing the spatial process and patterns \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\.  The following discussion heavily draws from Cressie \(1993\ and Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  It appears that the most widely adopted definition for spatial process is proposed in Cressie \(1993\, which defines a spatial process Z  s in d-dimensions as    Z  s  s D R d  70  Here Z  s denotes the attributes we observe, which are space dependent. When d = 2 the space R 2 is a plane  The problem is how to define randomness in this process According to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005 Z  s an be thought of as located \(indexed\by spatial coordinates s  s 1  s 2  s n  the counterpart of time series Y  t  t   t 1  t 2  t n   indexed by time.  The spatial process is often called random field   To be more explicit, we denote Z  s  Z  s   to emphasize that Z is the outcome of a random experiment  A particular realization of produces a surface    s Z  Because the surface from whic h the samples are drawn is the result of the random experiment Z  s called a random function  One might ask what is a random experiment like in a spatial domain? Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\ offered an imaginary example briefly described below.  Imagine pouring sand from a bucket on to a desktop surface, and one is interested in measuring the depth of the poured sand at various locations, denoted as Z  s The sand distributes on the surface according to the laws of physics.  With enough resources and patience, one can develop a deterministic model to predict exactly how the sand grains are distributed on the desktop surface.  This is the same argument used to determine the head-tail coin flipping experiment, which is well accepted in statistical scie nce. The probabilistic coinflip model is more parsimonious than the deterministic model that rests on the exact \(perfect\but hardly feasible representation of a coin's physics. Similarly deterministically modeling the placement of sand grains is equally daunting.  However, th e issue here is not placement of sand as a random event, as Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\phasized.  The issue is that the sand was poured only once regardless how many locations one measures the depth of the sand.  With that setting, the challenge is how do we define and compute the expectation of the random function Z  s Would E  Z  s   s  make sense  Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\further raised the questions: \(1\to what distribution is the expectation being computed? \(2\ if the random experiment of sand pouring can only be counted once, ho w can the expectation be the long-term average  According to the definition of expectation in traditional statistics, one should repeat the process of sand pouring many times and consider the probability distributions of all surfaces generated from the repetitions to compute the expectation of Z  s is complication is much more serious 


 15 than what we may often reali ze. Especially, in practice many spatial data is obtained from one time space sample only. There is not any independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  How is the enormous complexity in spatial statistics currently dealt with? The most commonly used simplification, which has also been vigorously criticized, is the stationarity assumption.  Opponents claim that stationarity often leads to erroneous inferences and conclusions.  Proponents counte r-argue that little progress can be made in the study of non-stationary process, without a good understanding of the stationary issues Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  The strict stationarity is a random field whose spatial distribution is invariant under translation of the coordination.  In other word s, the process repeats itself throughout its domain \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005 There is also a second-order or weak\ of a random field  For random fields in the spatial domain, the model of Equation \(70  Z  s  s D R d  is still too general to allow statistical inference.  It can be decomposed into several sub-processes \(Cressie 1993             s s s W s s Z  D s  71  where  s  E  Z  is a deterministic mean structure called large-scale variation W  s is the zero-mean intrinsically stationary process, \(with second order derivative\nd it is called smooth small-scale variation   s is the zero-mean stationary process independent of W  s and is called microscale variation  s  is zero-mean white noise also called measurement error. This decomposition is not unique and is largely operational in nature \(Cressie 1993\he main task of a spatial algorithm is to determine the allocations of the large, small, and microscale components However, the form of the above equation is fixed Cressie 1993\, implying that it is not appropriate to sub-divide one or more of the items. Therefore, the key issue here is to obtain the deterministic  s  but in practice, especially with limited data, it is usually very difficult to get a unique  s   Alternative to the spatial domain decomposition approach the frequency domain methods or spectral analysis used in time series analysis can also be used in spatial statistics Again, one may refer to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  So, what are the imp lications of the general discussion on spatial process above to spatial survival analysis?  One point is clear, Equation \(69 S  s  Pr S s   s R d is simply too naive to be meaningful.  There seem, at least, four fundamental challenges when trying to develop survival analysis in space domain. \(1\ process is often multidimensional, while time pr ocess can always be treated as uni-dimensional in the sense that it can be represented as  Z  t  t R 1  The multidimensionality certainly introduces additional complications, but that is still not the only complication, perhaps not even the most significant 2\One of the fundamental complications is the frequent lack of independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process, as pointed out by Cressie \(1993\\(3\e superposition of \(1 and \(2\brings up even more complexity, since coordinates  s of each replication are a set of stochastic spatial process rather than a set of random variables. \(4\n if the modeling of the spatial process is separable from the time process, it is doubtful how useful the resulting model will be.  In time process modeling, if a population lives in a homogenous environment, the space can be condensed as a single point.  However, the freezing of time seems to leave out too much information, at least for survival analysis Since the traditional survival analysis is essentially a time process, therefore, it should be expanded to incorporate spatial coordinates into original survival function.  For example, when integrating space and time, one gets a spacetime process, such as          R t R D s t s Z d   where s is the spatial index \(coordinate t is time.  We may define the spatial-temporal survival function as   S  s  t  Pr T t  s D  72  where D is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidean space That is, the spatial-temporal survival function represents the cumulative probability that an individual will survive up to time T within hyperspace D which is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidian space.  One may define different scales for D or even divide D into a number of unit hyperspaces of measurement 1 unit  2.9. Survival Analysis and Artificial Neural Network   In the discussion on artificial neuron networks \(ANN Robert & Casella \(2004\noted, "Baring the biological vocabulary and the idealistic connection with actual neurons, the theory of neuron networks covers: \(1\odeling nonlinear relations between explanatory and dependent explained\ariables; \(2\mation of the parameters of these models based on a \(training\ sample."  Although Robert & Casella \(2004\ did not mentioned survival analysis, their notion indeed strike us in that the two points are also the essence of Cox s \(1972\roportional Hazards model  We argue that the dissimilarity might be superficial.  One of the most obvious differences is that ANN usually avoids probabilistic modeling, however, the ANN models can be analyzed and estimated from a statistical point of view, as demonstrated by Neal \(1999\, Ripley \(1994\, \(1996 Robert & Casella \(2004\What is more interesting is that the most hailed feature of ANN, i.e., the identifiability of model structure, if one review carefully, is very similar to the work done in survival anal ysis for the structure of the 


 16 Cox proportional hazards model. The multilayer ANN model, also known as back-propagation ANN model, is again very similar to the stratified proportional hazards model  There are at least two advantages of survival analysis over the ANN.  \(1\val analysis has a rigorous mathematical foundation. Counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theory form the survival analysis models as stochastic integral s, which provide insight for analytic solutions. \(2\ ANN, simulation is usually necessary \(Robert & Casella \(2004\which is not the case in survival analysis  Our conjecture may explain a very interesting phenomenon Several studies have tried to integrate ANN with survival analysis.  As reviewed in the next section, few of the integrated survival analysis and ANN made significant difference in terms of model fittings, compared with the native survival analysis alone The indifference shows that both approaches do not complement each other.  If they are essentially different, the inte grated approach should produce some results that are signifi cantly different from the pure survival analysis alone, either positively or negatively Again, we emphasize that our discussion is still a pure conjecture at this stage   3   B RIEF C ASE R EVIEW OF S URVIVAL A NALYSIS A PPLICATIONS     3.1. Applications Found in IEEE Digital Library  In this section, we briefly review the papers found in the IEEE digital library w ith the keyword of survival analysis  search. The online search was conducted in the July of 2007, and we found about 40 papers in total. There were a few biomedical studies among the 40 survival-analysis papers published in IEEE publications. These are largely standard biomedical applications and we do not discuss these papers, for obvious reasons  Mazzuchi et al. \(1989\m ed to be the first to actively  advocate the use of Cox's \(1 972\ proportional hazards model \(PHM\in engineering re liability.  They quoted Cox's 1972\ original words industrial reliability studies and medical studies to show Cox's original motivation Mazzuchi et al \(1989 while this model had a significant impact on the biom edical field, it has received little attention in the reliability literature Nearly two decades after the introducti on paper of Mazzuchi et al 1989\ears that little significant changes have occurred in computer science and IEEE related engineering fields with regard to the proportional hazards models and survival analysis as a whole  Stillman et al. \(1995\used survival analysis to analyze the data for component maintenance and replacement programs Reineke et al. \(1998 ducted a similar study for determining the optimal maintenance by simulating a series system of four components Berzuini and Larizza \(1996 integrated time-series modeling with survival analysis for medical monitoring.  Kauffman and Wang \(2002\analyzed the Internet firm su rvival data from IPO \(initial public offer to business shutdown events, with survival analysis models  Among the 40 survival analysis papers, which we obtained from online search of the IEEE digital library, significant percentage is the integration of survival analysis with artificial neural networks \(ANN In many of these studies the objective was to utilize ANN to modeling fitting or parameter estimation for survival analysis.  The following is an incomplete list of the major ANN survival analysis integration papers found in IEEE digital library, Arsene et 2006 Eleuteri et al. \(2003\oa and Wong \(2001\,  Mani et al 1999\ The parameter estimation in survival analysis is particular complex due to the requirements for processing censored observations. Therefore, approach such as ANN and Bayesian statistics may be helpful to deal with the complexity. Indeed, Bayesian survival analysis has been expanded significantly in recent years \(Ibrahim, et al. 2005  We expect that evolutionary computing will be applied to survival analysis, in similar way to ANN and Bayesian approaches  With regard to the application of ANN to survival analysis we suggest three cautions: \(1\he integrated approach should preserve the capability to process censoring otherwise, survival analysis loses its most significant advantage. \(2\ Caution should be taken when the integrated approach changes model struct ure because most survival analysis models, such as Cox's proportional hazards models and accelerated failure time models, are already complex nonlinear models with built-in failure mechanisms.  The model over-fitting may cause model identifiability  problems, which could be very subtle and hard to resolve 3\he integrated approach does not produce significant improvement in terms of model fitting or other measurements, which seemed to be the case in majority of the ANN approach to survival analysis, then the extra complication should certainly be avoided. Even if there is improvement, one should still take caution with the censor handling and model identifiability issues previously mentioned in \(1\ and \(2  3.2. Selected Papers Found in MMR-2004  In the following, we briefly review a few survival analysis related studies presented in a recent International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Reliability, MMR 2004 \(Wilson et al. 2005  Pena and Slate \(2005\ddressed the dynamic reliability Both reliability and survival times are more realistically described with dynamic models. Dynamic models generally refer to the models that incorporate the impact of actions or interventions as well as thei r accumulative history, which 


 17 can be monitored \(Pena and Slate 2005\he complexity is obviously beyond simple regression models, since the dependence can play a crucial ro le. For example, in a loadsharing network system, failure of a node will increase the loads of other nodes and influences their failures  Duchesne \(2005\uggested incorporating usage accumulation information into the regression models in survival analysis.  To simplify the model building Duchesne \(2005\umes that the usage can be represented with a single time-dependent covariate.  Besides reviewing the hazard-based regression models, which are common in survival analysis, Duchesne 2005\viewed three classes of less commonly used regression models: models based on transfer functionals, models based on internal wear and the so-called collapsible models. The significance of these regression models is that they expand reliability modeling to two dimensions. One dimension is the calendar time and the other is the usage accumulation.  Jin \(2005\ reviewed the recent development in statisti cal inference for accelerated failure time \(AFT\odel and the linear transformation models that include Cox proportional hazards model and proportional odds models as special cases. Two approaches rank-based approach and l east-squares approach were reviewed in Jin \(2005\. Osbo rn \(2005\d a case study of utilizing the remote diagnostic data from embedded sensors to predict system aging or degradation.  This example should indicate the potential of survival analysis and competing risks analysis in the prognostic and health management PHM\ since the problem Osborn \(2005 addressed is very similar to PHM. The uses of embedded sensors to monitor the health of complex systems, such as power plants, automobile, medical equipment, and aircraft engine, are common. The main uses for these sensor data are real time assessment of th e system health and detection of the problems that need immediate attention.  Of interest is the utilization of those remote diagnostic data, in combination with historical reliability data, for modeling the system aging or degradation. The biggest challenge with this task is the proper transformation of wear  time The wear is not only influenced by internal \(temperature, oil pressures etc\xternal covariates ambient temperature, air pressure, etc\, but also different each time   4  S UMMARY AND P ERSPECTIVE   4.1. Summary  Despite the common foundation with traditional reliability theory, such as the same probability definitions for survival function  S  t  and reliability  R  t  i.e  S  t  R  t well as the hazards function the exact same term and definition are used in both fields\rvival analysis has not achieved similar success in the field of reliability as in biomedicine The applications of survival analysis seem still largely limited to the domain of biomedicine.  Even in the sister fields of biomedicine such as biology and ecology, few applications have been conducted \(Ma 1997, Ma and Bechinski 2008\ the engin eering fields, the Meeker and Escobar \(1998\ monograph, as well as the Klein and Goel 1992\ to be the most comprehensive treatments  In Section 2, we reviewed the essential concepts and models of survival analysis. In Section 3, we briefly reviewed some application cases of survival analysis in engineering reliability.  In computer science, survival analysis seems to be still largely unknown.  We believe that the potential of survival analysis in computer science is much broader than network and/or software reliability alone. Before suggesting a few research topics, we no te two additional points  First, in this article, we exclusively focused on univariate survival analysis. There are two other related fields: one is competing risks analysis and the other is multivariate survival analysis The relationship between multivariate survival analysis and survival analysis is similar to that between multivariate statistical analysis and mathematical statistics.  The difference is that the extension from univariate to multivariate in survival analysis has been much more difficult than the developm ent of multivariate analysis because of \(1\rvation cens oring, and \(2\pendency which is much more complex when multivariate normal distribution does not hold in survival data.  On the other hand, the two essential differences indeed make multivariate survival analysis unique and ex tremely useful for analyzing and modeling time-to-event data. In particular, the advantages of multivariate survival analysis in addressing the dependency issue are hardly matched by any other statistical method.  We discuss competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis in separate articles \(Ma and Krings 2008a, b, & c  The second point we wish to note is: if we are asked to point out the counterpart of survival analysis model in reliability theory, we would suggest the shock or damage model.   The shock model has an even longer history than survival analysis and the simplest shock model is the Poisson process model that leads to exponential failure rate model The basic assumption of the shock model is the notion that engineered systems endure some type of wear, fatigue or damage, which leads to the failure when the strengths exceed the tolerance limits of th e system \(Nakagawa 2006 There are extensive research papers on shock models in the probability theory literature, but relatively few monographs The monograph by Nakagawa \(2006\s to be the latest The shock model is often formulated as a Renewal stochastic process or point process with Martingale theory The rigorous mathematical derivation is very similar to that of survival analysis from counting stochastic processes  which we briefly outlined in section 2.6  It is beyond the scope of the paper to compare the shock model with survival analysis; however, we would like to make the two specific comments. \(1\Shock models are essentially the stochastic process model to capture the failure mechanism based on the damage induced on the system by shocks, and the resulting statistical models are 


 18 often the traditional reliability distribution models such as exponential and Weibull failure distributions.  Survival analysis does not depend on specific shock or damage Instead, it models the failure with abstract time-to-event random variables.  Less restrictive assumptions with survival analysis might be more useful for modeling software reliability where the notions of fatigue, wear and damage apparently do not apply.  \(2\hock models do not deal with information censoring, the trademark of failure time data.  \(3\ Shock models, perhaps due to mathematical complexity, have not been applied widely in engineering reliability yet.  In contrast, the applications of survival analysis in biomedical fields are much extensive.  While there have been about a dozen monographs on survival analysis available, few books on shock models have been published.  We believe that survival analysis and shock models are complementary, a nd both are very needed for reliability analysis, with shock model more focused on failure mechanisms and the survival analysis on data analysis and modeling  4.2. Perspective   Besides traditional industrial and hardware reliability fields we suggest that the following fields may benefit from survival analysis  Software reliability Survival analysis is not based on the assumptions of wear, fatigue, or damage, as in traditional reliability theory.  This seems close to software reliability paradigm. The single biggest challenge in applying above discussed approaches to softwa re systems is the requirement for a new metric that is able to replace the survival time variable in survival analysis. This "time" counterpart needs to be capable of characterizing the "vulnerability" of software components or the system, or the distance to the next failure event. In other words, this software metric should represent the metric-to-event, similar to time-toevent random variable in survival analysis.  We suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(Li and Vitanyi 1997\n be a promising candidate. Once the metric-to-event issue is resolved, survival analysis, both univariate and multivariate survival analysis can be applied in a relative straightforward manner. We suggest that the shared frailty models are most promising because we believ e latent behavior can be captured with the shared fra ilty \(Ma and Krings 2008b  There have been a few applications of univariate survival analysis in software reliability modeling, including examples in Andersen et al.'s \(1995\ classical monograph However, our opinion is that without the fundamental shift from time-to-event to new metric-to-event, the success will be very limited. In software engineering, there is an exception to our claim, which is the field of software test modeling, where time variable may be directly used in survival analysis modeling  Modeling Survivability of Computer Networks As described in Subsection 2.3, random censoring may be used to model network survivability.  This modeling scheme is particularly suitable for wireless sensor network, because 1\ of the population nature of wireless nodes and \(2\ the limited lifetime of the wireless nodes.  Survival analysis has been advanced by the needs in biomedical and public health research where population is th e basic unit of observation As stated early, a sensor networ k is analogically similar to a biological population. Furthermore, both organisms and wireless nodes are of limited lifetimes. A very desirable advantage of survival analysis is that one can develop a unified mathematical model for both the reliability and survivability of a wireless sensor network \(Krings and Ma 2006  Prognostic and Health Management in Military Logistics PHM involves extensive modeling analysis related to reliability, life predictions, failure analysis, burnin elimination and testing, quality control modeling, etc Survival analysis may provide very promising new tools Survival analysis should be able to provide alternatives to the currently used mathematical tools such as ANN, genetic algorithms, and Fuzzy logic.  The advantage of survival analysis over the other alternatives lies in its unique capability to handle information censoring.  In PHM and other logistics management modeling, information censoring is a near universal phenomenon. Survival analysis should provide new insights and modeling solutions   5  R EFERENCES   Aalen, O.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
