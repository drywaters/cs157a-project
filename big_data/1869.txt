Geophone is a specific sensor in geophysical exploration. The geophone tester is mainly used to test the performance parameters of geophone such as DC resistance natural frequency, damping coefficient, sensitivity, distortion and so on. Some domestic testers are big, low precision and high power consumption and not suitable for outdoors. The testers abroad are expensive and their performances are not stable. This paper designs a high performance-cost ratio tester based on FPGA. It adopts EDA technology and programmable Cyclone II series FPGA on the platforms of DSP_Builder and Quartus II On the FPGA, there integrates 24-bit data collector, FIR filter, 32 
points FFT,UART and etc. Some testing experaments are fulfilled and the results show that this portable tester is of high precision, low power, and it is easy to be upgraded and maintained 
s are  high, so they are not adopt to use in the field. The other are based on the technology of DDS and ARM, which have low power and small size, but they cost much and their precision are not high. Although the testers overseas have high precision, but they have small memory and too high price. In the high temperature environment, some of them are easily to be halted and damaged, which may lead to waste [2  This paper designs a portable tester with high precision based on FPGA and isp technology refering on the products at home and abroad

B. Polarity and DC Resistance Testing

The geophone bunch must be connected in the homopolar way in order to get the best testing effect. Polarity testing is to obtain the positive and negative electrode of geophone. In the polarity testing, firstly, knock on the Geophone, then the tester samples the signal outputing form the Geophone continuously and analyse the data. As shown in Fig. 3, if the signal is higher

than a threshold and keeps high longer than a minimal period we can judge the polarity of tester by different sounds a\ That of positive polarity.     \(b\ That of negative polarity Fig. 3  Response signals in polarity testing In direct current \(DC\istance testing, a invariable current is firstly loaded to a standard resistance R and we test its output voltage V out 1 then the same current is acted on the geophone controled by  relay and then we measure the output voltage V out2 when it is stable. We can get DC resistance R s from \(1\5   R V V R out out s   1 2 1 C. Testing of Natural Frequency, Damping Coefficient Sensitivity The coils of Geophone will cut the magnetic line of force when they are moving, and then the electro motive force will be generated at both ends of coils. On the other hand, the coils plcaed in magnetic field will moving if there is current in them. So if a impulse current acts on the coils, the answer signal produced by geophone is related to natural frequency,damping coefficient, sensitivity and equivalent mass of the moving coils [6  When testing, firstly, a pulse current of certain wide about 40 percentage of natural frequency\ is impulsed on geophone. Thus the coils will attenuate and oscillate at the law of sines in the magnetic field, we can get the response curve as shown in Fig. 4. In the figure A 1 indicates the amplitude of the first peak of the voltage A 2 indicates the amplitude of the second peak T indicates the first zero-crossing point time Fig. 4  Pulse response curve of the tester By using A 1  A 2 and T acquired through testing, We can get natural frequency f 0 damping coefficient B t sensitivity G s 5\ [7       ln arctan 2 1 A A  2     ln    ln sin 2 1 2 2 2 1 A A A A B t      3  1 2  1 2 0 t B T f   4  tan  xp  2 1 0          e I A m f G s 5 In these formulas I indicates the current flowing through the coils m indicates the qualit y of inertia block D.  Distortion Testing Because the coils of geophone are not installed at the central position of magnetic field, its parameters will have slight nolinear and its output will nolinear too, this is called response distortion. In distortion testing, a standard sine signal of certain frequency is acted on the geophone, and we sample output signal with 32 points per period. We process these data by using FFT and get amplitude value of each harmonic such as A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 and so on. Finally we can get distortion by calculating the percentage of fundamental wave and harmonic wave by using \(6 7   100 1 2 5 2 4 2 3 2 2          A A A A A G t 6 IV.

ADC Sampling Sequential Control The analog-digital converter \(ADC\ed in the tester is 24 bit high precision ADS1252 of TI corporation Accroding to the requirement  of conversion timing, we design the system by using mixed programming based on VHDL language and graphics mode at the environment of FPGA.

Digital Filter Designing The siganl acquired by tester should be  processed by low-pass digital filter in order to improve signal-to-noise ratio and anti-interference ability. Considering resource of FPGA and real-time of tester, we design a 16 th order direct I type FIR low-pass digital filter as shown in Fig. 6 In the design of  FIR filter, Kaiser window is used with the paramters such as 0.5 of  beta, 6.4KHz of sampling frequency, 200Hz of cutoff frequency.

Analog ground and digital ground should be connected by single point near ADC and DAC 4 In order to improve interference immunity, PCB Printed Circuit Board\ should have large area bonding copper 5 Reduce the sampling rate of ADC appropriate to get higher conversion accuracy 6 The geophone must be placed vertically during the testing, otherwise the data acqui red would be ineffective [11 R EFERENCES 1 u X i aon i n g    T h e Cu rren t Situ at io n a nd Fut u r e D e ve lo pm en t o f  t h e Parameter-testiongh for Seismic DetectorŽ,Technology Supervision in Petrolevm Industry,vol.16,no.3,pp.30-31,2000 2 i an  Z e n g L i a n g  T he Us i ng an d t r ou bl e s ho ot in g o f S M T _ 3 00 Ge oph one TesterŽ,Equipment for Geophysical Prospecting, vol.17,no.3,pp.203-204 2007 3 u o F u lo ng  Y i b i j i n  L u o lan b i n g    T he  t e c hno lo gy an d app li c a t ion  o f  th e seismic geophoneŽ, Eouipment for Geo Physical Prospecting,vol.15, no.1 pp.6-14,2005 4 W a ng C h a n gm i n g,K o n g D e r e n et al T h e S e ns i n g a n d T e s t in g  Technology, Beijing:Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Press,2005 5 o Hon g w e i  Ch en Yi fang   e t  a l    S t udy  o n th e  M e a s u r i n g I n s t r u men t  fo r Characteristics of GeophoneŽ, Instrument Technique and Sensor, vol.4 pp.12-13,37,2002 6 Ma lc ol m B B er tr am  an d Er ic V  G a l l a n t G e o p h o n e e l em en t t e s t in g   Crewes Research Report, no.9,pp.1-4,1997 7 i Qunh e  Y u a n J i an guo   T he Pri n c i p l e an d  p e rfo rm a n c e  c o m p a r i s on o f  the Geophone Tester at Home and AbroadŽ,Oil Geophysical Prospecting vol.33,no.S2,pp.152-156, 1998 8 g T i e r ui e t a l  T h e De s i g n  o f Po r t a b l e Ge o pho ne Pa ra me te r T e st e r  Based on ARMŽ,Equipment for Geotechnical Engineering,vol.6, pp.2022,2006 9 F u X i a o n i n g,W a n g L i  R ese a r c h on t h e M eas ur em en t of O v er dam pe d  Coil GeophoneŽ, Modern Measurement and Test,no.3,pp.43-45,1999  A lter a Cor por ati o n,D S P  Bu il der  U s er G u i d e, A lter a C o r por a t i o n 2 0 0 5   11 Xi ang ya ng L i  a nd J i a nxi n Y u an  Geop hon e o r i e n t a t i on an d c oup li ng in threecomponent sea-floor dataŽ.Geophysical Prospecting, vol.47, pp.9951013, 1999 590 


 Fig. 6  North error with GPS/DR integrated filtering   From Tab.3, it is known that the positioning error of GPS/DR integrated filtering is reduced by approximate 150% to 180%, compared with GPS filtering alone, so the vehicle positioning accuracy is improved greatly. By further analysis, it is easy to find the following reasons: the main filter provides feedbacks to reset GPS and DR local filters, so the evaluation accuracy of GPS filter and DR filter is improved respectively, and in return, it makes the global state evaluation of the main filter optimal and the vehicle positioning accuracy improved From Fig. 3-4, it is easily known that the positioning error near 320s of GPS filtering alone changes greatly. It might have been caused by GPS signal interrupting, so the GPS/DR integrated filtering can avoid effectively the system unlock issue with a GPS alone system, which improves system credibility From the above analysis, we can conclude that the vehicle’s position evaluation based on GPS and DR information fusion has some advantages over the system with GPS or DR filtering alone  6. Conclusion  In summary, combining the GPS system with the low cost DR system, a vehicle integrated navigation system can avoid the system unlock caused by signal interrupt with GPS alone and big accumulated errors caused by gyro drift with DR alone. The federal Kalman filter is employed to fuse GPS and DR information, which makes the system’s global performance optimal. We design and implement the vehicle’s position evaluation based on GPS and DR information fusion, and it has the following advantages GPS system and DR system work independently When GPS or DR system breaks down, the brokendown system can be isolated from the main system The evaluation of main filter can be calculated by the other filter so that the main system continues to work normally  Because the main filter can provide feedbacks to reset the local filters, the evaluation accuracy of GPS filter and DR filter is improved respectively. In return it makes the global state evaluation of the main filter optimal GPS filter and DR filter calculating in parallel makes the system gain better real-time processing capability  References  1  Bishop R,  “A survey of intelligent vehicle application worldwide Proceedings of the IEEE intelligent vehicles symposium May 2000, pp.25-30 2  Zheng Chuanbiu, Tian Weifeng, Jin Zhihua, “Application of unscented Kalman filter in state estimation for land vehicle navigation system Journal of system simulation  vol. 17, no. 6, Jun 2005,pp. 1456-1458 3  Gharavi H, Ban K, “Multi hop sensor network design for wide band communications Proceedings of the IEEE August  2003, pp. 1221-1234 4  A.

 and start developing integrated systems again, or finding a method of migrating to a new generation of systems, which would support integration. Due to the rich source of information contained in them and to make development more manageable, the second option was chosen. Hence, in 2004 LGA_A started examining available solutions to meet the challenge for developing a standardised, flexible, integrated and homogeneous IT infrastructure. After reviewing these solutions, LGA_A took the decision to introduce ERP systems to solve their integration problems and provide better services. Also, LGA_A was aiming at integrating its business processes through an ERP solution. However, soon LGA_A realised that ERP systems cannot communicate with other packaged systems and have limitations, as they cannot exchange information with other vendor applications The insufficient nature of their IT infrastructure and the need for integration led LGA_A to revisit their strategies for developing integrated IT infrastructure. Thus, the top management formed an ambitious vision aiming at: \(a\abling integration internally and externally; \(b\ieving effective and efficient joined up government and \(c\abling electronic request and delivery of services. As a result, supporting the decision making process for EAI adoption. LGA_A did not take the decision to fully integrate the borough since such a solution had a high cost. SDE reported that the plan for developing an integrated IT infrastructure on a large scale was considered of high risk as there is no single integration technology or software package that supports the development of an integrated IT infrastructure and there is a lack of knowledge in LGA_A regarding on EAI solutions. This indicates that barriers like the lack of knowledge on EAI and the lack of a single EAI product that solves all integration problems, influenced their decisions As the plans for integrating LGA_A were not completely justified, its top management suggested a pilot to be run and evaluate its outcome. The pilot demonstrates that the integration is technically feasible, can deliver significant benefits to LGA_A and may assist in extracting relevant EAI barriers and risks. Such a decision is supported by the literature  G A _ A  h oped th at t h en central g o v e rnm ent would recognise the success and importance of the project and award it National Project status. As the decision was taken to adopt EAI solution for the pilot project and for other projects in future, the interviewees was asked to comment on whether what factors negatively and positively affected the EAI adoption process. HIT and SDM replied that   most vital negative factor was the silo mentality among our older staff members that resisted to such a change in the department this was also because there were insufficient technical skills and expertise to do integration and our staff lacked understanding of business integration for this reason we had to invest money to train our staff to build integration skills   The HIT also reported on positive factors   despite there were some problems but when systems integrated through EAI, the systems physically got better and everybody saw that the working conditions and our resources are improving i.e. performance as well as the systems improved. As a consequence of doing this the moral of the staff improved and communication and information sharing was enhanced   In the next section, the authors present the testing of research issues and highlighting the empirical results  4.1.

  4.2. Testing Research Issue 2 Adoption Lifecycle Phases  The interviewees were asked to comment and illustrate the importance of the aforesaid adoption lifecycle phases based on the EAI project. Initially all the interviewees agreed that these phases are very important. For example SDE reported that  yes these phases are very important with a perfect breakdown and we faced these phases in EAI project   Whereas, HIT reported that  proposal and adoption decision phases are vital and are the physical aspects whereas motivation and conception are not inevitably physical aspects unless you got a fairly refined strategic approach to what you want to do   SDM stated that before the motivation phase they also faced external driver phase in the project LGA_A was driven by some external influences e.g pressure from central government to improve their service delivery. Due to such influences, LGA_A was motivated to run a pilot project. In addition, the senior development support engineer and the HIT stated that they faced another phase before the proposal phase such as the discussion phase and the research phase respectively. After discussing on these phases with the interviewees, it appears that both have the same underlying meaning i.e  before adoption decision phase we may have research phase by research this we mean that we do some sort of discussions to run a pilot case study and this could be before the proposal phase. The reason to bring this phase before proposal is that if we need resources that actually enable us to do the pilot study, then we might need to take the decision to get the money to do it   After analysing all the interviews, the authors noted that external driver phase can be same as motivation phase. The reason is that an organisation may be motivated to take a step when it is either influenced internally due to some problem or externally through some stakeholders influence Whereas, the discussion or research phase may also be the same as proposal phase. The rationale is that in proposal phase e.g. the departments making decisions to adopt technology need to some sort of research and provide substantiated reasons for approval from the organisation based on the research, besides this the departments need to analyse their requirements and assess their capabilities for acquiring a technology Thus, the interviewees were asked to illustrate the importance of the adoption lifecycle phases. The importance of each phase is presented in Table 2  Table 2: Importance of Adoption Lifecycle Phases  Adoption Lifecycle Phases HIT SDE SDM Motivation  Conception  Proposal    Adoption Decision   4.3. Testing Research Issue 3 Mapping EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases  Before commencing on the mapping of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases, the interviewees were explained how to perform the mapping Thereafter, the interviewees were asked to map the factors influencing EAI adoption on different phases of the adoption lifecycle. The interviewees went through a rigorous thinking process and mapped the factors \(based on its influence\ each phase of the adoption lifecycle. Table 3 illustrates the results of the mapping of factors for motivation phase only The factors with less \(i.e. one interviewee supporting and other two not\ and no \(i.e. none of the interviewees supporting\ support are discarded. The reason is that these factors had less influence or did not influence on a specific phase. On the other hand factors with full \(i.e. all three interviewees supporting\ and moderate \(i.e. two interviewees supporting and third not supporting\ support are utilised for further empirical research  Table 3: Summarising the Factors with Full or Moderate Support on the Motivation Phase  Motivation Phase  Factors HIT SDE SDM PF Project Champion    Citizen s Satisfaction    Critical Mass    TF IT Sophistication    Data Security and Privacy    SP Top Management Support    Higher Administrative Authority    FF Return on Investment    OF Benefits    Size    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 4.4. Testing Research Issue 4 Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases  Table 1 validates the factors using Miles and Huberman w h erea s, T a ble 3 illustrates th e  mapping of factors on the motivation phase of the adoption lifecycle. However, these tables do not illustrate the important of each factor on the adoption lifecycle phases. This section introduces AHP technique to prioritise the importance of factor influencing EAI adoption. Table 4 illustrates the global weights-based prioritisation of factors for example on only motivation phase \(due to the constraints on length of the paper, the authors did not include the prioritisation results of other three adoption lifecycle phases\ These weights are obtained by using the Expert Choice \(EC\ software and the conclusions drawn from them are the final results of the analysis of collective judgements provided by the panel of interviewees selected for LGA_A. The results presented in these tables do not mean that any factor is unimportant. It merely exhibits interviewees perceptions on the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases  Table 4: Prioritising the Importance of Factors on the Motivation Phase  Prioritising Factors on the Motivation Phase Factor Categories Factors Prioritisation Result TF IT Sophistication 1\ 0.5963 SF Top Management Support 1\ 0.5963 PF Project Champion 2\ 0.5146 OF Benefits 3\ 0.4583 PF Citizen s Satisfaction 4\ 0.3568 OF Size 5\ 0.2083 PF Critical Mass 6\ 0.1293 TF Data Security and Privacy 7\ 0.0704 SF Higher Administrative Authority 7\ 0.0704 FF Return on Investment 8\ 0.0000  5. Discussions and Revision of the Model  According to the empirical findings, only two factors were not validated i.e. formalisation and evaluation framework. The reasons are: \(a\GA_A did not follow any formal procedure to assess EAI technological solution and \(b\ no evaluation framework was used to assess EAI technological solution but relied on the software vendor. Other factors have either directly or indirectly influenced the decision making process for EAI technological solution adoption. On the other hand, six new factors were identified such as \(a data consistence and project delivery timescale as internal pressure factors b stakeholder s pressure and competition as external pressure factors, \(c stakeholder s support as a support factors, and \(d central government grants  as a financial factor. Four new adoption lifecycle phases were also identified from the empirical findings from LGA_A: [\(a external driver and/or \(b driving force c discussion and/or \(d research phase  tern al driv e r or d r iv ing  f o rce ph a s e are prior to the motivation phase, discussion and or research phases are prior to the proposal phase whereas, adoption decision phase was also reported with a different term i.e investment phase. The findings illustrate that the role of factors, adoption lifecycle phases, mapping of factors and prioritising the importance EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases had high importance during EAI adoption process in LGA_A Thus, the authors propose that while exploring EAI adoption in LGAs a\actors, \(b\ lifecycle phases, \(c\mapping of factors and \(d\oritising the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases provides a deeper understanding of interrelationships within LGAs. In doing so, the revised proposed EAI adoption model may: \(a\ercome IT infrastructure limitations within LGAs, \(b\mprove the level of analysis and \(c\upport LGAs when adopting EAI  6. Conclusions  LGAs are complex organisations and are managed by the consent and rules set by the central government. They are influenced by other government authorities and ministries, and their IS adoption involve distributed decision-making based on a division of control and powers [17, 39   Conversely, private organisations have direct and undivided power over decisions and flexible management style with inter-departmental teams working in central coordination T h is  distinction illustrates that LGAs have a bureaucratic nature and are committed to outdated cultural values Such characteristics emphasize risk aversion and insist that structures enhance control rather than connected thinking with silos in LGAs, let alone between them reov er, each L G A dis p la y s  differences in the way: \(a\eir business processes are implemented to provide citizen services, and \(b makes its decisions that differs a lot from other private organisations h es e th eoris e d conceptions distinguish LGAs from other sectors EAI represents an attractive proposition to LGAs, since EAI offers the opportunity to leverage the systems into a seamless chain of processes and present a unified view of their information [12, 28  When such leveraging and presentation occurs, LGAs Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


  may capitalise on their opportunities offered by LGA initiatives \(e.g. e-Government\se then they may efficiently interact with their citizens and other stakeholders on a consistent basis w e v e r EAI is an emerging area within LGAs, thus, there remains an absence of theoretical models, which means there is still a case for the identification of factors that affect the decision making process for EAI adoption and identification of adoption lifecycle phases, with the development of empirically validated underpinnings argued, justified and presented in this paper. The authors sought to address the established voids by proposing a novel conceptual model for EAI adoption in LGAs. The model takes into consideration the parame ters that were identified in the normative literature as influencing factors and adoption lifecycle phases. The proposed conceptual model is novel as it includes: \(a\e model consists of a set of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A and incorporates factors identified separately in previous studies. These factors are used for the developing an EAI adoption model in LGAs, \(b\e model incorporates adoption lifecycle phases Empirical findings illustrate that LGA_A passed through these phases while adopting EAI, \(c\e model assimilates the mapping of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases, and \(d\e model incorporates the prioritisation \(importance\ EAI adoption factors in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases The model can be used as a tool for decisionmaking to support LGAs and allow decision makers and researchers to understand and analyse EAI adoption. The concepts of the proposed model can be used for the adoption of inter-organisational IS since such systems should focus on integrated technologies and infrastructures. An interpretive, qualitative case study approach was selected to conduct this research It is not the intention of this paper to offer prescriptive guidelines to EAI adoption but rather describe case study perspectives that allow other researchers to relate their experiences to those reported. Hence, offering a broader understanding of the phenomenon of EAI adoption in LGAs Therefore, the lessons learnt are a result of the description provided and do not seek to be prescriptive. These lessons are summarised below Lesson 1 The practical implications of the mapping of factors on adoption lifecycle phases are  this process can support in better understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs. This is vital as it can also support the managements  decision-making process while introducing EAI Lesson 2 Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases can further enhance the decision making process in LGAs. During the mapping of factors, the importance of factors was not recognised Prioritising the factors can assist LGA officials in realising and understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs Lesson 3 Findings on the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases reflect that each interviewee from LGA_A has relatively different conception while mapping the factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases. This may also illustrate that within different LGAs interviewees understanding, knowledge and ability to comprehend the importance of factors may differ Lesson 4 Findings related to the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors cannot be generalised as they may also differ from one LGA to the other Hitherto, the authors highlighted the individual elements of the contributions and research novelty presented in this paper. However, at the wider context this research aimed to enhance the technical decision making process while adopting EAI technologies in LGAs. This was achieved by proposing and validating a novel model \(Figure 1 for EAI adoption in the practical arena \(LGA_A The key beneficiaries are the decision makers and practitioners within LGAs, and researchers within the academic community. All of these benefit from the research in this paper as a guideline to analyse and understand EAI adoption in LGAs. In doing so this research work significantly contributes to the body of knowledge and practice in the areas of EAI and the local government domain by providing sufficient support to the decision makers in speeding up the EAI adoption process in LGAs   7.

Figure 9 also highlights the difficulty in designing a dynamic algorithm that is stable for most network configurations For data point 5 and 9 jitter is difficult to predict based on the AR PRESET This variability is most likely a result of the tolerance mechanism presenting artifacts during certain network configurations If the algorithm chooses too aggressively for too many data flows the contention parameters are set more aggressively and performance in the network suffers Although jitter remains better than NoDiff for all data points in Figure 9 providing more consistent behavior should be a primary goal for future versions of the AA SD Video Jitter 0.07 0.06 0.05  0.04  0.03 0.02 0.01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT and TS Nodes Figure 10 SD Video Jitter The average jitter for SD video is shown in Figure 10 This data represents a lower priority level and as compared to voice jitter in Figure 9 is able to provide better predictability The data still shows that performance for AA experiences greater variability than Normal but over most data points is better than both NoDiff and Normal HD video performance is similar to SD but has greater overall jitter and is therefore not shown Telemetry Jitter o 045 o 04 4 NoDiff Normal 0 035 AA 0 03 025 0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT Nodes 11 0.015 0.01 0.0050 Figure 11 Telemetry Jitter In Figure 11 which shows the jitter for Telemetry the data exhibits similar characteristics as the data for voice jitter Due to inconsistencies in the settling of the algorithm performance does not follow the same curve as NoDiff or Normal however for most data points the performance is better than NoDiff Figure 12 Command Round Trip Time The RTT for Command data is shown in Figure 12 Similar conclusions can be drawn from this data as have been discussed previously This data also exhibits greater variability than Normal and better overall performance than NoDiff The behavior of AA closely resembles that of AA in Figure 11 which reinforces the conclusion that the builtin hysteresis of the algorithm does not fully accommodate all network configurations Overall the Adaptive Algorithm is able to meet its goals of being a distributed way to dynamically manage priority and still perform similarly to static prioritization and better than no differentiation at all The self correcting characteristic of the algorithm leads to increased variability in performance which in some cases such as extreme network load causes the Adaptive Algorithm to perform significantly worse than static prioritization On the other hand network throughput is improved when the network is under-utilized because the Adaptive Algorithm is only engaged when performance requirements are not being met When viewed as a trade-off between simplicity of deployment and performance benefits over non-prioritized networks the Adaptive Algorithm can provide significant value to network architects and TS 


9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an extension to 802.1l e that dynamically adapts the contention parameters to meet performance requirements of lunar communications We have explored the capacity of 802.1lg using dynamic 802.1le to handle VoIP command telemetry and video according to their respective QoS requirements The data presented here shows that the Adaptive Algorithm can be deployed in these scenarios to effectively manage priority without a complicated centralized infrastructure This capability will be essential for short-range lunar communications in that quick deployment will be a primary goal The prevalence of 802.11 hardware and the possibility of the 2.4GHz band to perform at long and short ranges make it a viable option for future lunar networks However priority will be a necessity especially if the network carries non-critical traffic alongside mission-critical VoIP and data Future work on the algorithm will include improvement to the tolerance mechanism to reduce added contention from over-adjustment It is possible that more testing with more conservative settings will result in less variable network conditions at the expense of faster convergence Although we feel that the algorithm presented here is important we believe it is not the total solution It has been shown in previous works that in general 802.1 le increases contention in the network which results in overall lower throughput The Adaptive Algorithm does alleviate this disadvantage for some scenarios but not all Other works show that 802.1 le under the HCCA can solve the problem of throughput at the expense of simplicity and rapid deployment Therefore we expect that many 802.11 e deployments will use a mix of pure EDCA and HCCA in addition to using EDCA as a backup measure for HCCA Having an efficient and simple way to use ECDA will provide network architects with greater flexibility and will further reduce dependence on proprietary network design as we move towards expansion beyond the Earth 10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at Clemson University under the South Carolina Space Grant Consortium Research and Education Awards Program REAP and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 lb 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 IEEE 1999 2 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 le 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 Amendment 8 IEEE 1999 3 Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM Support for Multimedia Applications with Quality of Service in Wi-Fi Networks Wi-Fi Alliance September 1 2004 4 Swaminathan Arvind and James Martin 2006 Fairness Issues in Hybrid 802.1 lb/e Networks Consumer Communications and Networking Conference 2006 3rd IEEE Vol 1 Issue 8-10 50-54 5 Wietholter Sven and Hoene Christian 2003 Design and Verification of an IEEE 802.1 le EDCA Simulation Model in ns-2.26 TKN Technical Report Series Technical University Berlin November 2003 6 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 Dynamic Tuning of the IEEE 802.11 Protocol to Achieve a Theoretical Throughput Limit IEEE/ACM Transactions On Networking Vol 8 No 6 December 2000 785-799 7 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 IEEE 802.11 Protocol Design and Performance Evaluation of an Adaptive Backoff Mechanism IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications Vol 18 No 9 September 8 Chen D S Garg M Kappes K Trivedi 2002 Supporting VBR VoIP Traffic in IEEE 802.11 WLAN in PCF Mode Center for Advanced Computing and Communications ECE Department Duke University Durham NC Avaya Labs Research New Jersey 9 Siris Vasilios and Stamatakis George 2006 Optimal CWmin Selection for Achieving Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate 802.1 le WLANs Test-bed Implementation and Evaluation International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking WiNTECH 06 10 He Dajiang and Charles Shen 2003 Simulation Study of IEEE 802.1l e EDCA Vehicular Technology Conference Spring 2003 Vol 1 685-689 12 ILREFERENCES

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
