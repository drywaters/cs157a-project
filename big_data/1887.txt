systems do not include dedicated processes for covert channel detection. In this paper, we first propose mechanisms to detect common covert channels. Then, within a whole security system we propose an optimized order regarding the execution of the three major security processes: Firewall, Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\nd Covert Channel Detection System \(CCDS\. It will be demonstrated that the proposed order would allow security systems to offer better processing performances

that can be exploited by a process to transfer information in a manner that violates the system security policy [4  S o m e  features of the TCP/IP protocols suite can be used to send covert messages as discussed in [1,4,6,7   Covert channels are an immense cause of security concern because they can be used to pass malicious messages Therefore, detecting these covert channels is an important issue that needs to be addressed This paper discusses mechanisms for detecting the most common covert channels that use the TCP/IP headers. The mechanisms have been implemented in a security system called Covert Channel Detection System \(CCDS 
A whole security system should integrate at least three security processes, namely a Firewall, IDS, and CCDS Therefore, a whole security system, that includes Firewall IDS, and CCDS, should select the order of the execution of these processes for each given class of packet. Otherwise, a single order may affect the performance of the whole security system, since it may be suitable for a particular class of packets but not for another This paper presents an optimized order regarding the execution of the three security processes based on the classification of the packets. It will be demonstrated that the proposed order would allow security systems to offer better 
processing performances II MECHANISMS FOR DETECTING COVERT CHANNELS It is generally admitted that covert channels can not be completely eliminated [3, 4  Al t h o ugh i t co ul d be app re ci ab l y  reduced by design and careful analyzes In this paper, we propose mechanisms for detecting the hidden channels that might used the following fields Type of Service, IP Identification, IP options\( Strict source routing, Loose source routing, IP Timestamp and Record route are options chosen to embed hidden information. \, TCP initial sequence number \(ISN\, Urgent pointer.. The proposed 
mechanisms exploit mainly the characteristics of these channels and their weak points in order to be able to detect them 
This field is rarely used, thus the use of this field would be suspicious when it is set to a non null value. We should also mention that the bits 6 and 7 in this field are specified to be set to 0 [5   S o to d e t ect  a n o n leg itim ate u s e  o f th is f i e l d  w e  should check the value of these fields 
A IP covert channels detection 1 Covert channels using the \215Type of Service\216 field 2 Covert channel using the \215IP identification\216 field 
The values of this field are generated randomly, by the TCP/IP stack. But for packets belonging to the same 
connection and the same flow, the \215IP identification\216 field is incremented by 1. Thus, the detection of this particular hidden channel could be made by saving packets of various connections, calculating the difference between the IP IDs values of consecutive packets of each connection and test if it is equal to 1 
3 Covert channels using the following IP options: \215Strict source routing\216, \215Loose source routing\216, \215Strict source routing\216 and \215Record route\216 
First of all, these IP options require contents of IP addresses. So to detect covert channels using the IP options, we

need to check the validity of the inserted IP addresses in the IP options In addition, the use of the \215Record route\216 option as covert channel could also be detected using another technique. That is for consecutive packets, normally their network path will not change. So we should find the same list of IP addresses in the 215Record route\216 option for consecutive packets 1

We propose four classes This channel exploits the ISN field. In this case of hidden channels, the 3 rd packet of the TCP three-way-handshake packets is ignored. Thus, a method to detect this type of covert channel consists into detecting any non accomplished TCP connection class\(P\e Proposed treatment a Treatment #1 : Fragmented packets 2 For each class of packet, a particular treatment is applied In fact, a treatment indicates the order of execution of the Firewall, IDS, and CCDS. Table 1 shows the order of the execution of the three processes for each class of packets TABLE I T HE PROPOSED ORDER OF EXECUTION OF THE THREE PROCESSES FOR EACH CLASS OF PACKETS Urgent Pointer 1 2 3 4 Flood attacks packets class Class C2_UDP Figure 1 Treatment of fragmented packets Filter packets based on filtering rules defined in the Firewall A The classification process B Treatments of packets The \215 is the class of ICMP flooding attacks Flood packets are packets that intend to generate DoS attacks, such as SYN, ICMP and UDP flooding attacks Since there are three types of packets, we may define three sub classes, namely Class C2_TCP Class of packets integrating IP options Class C2_ICMP Class C1 Class C2 Class C3 Class C4 Fragmented packets class is the class of UDP flooding attacks The IP options appear seldom in the IP headers Consequently, packets with IP options are usually consider very suspicious Fragmented packets have the bit MF set to 1, or set to 0 and the "offset" field has a non null value class\(P\= {C2_ TCP class\(P\= {C2_ UDP class\(P\= {C2_ ICMP Treatment #2 A system, using the described detection mechanisms in the two previous sub-sections A and B, has been implemented. The system is called Covert Channel Detection System \(CCDS III INTEGRATION OF FIREWALL IDS AND CCDS SYSTEMS Let\220s assume we have an advanced integrated security system \(ISS\hat includes a Firewall \(FW\n Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\d a Covert Channels Detection System \(CCDS\. The ISS system should be able to perform three main functionalities, namely is the class of TCP flooding attacks 216 field is interpreted only if the URG bit is set. Thus, if this bit is not set, the "Urgent Pointer" field would have null content. On the other hand, if the URG bit is not set and this urgent pointer field contains a non null value we could mention the detection of a covert channel option, we should check if the timestamps values are increasing or not 200 200 200 200 200 200 Timestamp Detect and stop attacks based on attack signature defined in the IDS class\(P\= {C2_ TCP, C4 class\(P\= {C2_ UDP, C4 class\(P\= {C2_ ICMP, C4 class\(P\= {C3 class\(P\= {C3, C4 Treatment #3 The values of the timestamps should increase from a jump to another. To detect a hidden channel exploiting the  Detect coverts channels using detection mechanisms defined in the CCDS In this paper, we propose an optimization mechanism that uses a classification process. The classification process allows the ISS system to decide about how the packet will be treated In fact, once a packet reaches the ISS system, first it will be classified, then depending on its class, the order of the execution of the three processes will be selected for the packet A number of modern attacks use the application layer headers and data in the packets. Advanced security devices require deep inspection capabilities, known as Deep Inspection DI\, to detect application layer attacks Fragmented packets Treatment #1

When a received packet then the Firewall is activated to filter it. The IDS and the CCDS will be activated next. Depending on the nature of the incoming attack packets, which is usually random, we will switch between the FW is the number of rejected packets by the  IDS If The average packet processing time  by the  IDS of an initial packet The average fragment processing time by the CCDS IDS order. Let\220s define the following 200 IDS The average packet processing time by the ISS without the classification process reception from  the fragment arrives before the CCDS finishes processing fragment j \(Figure 3 Thus, we can deduce the following formula     2 So we have  3 reception    212   Figure 2 Figure 2 The CCDS treatment of two successive fragments when xij 3 j  To compute x\220 i we distinguish two cases in n j ij j j i i x x x x is the number of rejected packets by the CCDS The CCDS finishes processing fragment j before the arrival of fragment When the ISS system uses our classification mechanism the processing time for a given fragmented initial packet can be stated as follow j  j x ij j  j x ij 0 001 200 212  1 Arrival Fragment  n CCDS P i 1 Proccessing time evaluation with the classification process i i i i z y x t j i i n j in ij j j i i i i i i z y x x x t z y x t then the CCDS will be activated before the IDS and vice-versa. Thus with this treatment our system will be a stateful  learning integrated FW, IDS, CCDS j j 1 1  0  max  Packets that belong to the {C2, C4} class, present at the same time two risks: a risk to cause a flooding attack \(C2 a risk to carry hidden information \(C4\ Since the CCDS needs only one or two packets to detect a hidden channel, but the IDS needs usually more than one packet to detect attacks, mainly DoS attacks. That\220s why we have chosen the FW The average packet processing time  by the FW t i x i y i z i x ij Fragment 1 st case: x ij 2 nd case: x ij  Packet processing time by the ISS \(t i processing time of all the fragments of the initial packet by the CCDS+ processing time of the reassembled packet \(initial packet\ by the FW processing time of the reassembled packet by the IDS j+1 A Treatment #1 The average packet processing time by the ISS with the classification process The average processing time needed by the CDS for all the fragments IDS order to treat such type of packets. In the case of packets that belong to the {C3, C4} or {C3} classes they have specificity since they include applicative headers which must be treated in deep by the IDS. In such a case, the IDS needs several packets to decide whether the packets carry attacks or not. That\220s why the CCDS will be executed just after the Firewall, for this type of packets IV PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this section, we intend to evaluate the performance of an ISS system with and without our classification mechanism. The processing time of different types of malicious packets by the ISS system will be evaluated In order to evaluate the processing time, we define the following: For a packet n IDS The average packet processing time by the CCDS 001  fragments, we may define the following: For a fragment 1 1  0  max   CCDS waiting time for the 0 n CCDS n IDS n j i j  200 x ij  j+1 212  j+1  Fragment 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 j x ij j CCDS processing time for the fragment j Thus:      \(1 However, x\220 i f \(n, x ij     Each received fragmented packet will first pass through the CCDS to check if it carries hidden information. If it is the case the fragmented packet will be rejected and an automatic update will take place. That is, a rule, which will block all the fragmented packets that have the same IP ID as the rejected fragmented packet, will be added. If all the fragmented packets that belong to one original packet P do not encapsulate hidden data, the original packet P will be reassembled. Then, it will be sent to the Firewall. Thereafter, if it is not rejected by the Firewall, it will pass through the IDS \(Figure 1 b Treatment #2 : Flood attacks packets x\220 i j  212      a Treatment #3: Packets belonging to {C2, C4}, {C3 C4}, and {C3} classes t\220 i CCDS order and the FW fragment

Thus, we will have 7 001 transports hidden information, all the packet will be rejected.

So CCDS processing time for the fragment 001  With the classification process With the classification process 1 st case 2 nd case 001  However, the time that the CCDS needs to treat a fragment x ij ost equal to the time needed to treat the original packet \(x i This is due to the fact that the mechanisms implemented on the CCDS treat only the IP header and TCP header. Thus, treating a fragment or the original packet will take almost the same time In this case, we will have the following formula, when the ISS includes the classification process 11 However, when the ISS does not include the classification process, we will have With the classification process, if the fragments encapsulate a hidden channel, the CCDS will detect it, since in general With the classification process we have 13 CCDS processing time for the fragment j 212  Fragment Fragment j+1 Arrival 3 Case studies a   212  212  l l i i x x j Arrival i i i n j j i z y x t i i n j in ij j j i i z y x x x t i i n j in j i i i n j in ij j j i i i n j in ij j j i i z y x t z y x x x z y x x x t i i n j in ij j j i i z y x x x t x i  212     Thus, the classification process allows the ISS to offer almost the same performances as when no classification process is used 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1       If we consider the reassembling We consider the case of an inoffensive fragmented packet The processing time for this type of packet is    9 The processing time for this type of packet is    10 We agree that without the classification process, the ISS will have to wait until the initial packet is reassembled, before carrying out its treatment. Therefore, the average packet processing time \(t\220 i by the ISS can be as follows If the fragment 1 So       8 Thus, we will have 1 1  200 200 200 200 200 200 j x ij  002 fragment   1 1  0  max 1 1 1 1 1 1

On one hand, it is specific to packets encapsulating IP options, which are likely carrying hidden channels. On the other hand, this treatment is specific to packets integrating an applicative layer which is deeply inspected by the IDS Since max d d d d d d d z y t z x y t        V CONCLUSION In this paper, first we proposed mechanisms for detecting covert channels that use TCP/IP headers to hide information The mechanisms have been implemented in a security system called Covert Channel Detection System \(CCDS The processing of the packets by the three processes Firewall, IDS, and CCDS\ should be optimized. That\220s why we have proposed treatment mechanisms based on the classification of the received packets. The performance evaluation gave satisfactory results This work could be extended by proposing other mechanisms for detecting more types of covert channels [5   We could also extend this work by implementing a prototype system R EFERENCES 1 A hsan K a m r an 215 Co v e r t C h a nne l A n al y s is and D a t a H i d i ng  i n T CP  I P 216 Master Thesis, University of Toronto, 2002 2 B a ss T   215I n t ru si o n De t e ct i o n Sy st ems a n d  M u l t i se n so r Da t a F u si o n 216   Communications of the ACM, Vol. 43, No. 4, pp 99-105, April, 2000 3 B  W  L a m p s on 215A n o t e on th e c o n f i n em en t p r o b lem  216 in P r oc eed i n gs of the Communications of the ACM, number 16:10, pp. 613\205615 October 1973 4 C  H   R o w l a n d  215C over t ch an n e ls in th e TC P  I P p r ot oc ol s u i t e 216 Tec h  Rep. 5, First Monday, Peer Reviewed Journal on the Internet, July 1997 5 Chr i sto p h e r A b ad I P che cksum c o v e r t chan ne l s and se l e cte d h a s h  collision", Technical report, 2001 6 K am r an A h s a n a n d D e e p a K u nd ur   P r acti cal  da ta h i di ng i n T C P  I P    I n  Proceedings of the Workshop on Multimedia Security at ACM Multimedia, December 2002 7 M  W o lf 215C ov ert c h ann els i n L A N p r ot oc ols  216 in Proc eed in gs of t h e  Workshop on Local Area Network Security \(LANSEC\22089\, pp. 91 \205 102, 1989  R i c ha r d St even s 205 \215T C P  I P I l lu s t ra t e d  Volu m e 1 216 200 1   9 S te v e n J   M ur do c h S t e p he n L e w i s    E m be d di ng  Co v e r t Ch a nne l s i nto  TCP/IP", the 7th Information Hiding Workshop, Barcelona, Catalonia Spain\ 6 \205 8 June 2005 i i i x y t d z i x i t i t i i i in n j ij i z y x x t                CCDS ICMP packets carrying hidden information in the IP \215Timestamp\216 option  1  1 1 1 IDS For the IDS i i i i x z y t d i For IDS order.

It is capable of solving the challenging instance 21, 8\been solved by any other algorithm yet \(to the best of our knowledge\hows the results of PMS3. The table does not include the result for L less than 17. Although, PMS3 is an efficient algorithm, we had to implement it in such a way so that it is able to work for higher values of L and D. Thus, the algorithm does not perform better than the previous algorithms for the lower values of L L d Time 17 6 20,000 sec 18 6 12,000 sec 19 7 26 hrs 21 8 22 days Table1. Performance results for PMS3 Although, PMSP 3 which are also improvements over PMS1 perform better than PMS3 for \(17, 6\, they are still not able to solve the challenging instance \(21, 8\ MCL-WMR [4 shows g ood  results but it can\222t solve the challenging instance \(17, 6  For challenging instances, the list R generated in PMS3 is of the size nearly equal to 4 l\222 Thus, for such cases we actually check for all possible l\222 mers. This problem is solved in PMS3p by using the pruning technique. For the l 2 mers in Sequence 1, we generate all neighbors with a hamming distance less than or equal to d For challenging instances, this would be of the size 4 l2 The space complexity of this algorithm would be O \(mn\etically the time complexity of PMS3p would be same as PMS3. But, in practice there would be a significant improvement. We can claim this because PMSprune which is an improvement over PMSP, take only 69 minutes to solve 17, 6\ours taken by PMSP PMS3 takes about 5.5 hours to solve the same problem. So, if we implement PMS3p we expect the time taken to be less than an hour. It is noteworthy that MCL-WMR does not work for the challenging instances like 17, 6\It can solve the \(non-challenging instance \(18,6\gorithm proposed in this paper is much faster compared to it VI  CONCLUSION We have extended and implemented PMS3 which was initially proposed in  The algorithm uses a very simple concept Although it takes a little more time than PMSP and PMSprune [3 a p a b le of solving \(21, 8\e of the previous algorithms have been able to solve challenging instances for d 7. For instance our algorithm is better than the algorithm proposed in [4  The algorithm has scope for  improvements and in future we would be working on methods to reduce the time.  The new algorithm PMS3p proposed here has not been implemented yet, but we expect that it would be much faster than PMS3 and will also outperform PMSprune  VII  REFERENCES    S. Rajasekaran, S.

success was obtained by acquiring high resolution data from the TriDAR success rate obtained using TriDAR data Very good performance is observed success rate of the algorithm increases with the number of polygons tested As would be expected the processing time also scales with the number of polygons but is only slightly affected by the target range Note that the number of points was used for simulations Figure 13 presents the even when the target is only partially visible As observed in simulations the Success Rate with TriDAR Data mean pose mean pose same as what vs Range 3-sigma processing time ms vs Range m 1000 F Figure 12 Sample point clouds obtained using the selected  500 _ n a 400 300 200 100 0 _ 4 Figure 1 Range 6 8 10 12 Range m 1 Polygon 2 Polygons 5 Polygons 14 16 18 4 Processing Time 3a of the algorithm our purposes considering the relatively low accuracy required from the localization system The criteria for pose vs Range m 20 10 0 _ Figure 11 Target Object 4 6 8 10 12 Range m 1 Polygon 2 Polygons 5 Polygons 14 16 18 Figure 13 Success Rate with TriDAR data scan patterns side view Lissajous left Rosette middle Spiral right The true relative pose used for determining pose error and localization sensor at each position and calculating the pose using an ICP algorithm This technique provides an estimate of the ground truth that is close enough for success remained the on target remained fairly constant 900-1000 throughout all these tests Table 3 shows the absolute error observed during lab testing for successful localizations The pose accuracy does not significantly improve when using more polygons but it remains well within the desired range The error observed is also consistent with simulation results Table 2 900 800 700 E a 600 E vs Table 3 Lab Testing Mean Pose Error 9 100 90 80 70 0 60 t 50 n a 30 Polygon X Y Z RotX RotY RotZ s mm mm mm deg deg deg 1 50.3 41.8 30.5 1.6 1.4 2.8 2 41.3 45.7 28.9 1.52 1.4 2.8 5 40.8 47.2 30.3 1.4 1.3 3.1 


6 CONCLUSION Neptec has developed a vision system for autonomous onorbit rendezvous and docking that does not require the use of cooperative markers on the target spacecraft The system uses an active TriDAR 3D sensor and efficient model based tracking algorithms to provide 6 degree of freedom 6DOF relative pose information in real-time The system takes full advantage of the large amount of geometric information contained in 3D data sets By following the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm where the sensor only acquires the data necessary to obtain the pose of the target real-time performance can be achieve with flight hardware Following the same smart scanning strategy Neptec has developed a novel technique for localizing a known object on-orbit The new technique called Polygonal Aspect Hashing does not require an initial guess of the relative pose and therefore can be used to initialize tracking or recover if tracking is lost Furthermore it only requires a very sparse non organized 3D point cloud thus keeping the data acquisition and pre-processing overhead to a minimum The technique follows logic similar to the process of adding a piece in a jigsaw puzzle First the set of possible positions and orientations of the scan with respect to the model is reduced to the set of poses that have sufficient overlap Once the set of poses is reduced to the most likely candidates a surface fit check is performed to determine the best matching pose The surface fit check measures the amount of overlap between an input scan and the surface of a reference 3D model of the object to find The algorithm developed was tested with both simulated and TriDAR data Results showed excellent performance and demonstrated that the algorithm works well even with very sparse input data sets as well as in the presence of sensor noise and distortions Processing time results obtained showed that real-time performance can be achieved with this technique As would be expected it was shown that the robustness can be increased by testing more polygons at the expense of processing time Another alternative would be to run the algorithm with one polygon over several sequential scans This technique would be well suited for operations where there is relative motion between the sensor and target like in a tumbling satellite scenario or if the processing power is limited In the future Neptec plans to test more objects with representative geometry and materials to further characterize the algorithm performance The effect of object symmetries will also be investigated It was observed that most failures tend to occur where the object is most symmetric Code optimization will also be performed to further improve performance 1 MacLean S Pinkney L Machine Vision in Space Can Aeronaut Space J 39\(2 63-77 1993 2 Howard Richard T Bryan Thomas C DART AVGS flight results Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp.65550L 2007 3 Ruel S English C Anctil M Church P 43DLASSO Real-time pose estimation from 3D data for autonomous satellite servicing Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 4 Ruel S English C Anctil M Daly J Smith C Zhu S Real-time 3D vision solution for on-orbit autonomous rendezvous and docking Proc SPIE Vol 6220 pp.622009 2006 5 Andrew Johnson and Martial Hebert Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3-D scenes IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21\(5 449 May 1999 6 H Wolfson I Rigoutsos Geometric Hashing An Overview IEEE Computational Science  Engineering 4\(4 October 1997 7 English C Zhu X Smith C Ruel S Christie I TriDAR A hybrid sensor for exploiting the complimentary nature of triangulation and LIDAR technologies Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 8 J Obermark G Creamer B Kelm W Wagner C Henshaw SUMO/FREND vision system for autonomous satellite grapple Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp 65550Y 2007 9 Deslauriers A Showalter I Montpool A Taylor R Christie I Shuttle TPS inspection using triangulation scanning technology SPIE 2005 Orlando Florida April 2005 10 Ruel S English C Melo L Berube A Aikman D Deslauriers A Church P and Maheux J Field testing of a 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Orlando Florida April 12-16 2004 11 English C Ruel S Melo L Church P and Maheux J Development of a Practical 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Proceedings on Automatic Target Recognition XIV Orlando Florida April 2004 10 REFERENCES

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
