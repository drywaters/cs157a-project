I INTRODUCTION With the increasing popularity of multimedia applications over wireless links Quality of Service QoS support has become a critical demand for next generation Wireless Local Area Networks WLANs 
The recent IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access EDCA 1 provides service differentiation with a priority-based medium access control MAC mechanism A link layer Automatic Repeat reQuest ARQ scheme is used to retransmit the corrupted packets due to channel errors or collisions Retries will continue until either the corresponding acknowledgement is received or the retry count reaches a predefined limit However this scheme may not be effective under a fading channel with correlated errors where there is a high probability that bad channel condition continues for a certain period when a transmission error occurs In that case the channel may stay in a deep fade on the 
order of multiple frame transmission durations The frame drop rate and delay will considerably increase due to consecutive retransmission failures and the bandwidth is wasted from a system point of view as useless messages occupy the channel Cooperative communication is becoming a promising technology for wireless networks 2 by exploiting multipath fading instead of mitigating its impact Single antenna devices can share their antennas in a cooperative manner to emulate a Multi-Input Multi-Output MIMO system and exploit the 978-1-4244-2644-7/08/$25.00 2512008 IEEE spatial diversity benefits traditionally realized by an antenna array hosted on a single device Inspired by this 
A 
idea cooperative retransmission has been shown to be an effective technology to improve the reliability of wireless links 3][4][5 A retransmission could be initiated from a relay node that overheard the information packet instead of the original source Since signals from different locations undergo independent fading gains the retransmission success probability can be greatly increased by exploiting this spatial diversity In 3 a simple but effective ARQ scheme called Node-Cooperative Stop and Wait NCSW is proposed to reduce the average duration of retransmission trials Significant gain has been shown for a single sender-receiver pair by an analytical model cross-layer 
relaying protocol based on hybrid-ARQ with incremental redundancy termed Hybrid-ARQ-Based INtra\255 cluster GEographic Relaying HARBINGER is proposed in 4 The nodes decoding the data use Global Positioning System GPS to identify their positions relative to the destination and the one closest to the destination will relay the frame In 5 a Cooperative communication MAC CMAC is proposed to improve link reliability for WLANs Two transmission queues are maintained in each node One is the data queue for its own outgoing data and another is the partner queue to buffer the copies of the overheard frames A higher 
priority is given to the partner queue such that the cooperative retransmission can occur before the original source retransmits To the best of our knowledge there is no scheme considering the QoS support with differentiated services Furthermore a practical and effective protocol and a system-level investigation are lack in the literature From a system perspective retransmissions from relays may equivalently increase the number of competing nodes in a system and thus may degrade the system performance if inappropriately employed In addition a distributed coordination mechanism is needed to solve the relay collision problem since there may be several nodes that 
can serve as relays In this paper we propose a novel Differentiated Cooperative MAC called DC-MAC for QoS enhancement in WLANs based on the IEEE 802.11 e architecture Retransmission priority is introduced at relays for different traffic classes A channel-aware feedback mechanism is proposed to make cooperative retransmission employed only when necessary and only by competent nodes The rest of this paper is organized as follows The details of our proposed protocol are presented in Section II In Section III simulation model and performance evaluation are discussed Conclusions are given in Section IV 


In IEEE 802.11 e EDCA 1 traffic with different priorities is mapped into several Access Categories ACs at each station Each AC has an associated transmission queue and contends for the transmission opportunity using a set of EDCA parameters the Arbitration InterFrame Space AIFS[AC minimum Contention Window size CWmin[AC maximum Contention Window size CW max  AC and maximum retry limit M retry  AC By appropriately setting access parameters for each AC service differentiation can be achieved Based on this architecture our new transmission queue model is shown in Fig 1 There are two queues at each station for its own best-effort Own Classl and real-time traffic Own Class 2 respectively In addition there is a Partner Queue PQ for each traffic category To support cooperative retransmission each partner queue should be assigned to a higher priority than its corresponding own queue for retransmissions in order to avoid wasting the bandwidth by useless retransmission from the original source and reduce the retransmission delay To support the QoS of real-time traffic the priority of the partner queue for best-effort traffic should be set between the ones of two own queues By this way the benefit of cooperative retransmission can be exploited and meanwhile service differentiation is supported Each queue has a set of its own medium access parameters and all the original regulations in the 802.11 e EDCA are inherited e.g internal collision resolution Therefore our scheme can be easily integrated into the current deployed 802.11e WLANs Higher Priority Transmission queues Per-queue EDCA functions with internal collision resolution MAC Header a Data frame b ACKINAK frame Figure 2 Proposed MAC frame formats in DC-MAC AC2 AC3 Partner Class 2 OlNtl Class 1 A CO Partner Class 1 Class 2 ACt OlNtl Since retransmissions from the partners may cause increased network load and thus intensify the station competition they should be employed only when necessary The missing of an Acknowledgement ACK frame may be caused by either a collision with other frames or a transmission Lower Priority A Transmission Queue Model B Loss Distinguishing and Channel Estimation Figure 1 Transmission queue model in OC-MAC error over wireless link A loss-distinguishing mechanism is essential for the system performance The partners should not retransmit the lost frame due to collision since this will further intensify the competition The original source has the capability of taking care of the retransmission by itself In addition up-to\255 date Channel State Information CSI between the destination and itself is needed by a partner to determine if it has the capability to help retransmission Without this information a useless retransmission from a partner may intensify the relay competition and waste the bandwidth A novel Negative AcKnowledgement NAK control frame is proposed here to solve the above two problems all at once In 802.11e each data frame consists of three basic components a MAC header a frame body and a Frame Check Sequence FCS The MAC header comprises frame control duration address sequence control and QoS control information The FCS is calculated over all the fields of the MAC header and the frame body to determine if a received frame has been successfully decoded Since the MAC header alone is much shorter than the whole frame it has a higher probability to be decoded In addition the MAC header can be transmitted at a lower rate compared to the frame body to further improve its reliability In a WLAN scenario without hidden nodes where a collision occurs only when more than one node sends data in the same slot both the header and the frame body will be corrupted due to a frame collision This observation has been used to design a loss-distinguishable MAC in 6 As in 6 a Header Check Sequence HCS is added immediately after a MAC header to verify the correctness of the MAC header as shown in Fig 2a A NAK frame is proposed to indicate the occurrence of an unsuccessful transmission due to fading II PROPOSED PROCOTOL Our proposed protocol is based on the IEEE 802.11e EDCA architecture and thus can be easily integrated into current systems Without changing the original stop-and-wait ARQ scheme in a source the neighbouring nodes overhearing the frames will help in retransmissions and thus our scheme falls into the category of decode-andforward transmission 2 Without loss of generality we consider two traffic classes in this paper one is best-effort data traffic and the other is real\255 time multimedia traffic  


denotes the SNR threshold to support a data rate Note that NAK will not waste additional bandwidth as channel has been reserved by the data frame for possible ACK transmission according to the 802.11 e standard C An example of frame transmission sequence is shown in Fig 4 When a source transmits a data frame to a destination some neighbour nodes may overhear this frame thanks to the broadcast nature of wireless medium Based on the regulation in Section n.B the destination will respond with an ACK or NAK frame or keep silent which respectively indicates the occurrence of a successful frame transmission an unsuccessful transmission due to fading channel or an unsuccessful transmission due to frame collision The neighbour nodes will help in retransmissions only if a NAK frame with good enough SNR is received The overheard data frame including its original head information will be buffered in the corresponding partner queue based on its priority If the backoff counter of one partner queue reaches 0 the frame at the head of this queue will be transmitted with the original source address in the MAC header The destination will treat the frame from a relay as the one from the original source and respond with an ACK or a NAK frame destined to the original source or keep silent The queue statuses at each node are updated in a real-time manner on hearing the ACK or NAK frames Any node receiving the ACK will check its corresponding queue own queue for the source and partner queue for the neighbour nodes and flush out the corresponding data Any node except the source receiving the NAK will capture its SNR and flush out the corresponding data in the corresponding partner queue if the SNR is no longer good enough If neither an ACK nor a NAK is received by current node in relaying it will double its contention window and enter another backoff as a frame collision occurs The number of retry attempts for a frame in a partner queue should be small to avoid burdening the network load Figure 4 An example of frame transmission sequence in DC-MAC denotes the sensed Signal\255 to-Noise Ratio SNR of the NAK frame and D 0 267\267 O       seq a Due to the distributed nature of the protocol an efficient and reliable mechanism is needed to keep the information in each node up to date avoid redundant retransmissions and enable duplicate detection For instance some relay nodes may still try to transmit the out-of-date frames that have been received by the destination due to the loss of the ACK frame The source may inappropriately drop the data frame on receiving the out-of-date ACK frame In the IEEE 802.11 e standard each data frame is assigned a sequence number from a receiver and priority specific counter This number remains constant in all the retransmissions and increments by 1 for the next frame belonging to the same priority/receiver pair The receiver will determine the received frame to be a duplicate if its sequence information matches the most recent cached entry In DC-MAC a sender may receive an ACK at its own backoff stage and thus it has to be aware of the validity and the object to be acknowledged of this ACK frame Two new fields are included in an ACK frame as shown in Fig 2b acknowledged QoS control and sequence control field which are used to identify the traffic priority and the sequence control information of the data frame to be acknowledged respectively The total overhead due to the extra frame fields including HCS field in data frame is much smaller compared to the total overhead of one data transmission When a node receives an ACK frame destined to it it will check the cached sequence number of the data frame in the corresponding transmission queue If the sequence number in ACK matches the cached one the corresponding data frame is acknowledged Otherwise the ACK is determined to be out of date and dropped To avoid redundant retransmission each partner will replace the old frame with the new one if a data frame with the latest sequence number is overheard from the same sender In practical implementation a sequence number is produced from a single module-4096 counter A small window

channel The Partner Class 1 AC 1 2 CW  1 mis 38 frames are dropped in 802.11e due to exceeded retransmission threshold A transmitter can only see a single realization of the channel within its retransmission duration and thus ARQ scheme based on time diversity cannot help DC\255 MAC solves this problem by exploiting spatial diversity Facilitated by real-time channel estimation in DC-MAC a very high retransmission successful probability can be achieved by retransmitting the frames from a competent relay To clarify the effects of retransmission priorities at relays we investigate a mixed traffic scenario where four stations with uplink background UDP traffic and one station with uplink video traffic are symmetrically placed on the circle Idle stations move continuously and randomly within the circle at a constant speed of 1 mls To clearly show the performance differences each flow is saturated Le it always has a frame awaiting transmission We can see in Fig 6 that the sizes of CW min at relays for different traffic classes can significantly affect the relative performance ratio of these traffic classes When CW 2 is fixed the performance of video flow is improved as CW 1

III SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS We implement the proposed protocol in OPNET 11.5 7 and compare it with the original 802.11e EDCA The effects of the key parameters of DC-MAC are identified We simulate an 802.11 b WLAN consisting of an Access Point AP several stations with uplink traffic and 20 idle stations which may potentially act as relays All the idle stations are randomly distributed within a circle of radius 120m while the AP is located at the centre of this circle We have assumed two types of traffic flows video streams and background UDP traffic which are transmitted from own queue 2 AC2 and own queue 1 ACO respectively The set of prioritized access parameters used in simulations are shown in Table I For purpose of comparison the default parameters defined in OPNET are used for both own queues The basic 802.11 parameters used are shown in Table II The channel simulation model proposed in 8 is incorporated into OPNET to simulate a the average period of time for which

metrics are evaluated 225 Throughput Total data traffic in bits/sec successfully received and forwarded to the higher layer by each AC 225 MAC Delay From the time a frame arrives at the head of the transmission queue to the time it is successfully transmitted or dropped by the MAC We first evaluate the impact of the channel coherence time that is inversely proportional to the maximum Doppler shift and determined by the maximum velocity of objects in environment To clarify the effects of different aspects separately we only consider one station with uplink video traffic travelling along a straight line to and from the AP at a constant speed of mls in an oscillatory motion The distance between them varies between 80m and 120m The traffic is generated at a rate of 400 Kbps with a frame

 back then visit those pages in the log with IECaptureViewer, our tool to view and scrub through the data logs and screenshots.  \(See Figure 5 for the log viewing tool used.\happened, all participants but one had searches on days 2, 4 and 6.  In the one missing case, the next prior search event was used \(substituting day 3 for day 4 For each of the days in question, the experimenter would jump to the first search query made on that day and show it to the participant.  \(Note that jumping to the screen image in question was important, as to avoid showing the participant later screen images that would have shown them the sequence of events The experimenter then asked the participant to describe what happened next in the search process  The participant was instructed to describe the next event if they felt reasonably confident that they knew what happened While the participant was not prompted for a particular kind of answer, we noted possible variations on their answer. Was the search successful with this query alone?  Did the participant have to continue searching after this point in time? If they continued, did they have to continue refining the current query or do something else entirely?  This free form question made it easy to assess whether or not the participant could recall the situation at all If the participant could not recall, then the experimenter would go forward in time, replaying one event image after another until the participant could recollect what was going on and was able to predict what the next search event would be We were measuring the participant s ability to speak accurately about the next major event in their search process.  That is, having cued their retrospective memory of an event, we measured their ability to recall the next step in the process.  In nearly all cases, the judgment by the research was clear and evident: either the participant could accurately predict what was coming up in the log, or they just couldn t say.  Rarely did a participant guess and feel confident Results For each participant we had two measures the number of correct predictions based on a cued recall, and the number of times they had to go to the next-page before they could recollect what was going on in the search As can be seen in Figure 3, seven of the eight participants could accurately predict the next search event after two days.  That s not terribly surprising given that searches are relatively infrequent \(in this participant pool, the average number of searches / week was 11\ search done two days ago is relatively recent and stands out by its relative rarity among the total number of web events However, as we tested farther into the past \(4 days and 6 days out\t recall was still quite good Even after nearly a week, participants were able to recall the next search event correctly 75% of the time With the additional prompting of advancing to the next page in their cached screenshots using the IE Capture Viewer, participants can recall accurately after seeing only 3 additional screen images taken from the log/screen files   Figure 3. The number of correct next event predictions drops after 2 days, but is still at 75 correct It was clear during the interviews that participants really could recollect not just the next event, but also how this search fit into the larger story of what was going on at the time.  Even after 6 days, participants were able to not just make a prediction about the next event, but also complete the story and say whether or not the entire task \(of which search was just a part\was successful or not 6.  DISCUSSION In Study #1 we discovered that the use of IE Capture enabled our participants to richly and confidently talk about events that happened in the course of their web use.  Even the absence of certain kinds of events, such as the diminution in the use of a particular feature, was available for discussion and introspection Intriguingly, during the interviews, participants seemed able to speak with assurance about what had happened even quite a while ago.  But questions about the accuracy of the recalled memories kept worrying us That concern led to Study #2 and an attempt to measure the accuracy of the recollections  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


 Figure 4. As the time since last search increases, the average number of next-pages needed to correctly recall the next search event increases Note that even after 6 days, only 3 next-pages are needed to get to completely accurate recall  As became quickly clear, participants were not only able to make accurate predictions about particular events for which they had not been pre-conditioned to attend, but that it was the presence of the cueing screen images that was causing the effect.  More than one participant commented on the inclusiveness of the screen images: because they could often see other windows in the background \(the corner of the Excel spreadsheet, say\ those tiny peripheral context cues would give them a distinct sense of time, activity and place.  [1  A particularly difficult part of the protocol described here is that the recollection process begins on the first query in a search session.  While beginning on the initial query makes the questions unambiguous, it also requires that the participant remember the context that leads up to the query as cued by that single instance.  In our next trials, we plan on backing up two or three pages in order to give our participants a bit more of the temporal context as a way of improving recall even more One possible confound that we noted \(but were luckily able to avoid in this study\ was the potential for confusion over repeated searches.  As others have noted  repeate d s earch es are f a irl y co m m o n W h en  w e  were selecting queries from the participant s log, we took care to avoid queries that had been repeated, as it would be difficult for the participant to reconstruct what happened on that particular instance of the search \(as opposed to other instances within the past few days In the course of our studies, we have actually run many more participants than we tested for this paper.  To date, we now have experience with more than 30 participants, and have been struck both by how well people remember their previous search history when retrospectively cued.  Without cueing or just by cueing with web log history entries, recollection is very low after one day We have also been impressed by the discovery in Study #2 that participants seem to forget about the presence of the IE Capture logger after about four days As we noted in Study #1, people do seem to slightly modify their behavior within the first 3 to 4 days after installation.  There is also compensatory behavior after being reminded of its presence, as when the participant manually causes an upload event to occur Few people disabled IE Capture after it was initially turned on.  This suggests both that participants did not find it to be invasive and that its performance did not affect machine behavior substantially.  In fact, in one memorable instance, we discovered IE Capture was still running in the background of one participant s computer 90 days after the experiment.  Before turning it off, we took advantage of the situation to do a study of 30, 60 and 90 day post recollections and then going through the same protocol as before.  We repeated the experimental design from above, locating searches done 30, 60 and 90 days in the past.  Surprisingly, we found that our participant could recall many of the search events from as long as 90 days ago, albeit with many more next-page looks at the surrounding context.  In each case, after looking at a few surrounding pages, the participant would exclaim oh yes that search and then proceed to describe the rest of the session fairly accurately This unexpected anecdote gives us confidence that memories for the relatively recent past, say within the past week or two as measured in our studies can be relied upon as a source of correct behavioral information 7.  CONCLUSION Using a lightweight, passive longitudinal study method for capturing screenshots with log data, then conducting later interviews using the screenshots as retrospective cues, we were able to collect accurate contextual information from participants with little effort on their part. Participant dropout rates also seem to be lower than traditional longitudinal studies. From a researcher perspective, the data analysis can be completed more quickly and the recollections of the participants are fairly certain to be accurate While the results of this logging method are promising, privacy concerns for participants make it a bit more difficult to recruit for studies. While we have had reasonably good experience in recruiting participants, we have had to be very clear in explaining what is happening and the data retention policies.  These privacy concerns must be kept in consideration when recruiting participants to ensure proper lead team for recruitment and that any potential participants are properly briefed on the data being collected Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 Once explained clearly, the use of the screenshot logger and the retrospective cued recall method seems promising as a way of quietly collecting longitudinal behavioral data accurately 8.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
