Agile Deployment:  Lean Service Management and Deployment Strategies for the SaaS Enterprise   Robert Benefield British Telecom plc robert.benefield@bt.com    Abstract  The Software as a Service \(SaaS\ delivery model has recently become an acceptable business model for software delivery.  However, the attractiveness of SaaS to customers, with their low upfront costs and seamless delivery, changes the game in ways that challenge traditional software development methodologies.   As customers begin to treat software as an on demand 
utility, expectations of high up time, predictable quality strong security and privacy, and lower total costs become at least as critical as time-honored feature functionality requirements. The efficiency and accuracy of delivery can make or break a business.  As demands upon the service increase and change, the resilience and transparent scalability of the operational architecture becomes as important as that of the software running within it.  This paper explores how these new challenges parallel modern demands within manufacturing, and how many key Lean manufacturing techniques might be applicable within 
this emerging field     1. Introduction  The advent of the Internet created an entirely new mechanism for information, software and business delivery that has revolutionized society.  The ubiquity of the web browser and Internet connectivity has become a huge draw to businesses of all sizes as it allows for immediate and unencumbered access to the consumer. Entire multi billion dollar industries, from 
search and media conglomerates like Yahoo! and Google to commerce platforms like Amazon and EBay to business tools and process companies like Salesforce.com and Netsuite depend entirely upon the Internet to exist.  More and more companies, from the IBMs of the world down to sole proprietorships, rely upon systems that are part of, connected to, or built on top of other services entirely contained in this emerging Internet platform to conduct their day to 
day business For the software industry the Internet platform  introduces a means to replace the traditional bottlenecks of delivering shrinkwrapped media, a model that requires manual installation on customer supplied hardware, with immediately accessible web pages and APIs connected to the Internet from supplier hosted applications.  This distribution mechanism allows for incredible speeds to market and rapid adoption.  It also lowers costs through eliminating the 
need for additional equipment on the consumer side Other cost lowering tactics such as customer multitenancy are also possible.  As the application upgrades are in the control of the supplier, there is also an opportunity to seamlessly narrow the support band for a product.  While the benefits are numerous, this newfound efficiency comes at a cost   2. Availability Demands  The increasing dependence on this new platform 
 world has begun to create a requirement by customers that these services should be no different than electricity or telephone service, a world where consistent availability is traditionally both expected and highly valued.   As a response Software as a Service \(SaaS\sinesses must often compete with each other not only on the relative feature functionality merits of their product, but also on the service availability.  They have begun to vie for the most 
number of 9s of service availability, with some touting availability numbers near or at the telco grade standard of 99.999%.  Service availability is typically calculated as some variation on the formula  Availability = \(service time downtime\vice time 100     Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


Table 1:  Availability as a unit of downtime allowed per measured period Availability  Downtime Per Week Downtime Per Month Downtime Per Year 95 8.4 hours 36 hours 18.25 days 99 1.68 hours 7.2 hours 3.65 days 99.9 10.1 mins 43.2 mins 8.76 hours 99.99 1.01 mins 4.32 mins 52.6 min 99.999 6.05 secs 25.9 sec 5.26 secs  Each increase in the number of 9s dramatically reduces the amount of downtime allowed.  Most high end hardware vendors, having years of experience with the telecoms industry, typically aim for a Mean Time Between Failure \(MTBF\at achieves the telco 5-9s of availability \(99.999%\et The challenges of high software uptimes are many Software must run on hardware, and thus must deal with the cumulative MTBF of all the underlying components.  In addition, while development and quality control practices within the software industry are relatively nascent compared with that of hardware such practices are still embryonic on the Internet delivery platform.  In order to overcome these challenges, some providers have begun to borrow from the tenets of Lean Manufacturing that were first pioneered by Toyota for automobile manufacturing The Toyota Production System \(TPS\bines management philosophy and practices to form an integrated socio-technical system that, like the SaaS enterprise, demands high quality products delivered just in time.  It organizes all aspects of the business to design out overburden muri consistency mura  and eliminate waste muda   On e o f  h e  k e y s i s  to create a system that can see correlations between events and propose some procedures and changes that can allow some prediction of the future.  This paper will walk through the core tenets of Lean and how they can be applied to the SaaS  3. Poka Yoke Mistake Proofing  Most common quality problems are caused by inadvertent mistakes.  The concept of Poka Yoke is to put mechanisms in place that either makes mistakes impossible to perform or otherwise make it impossible to not immediately notice them when they occur.  A common example in the physical world is that of 3.5  floppy disks, which are designed so that the disk can only be inserted into a drive one way Lack of reproducibility is one of the biggest scourges to ensuring software quality.  Unfortunately much of this has been brought upon by many common practices in the industry.  These include software often being developed, compiled, tested and deployed manually in environments that were at least in part built by hand.  Even in more mature organizations it is not uncommon for development, test and production environments to vary in sometimes unknown or irreproducible ways.  Dependencies across environments are often hard to track if tracked at all Software is sometimes designed to modify itself and/or the environment it is on upon installation.  Worst of all traditional development methodologies like Waterfall encourage releasing large bundles consisting of multiple components all at once.  These big birthlike events often have so many moving parts that deriving the effects of a change make troubleshooting problems difficult, and without careful and considerable effort often ma ke rollback prohibitive There is considerable value in mistake proofing  the whole software development lifecycle, especially for an SaaS.  Unknown or unnecessary variances in an SaaS environment not only can affect service quality but also availability.  Variances also challenge service integration efforts.  Many useful systems should be put in place that not only reduce the possibility of inconsistencies, but also can help make it easy to understand and reproduce environments quickly across the entire software lifecycle.  These systems should span the technology stack, as well as the software lifecycle. Operating system installation tools such as Solaris jumpstart or Linux kickstart, and automating build tools like CruiseControl or Hudson are already commonly used tools for fully automating commonly repeated tasks in an easily annotated, reproducible and versioned way.  Asset databases that may already exist within an organization can be used to track hardware components and variances, when paired with monitoring and incident data they can help find potential problem areas or bottlenecks in infrastructure Investments in better atomic packaging, automated deployment and configuration tools, and intelligent test automation take this even further.  Atomic packaging provides versioned, self contained packages that can be independently released and rolled back easily and cleanly.  Automated deployment and environment management tools should understand versions and role relationships between packages and environments.  It should deploy and configure packages atomically and in an automated fashion, and should have the ability to regularly audit software manifests and configurations to ensure compliance between what is installed and the models stored in the environment management database.  When both are combined with test automation, changes can be made, tracked and tested quickly and in a focused manner.  Errors and inconsistencies can be located quickly and corrected Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


At Yahoo, such systems not only condensed the duration of testing and integration cycles from often weeks to hours, but reduced the number of cycles required while significantly contributing to adding over one 9 of measured uptime across business units that adopted them As such systems are deployed two benefits become immediately apparent.  The first is that it becomes far easier to permit a steady stream of product improvements, as there is both confidence in the configurations of development, test and production environments, as well as it becomes easy and straightforward to release a nd, if required, roll back changes quickly. Secondly, the automation and configuration databases dramatically reduce the amount of staff overhead required in order to manage the infrastructure.  A single engineer can build and release to thousands of systems instantly and accurately, as well as later verify that the services are operating correctly and rollback as necessary Companies such as Google and Yahoo! have been able to obtain ratios of thousands of servers running hundreds of services handling millions of requests per engineer through such mechanisms, allowing their organizations to scale in ways that are otherwise conventionally impossible  4. Jidoka  Stop the Line Autonomation  While the tools of Poke Yoke go a long way to preventing errors, failures are still inevitable.  To preserve high availability, protect customers  businesses and data, and to bolster customer confidence that their interests are being well looked after, SaaS providers must find and quickly correct any faults.  Traditional manual recovery methods are expensive and error-prone, and without the right protections do not necessarily find and resolve the root cause.  Anyone who has been told to reboot or restart an application without any explanation or further resolution only for the problem to return later can certainly relate Jidoka is best described as automation with a human touch Simple automated restarting of failed processes, or tools that only provide heuristic data alone rarely provide sufficient information to find and eliminate the root causes of errors.  Methods such as code hooks and other instrumentation within the software that provide transparency into the overall health of the application, as well as defensive programming techniques that encourage graceful failures and provide effective artifacts for both troubleshooting and future testing, not only help improve the speed of problem resolution but also provide valuable data that can be fed back into the software lifecycle to improve mistake proofing  There are other incredibly valuable data sources that are often not tracked or otherwise carelessly ignored A professional technical operations team that manages the running of a service can provide incredible depth of knowledge of the operational health of a product These staff members are the closest thing to having customers on staff, as the quality of the operational health of the product will directly affect these people first.  Continued collaboration during product development can provide clues to areas of concern that can be proactively targeted.  Incident tracking and trending, as well as site performance numbers operational load to break and failure mode testing can be complied into a health dashboard that can help spot problem areas and technical debt.   Teams that implemented such measures typically added one to two 9s of availability to their products.  They were also able to confidently increase release velocity from months to weeks or days, and were able to target far more effective functionality goals for these releases  5. Kaizen Continual Improvement  Tracking failure only provides one useful dimension to the relative quality of a product.  If implemented well, the SaaS model also provides unique insights that, when leveraged with the big picture of other metrics across the software lifecycle, can provide a plethora of information to better target resources and improve the customer experience.  Having the data is not enough, and many organizations are already overwhelmed by what they have or improperly focus on minutiae.  Instead, a systematic approach that encourages continual experimentation, and a holistic view across the entire product and the organization around it is the key to a high performing SaaS The philosophy of kaizen is that of continuous proactive improvement through all aspects of life.  It considers both the results as well as the process so that the actions that achieve the effects, whether good or bad, are surfaced.  It is also non-judgmental and nonblaming.  It is critical that staff or customers should not fear that they will be censured as it breaks trust and often causes people to hide or obfuscate facts A huge advantage of the SaaS model is that it allows for unobtrusive observation of how services are being used.  A provider can understand what flows and features are more or less popular, and can observe performance and interaction characteristics that can be used for business and technical planning.  If the architecture accommodates and the requisite work has been done to gauge software quality, experimental Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


bucket tests can be run that seamlessly redirects a small number of targeted users towards newer or different functionality or configurations and receive immediate feedback.  This is of tremendous value over waiting for feedback after a release as it can allow for engineers or business people to change course and reduce waste far more rapidly Haphazard data analysis and experimentation can be both dangerous and cause businesses to move in a direction counter to their best interests.  The entire organization, from technical engineers to business analysts to Finance, needs to work together collaboratively using a deliberate scientific approach Key metrics across the software and business lifecycle should be exposed and correlated.  Incidents and performance issues often correlate to build health and bug counts.  Revenue from certain features may not justify the capital or operational costs associated with them.  If installations or upgrades are slow or painful it might provide certain insight on how quickly the organization can react to new business demands or major shifts in the industry.  The term Internet time  where radical industry shifts and events happen in highly compressed periods of time, has been batted around for a while and is very real.  Scientific experimentation and correlation allows organizations to be more nimble, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and provide measures to technical business, financial and procedural decisions that can be made readily available to key organizational stakeholders There are some basic practices that nearly any technology company can start with.  The first is to look for opportunities to obtain fresh perspectives on the state and sanity of key elements of the business.  The Toyota Production System actively looks to eliminate anything that does not advance the process.  It does not settle for eliminating the waste that everyone recognizes as waste. Many people resign themselves to certain problems, or have become hostage to routine and abandon the practice of problem solving.  There are many ways to see if complacency has grown in an organization.  Can someone unfamiliar with the business come in and with little direction quickly understand the health of the codebase, infrastructure and current projects?  Can they quickly understand the value the business provides to its customers?  One test that can be implemented is to have new hires install configure and use product\(s\with little to no assistance beyond what documentation might be available, and afterward capture their impressions, focusing particularly on what things were bad, weird or unexpected.  Similar things can be done by having employees trade duties, even for short periods of time Providing channels for people to share ideas understand the challenges of the business, and try to find ways to fix them is critical Finally having the means to experiment in nondisruptive and nondestructive ways is key.   It is perhaps the most difficult piece to get right as it requires alignment across the organization and an acceptance that not all experiments will succeed  6. Just In Time  Few SaaS have traffic patterns that are flat and predictable.  They will typically experience regular load peaks and troughs, with occasional traffic spikes that seem to come out of nowhere.  A SaaS must deal with these traffic shifts transparently in order to ensure acceptable service responsiveness and availability.  A business can decide to provision ahead of time for the worst case scenario.  Unfortunately, their best guess might be wrong, and the costs of acquiring and maintaining the usually idle resources can be prohibitively expensive.  Also, traffic patterns and the demands across the infrastructure will change as software and the customers using it are added or change their behavior, meaning that any specialized configurations tightly tied to key components might only provide transient value and not be flexible enough for their added costs.  Means must be put in place to minimize the waste while maximizing the ability of the SaaS to respond quickly to these demands The concept of Just In Time is to flexibly deploy resources as they are needed and no sooner.  Amazon and Google have both introduced the concept of cloud computing to the mainstream.  Clouds are in essence similarly configured servers that work in unison to provide computing resources to the applications running on them quickly and efficiently.  This building block approach allows for services to be scaled up or down quickly, much like Lego bricks.  While Amazon and Google have built rather sophisticated software to manage their clouds, the underlying concepts of modular architecture in its simplest form can be applied to any SaaS.  Software architecture decisions that require lots of specialized systems should be carefully studied as they greatly reduce flexibility and introduce waste Just In Time is particularly effective when used in conjunction with Jidoka, Kaizen and Poka Yoke.  As seen earlier, Jidoka and Kaizen provide useful mechanisms to understand and respond to changes quickly, and Poka Yoke can instill useful mechanisms that speed the accuracy and delivery of deployment When used together with a modular infrastructure signals of traffic imbalances can trigger automated or guided intelligent reconfiguration of the production Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


environment that shift resources from other parts of the environment to alleviate load and mitigate failures.  An added benefit is if traffic patterns follow a daily sinelike curve, batch and offline jobs can be run on dynamically reconfigured production systems in off hours.  Other services which have inverse load profiles can also similarly benefit As organizations become much more sophisticated this model can allow for resources to be brought to bear only as they are needed.  Services and resources could be requested and leased for defined periods This can be useful for infrequently used services, and is ideal for development and test where resources and environments might be dialed up from a reconfigurable pool where they can be returned afterwards on demand.  Decisions can also be made at the last moment of how to optimally manage resources as which ones to run serially or in parallel.  At Yahoo such measures allowed in several cases for a reduction of hardware footprint of 60-80%, while allowing for far more dynamic and complete testing and more timely response to radical traffic spikes, both planned and unplanned  7. Conclusion  The challenges of the SaaS model will continue to force organizations to look for new ways to produce high quality services more efficiently and more rapidly than ever before.  The techniques found in the Toyota Production System and Lean Manufacturing provide a useful guide for both large and small businesses that can be adapted and followed throughout the software lifecycle  10.

5 EVALUATION Evaluation experiments described in this section are conducted on a TI OMAP 1511 Innovator device which runs in frequencies up to 200MHz. It has 32MB ROM as well as 32MB RAM. The OS used is a version of embedded Linux, and the JVM used is Intent from TAO Group The source documents and stylesheets used for evaluation are randomly selected from Sarvega’s XSLTBench and DataPower’s XSLTMark [17  after initially excluding some unrealistic transformations. We select these two benchmarks as they are influential indust ry benchmark and that they both support XSLT benchmarking. Note that some of the large source documents are less likely to have recurrent structures in real-world applications. We included them regardless as they might help us understand the implication of document size on system performance. Table 1 lists sizes of sample documents and the transformation stylesheets used for them. Table 2 lists the raw numbers used in following discussions Documents are fully read into memory before any measurement starts to minimize external disturbance Warm-up runs are always conducted prior to real measurement runs 5.1 Tokenization Figure 12 compares the speed of Swift mode and Hash mode against the speed of Nature mode tokenization The Swift mode is by far the fasted, having a median speedup of 2.40 over Nature mode. The median speed of Hash mode is about 81% of that of Nature mode which means a median hashing overhead of about 23.5%. In the worst case, this overhead is about 37.4 for wai  5.2 DOM-style Parsing Figure 13 and Figure 14 compare speed of Structure Encoding based parsing against that of kXML parsing for both Receiver ID Assigning and Sender ID Assigning. In Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while in Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses Swift mode when cache hit ratio is 100% \(i.e., structure of incoming document is always in cache\ode when cache hit ratio is 0 Figure 13 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed is 4.34 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 1.35 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is in backwords and game which use the same source document\to 8 under Sender ID Assigning Figure 14 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 1.07 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.90 \(or an overhead of %11.1\ID Assigning is used. The worst sample is wai where the overhead is about 20.5% under Receiver ID Assigning. The reason Figure 12. Comparing Performance of Tokenization Modes Figure 14.

that Structure Encoding is a little faster than kXML even when cache hit ratio is 0 is likely because of the fact that, while we use kXML for tree building, we modified it slightly to interface it with our tokenizer which resulted in differences in execution traces and slight differences in runtime performance when execute in JVM Overall, these two figures demonstrate that Structure Encoding based parsing provides substantial speedup when structure recurrence is frequent, and incurs low overhead when such recurrence is rare 5.3 Transformation Similarly, Figure 15 and Figure 16 compare transformation speed of Structure Encoding based XSL processor against that of XT for both Sender ID Assigning and Receiver ID Assigning. Again, under Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while under Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses either Swift mode or Nature mode Figure 15 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed of Structure Encoding based implem entation is 5.38 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 2.72 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is trend  where the relative speed is over 39 for Sender ID Assigning, and over 25 for Receiver ID assigning Figure 16 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 0.996 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.918 or an overhead of 8.9 is used. The worst sample is nitf-stylized where the overhead is about 14.6% under Receiver ID Assigning These two figures show that Structure Encoding based XSL processing offers even higher potential speedup than parsing, yet incurs lower overhead in worst cases This is understandable as, typi cally, a large portion of operations in transformation is for costly structurerelated operations, which we have pre-processed offline. Note that, as long as structure recurrence is frequent, the potential improvement is very high \(up to a median relative speed of 2.72\even if the receiver has to calculate structure ID through hashing 5.4 Compression We conducted an experiment to examine the effectiveness of Structure Encoding based compression. In the experiment, for each sample document, we randomly changed the values of 3 rd 8 th  13 th i.e., one in every 5, starting from the 3 rd  attribute and text node values. Thus our experiment Figure 16. Comparing Structu re Encoding Based Transformation and XT  Cache Hit Ratio 0  Figure 15.

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didn’t measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

Our current implementa tion does not support documents with “variable-le ngth arrays” – lists of identically structured elements with non-fixed lengths Otherwise identically structured documents with different array lengths are currently considered as having different structure We are currently working on supporting “variablelength arrays” to extend the applicability of Structure Encoding.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
