For a payload with good resolution, pointing stability is a key performance metric. However, as spacecraft inertia decreases, the payload line-of-sight stability becomes increasingly susceptible to disturbance inputs. In addition, as spacecraft agility increases there is a corresponding increase in disturbances from attitude control actuators SpaceDev has developed a 6-DOF measurement platform known as the Hexapod Reaction Balance, to accurately measure disturbance inputs from attitude actuators. It is based on 6 force transducers that are mapped to force and moment measurements at 10 kHz. In addition, we have created a technique for reducing the data in the frequency domain and applying it to spacecraft structural models to predict system jitter This paper discusses the system wide issues of creating a jitter prediction in the context of the SpaceDev Trailblazer satellite, which includes 4 reaction wheels as disturbance inputs and a finite element model of the structure. Data collection, data reduction, system modeling, and typical results are presented. 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1. INTRODUCTION.............................................................1 2.

INTRODUCTION SpaceDev has designed a 6-DOF Hexapod Reaction Balance, commonly called the Hexapod, to accurately measure force and torque disturbances. The Hexapod was originally developed to support test and verification of a two-axis gimbal that was designed and built for JPL  s Deep Impact mission launched in 2005. The gimbal was driven by two stepper motors and an accurate measurement of force and torque disturbances was required to verify spacecraft system stability. The Hexapod, gimbal, and inertia simulator test assembly are shown in Figure 1 In addition the Hexapod was successfully used to measure the stepper motor induced disturbances for NGST  s NPOESS Preparatory Project and BATC  s Orbview-5 program. Most recently, the Hexapod measured the disturbances from the reaction wheels used on SpaceDev  s Trailblazer spacecraft The focus of this paper is on the Hexapod Reaction Balance and analytical extensions to the component-level results that 


and analytical extensions to the component-level results that can be used to predict system-level performance. The paper  Figure 1. Photo of Hexapod Reaction Balance and Deep Impact High Gain Antenna Gimbal Hexapod gimbal inertia simulator x y z 2 begins by describing the design and physical characteristics of the Hexapod, discusses frequency response analyses for both the Hexapod and spacecraft structure, and concludes by presenting a technique for combining component-level responses with flexible-body modes to predict system-level performance. This discussion is presented in the context of reaction wheel disturbance effects on payload jitter for the SpaceDev Trailblazer spacecraft 2. HEXAPOD REACTION BALANCE The Hexapod consists of two parallel plates which are supported by six leg assemblies. Each leg assembly has steel flexures and piezoceramic force transducers. Figure 2 is a close up view of one of the leg assemblies Piezocermaic transducers enable high measurement bandwidth and good resolution. In addition, the flexure assembly maintains high axial stiffness and minimizes offaxis stiffness The orientation of the six-leg assemblies allows for a straightforward kinematic transformation from leg force measurements to 6-DOF force and torque estimates in the Hexapod  s coordinate frame. The transformation has the following form                           6 5 4 3 2 1 F F F F F F 


F A M M M F F F z y x z y x  where A is the 6x6 transformation matrix, Fi is a vector of 6 force measurements from the 6 leg assemblies, and the vector on the left hand side of the equation contains force and moment. The Hexapod coordinate system is located on the upper surface of the interface plate with +Y normal to the plate, as shown in Figure 1. Table 1 summarizes the performance metrics for the Hexapod Table 1. Hexapod Reaction Balance Properties Property Value Torque resolution 0.2 mN-m Force resolution 2 mN Maximum static torque 100 Nm Maximum static force 1300 N Transducer bandwidth 0.01 - 36 kHz Stiffness normal to interface plate 200 N/?m Unloaded first resonance 800 Hz  The capabilities of this instrument have led to its use in verifying disturbance loads for many subsequent actuation systems, such as the NPOESS and Orbview-5 stepper motors. The bandwidth and resolution also make it well suited to the disturbance measurements required by the jitter prediction methodology described here 3. FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS Once data has been gathered from the hexapod it can be transformed into the frequency domain using standard Discrete Fourier Transform techniques [1]. The DFT of a series of time domain data, x, of length N, is 1,,0,1 1 0 2    Nkex N X N n N knj nk    where capital letters indicate frequency domain variables and lower case letters represent time domain variables Figure 3 shows a typical DFT of torque measured by the Hexapod about the Hexapod +Y axis due to a reaction wheel spinning at 100 rad/sec. Notice that the DFT magnitude is drawn using a log scale  Figure 2. Detail View of Hexapod Reaction Balance Force Transducer Leg flexures force transducer

Disturbance Inputs 4 Using Figure 3 we can see that this wheel has the largest disturbances at approximately 250 Hz and approximately 700 Hz. The same disturbance information is often represented in terms of its spectral density \(sometimes called power spectral density or PSD  computed from the DFT via 1,,0    Nk f XXS kkX k   where X* is the complex conjugate of the DFT and f is the sample frequency. Figure 4 shows the PSD of all 3 force and 3 torque disturbances in the Hexapod frame generated from the wheel spinning at 100 rad/s 


from the wheel spinning at 100 rad/s To complete the analysis one must calculate the DFT over the range of speeds that the RWA is likely to encounter on orbit. The result is a three-dimensional data structure consisting of frequency, wheel speed, and reaction magnitude. In the literature plots of the three-dimensional data are sometimes called waterfall plots An example waterfall plot is shown in Figure 5 for the same wheel. This plot shows torque disturbance about the Hexapod +X axis. This wheel has an operating range of approximately +/-1000 rad/sec. This data set was sampled at 10 kHz, so its Nyquist frequency is 5 kHz. Figure 5 is restricted to 1.5 kHz because the DFT at higher frequencies is generally small in magnitude for this wheel 4. STRUCTURAL FREQUENCY RESPONSE ANALYSIS In order to determine the system-level response to component-level disturbances, we must first investigate how the disturbances propagate through the spacecraft body and into the payload. If the spacecraft body were perfectly rigid, the angular acceleration of the payload would be directly proportional to the disturbance torques, which can result in significant accelerations for low inertia spacecraft Fortunately, flexibility in the spacecraft structure often provides damping between the disturbance source and the payload A standard technique called Frequency Response Analysis 1000 500 0 500 1000 0 500 1000 1500 5 4 3 2 1 0 Wheel Speed \(rps FFT, Torque about Hexapod +X Axis Frequency \(Hz lo g 1 0\(N m Figure 5. Waterfall Plot of +X Disturbances 5 3] was used to determine the transfer function between forces and torques at the actuation point in the spacecraft and the resulting angular displacements at the payload. This analysis identifies the amplitude of the response to a sinusoidal input. The equation of motion for the spacecraft structure is assumed to be             t j U e X K X B X M         Where M is the mass matrix, B is the damping matrix, K is the stiffness matrix, U is the load vector, and X is the displacement vector. Notice that for frequency response analysis, the load vector is assumed to be harmonic Through Normal Modes Analysis [3], the system can be transformed from physical coordinates to modal coordinates, such that the equations become independent and uncoupled in the frequency domain   iii i i kjbm uq 


    2 where m, b, and k, are diagonal matrices that represent modal mass, damping, and stiffness; respectively. The modal response for each frequency, ?, can then be transformed back into physical coordinates A finite element model of the Trailblazer structure was created and analyzed in Nastran using 28,339 nodes. The results of the frequency response analysis are shown in the following transfer function, which shows angular displacement about the spacecraft +Y axis, taken at the payload node, for a unit force directed along the spacecraft X, +Y, and +Z axes \(Figure 6, upper plot originates at a specific node which is coincident with the placement of a reaction wheel. The response of the spacecraft about the +Y axis due to torques about +X, +Y and +Z are shown in the lower plot. Similar plots were generated for the response about the spacecraft +X and +Z axes \(not shown 10-1 100 101 102 103 104 10-15 10-10 10-5 100 Structure Transfer Function Along BF+Y due to Force Freq \(Hz ra d N   X Y Z 10-1 100 101 102 103 104 10-12 10-10 10-8 10-6 10-4 Structure Transfer Function About BF+Y due to Torque Freq \(Hz ra d N m    X Y Z  Figure 6.

JITTER PREDICTION System-level jitter can now be predicted by combining the frequency domain analyses for all reaction wheels \(Section 3 finite-element frequency response analysis \(Section 4 analysis sequence is shown in Figure 7 For a given reaction wheel speed, 6 PSDs \(force and torque along each axis are multiplied by the structure transfer function to determine the PSDs in terms of angular displacement \(jitter assume that each disturbance is independent, then we can sum all the PSDs to determine the total jitter caused by a single reaction wheel. This is extended to compute systemlevel jitter by summing over the PSDs for each actuator in 


level jitter by summing over the PSDs for each actuator in the spacecraft system 6. EXAMPLE RESULTS The disturbance inputs shown above were applied to a finite element model of the Trailblazer spacecraft. The jitter prediction is shown in Figure 8 as a PSD. In this figure the jitter about the payload cross axes \(+Y and +Z in the spacecraft body frame In this scenario, four reaction wheels are present. Three are aligned with the spacecraft body frame and the fourth is skew. The wheel speeds are [+10, -10, +750, +10]T rad/sec The spacecraft coordinate system is very close to the principle frame, and the main diagonal of the inertia tensor is approximately [10, 10, 5]T kg-m2. One might expect the Z line-of-sight motion to dominate due to the large wheel speed and low inertia. However, Figure 8 shows the opposite. The explanation is due to the structural transfer function. It is several orders of magnitude larger in +Y than in +Z 7. CONCLUSION Combination of a Hexapod Reaction Balance with appropriate frequency domain analysis yields a powerful tool for spacecraft jitter prediction. Candidate actuators can be characterized on the hexapod and their disturbance inputs to the spacecraft structure can be evaluated. Results as shown in Figure 8 can be generated quickly for any combination of actuators, actuator orientation and location and structural model 8.

By continuing with grounding her rejection in Arvid Lerviks role as superordinate, and even copying him in, she shows that she has Lervik on her side This strengthens her authority and makes it difficult for Engseth to reject the decision 5 Discussion 5.1 Summary The analysis of the Agenda-leaders communicative actions showed that she uses different discursive devices in in-group and out-group communication When writing messages to the Agenda-group, she mostly uses an informal style and does not make explicit relevant leadership categorizations Requests are performed with positive politeness strategies \(closeness strategies and indirect strategies\gnaling a socio-emotional, personal relationship with her subordinates. On the contrary when writing messages to out-group partners, the leader uses a more formal style and makes hierarchical categories relevant. Requests are performed with direct strategies, grounded in her position as a leader or with reference to her superordinates wishes The Agenda leader predominantly uses a rhetoric which creates a positive and attractive image of the group. The analysis identified three devices which contribute to build up the groups image. First, by using addressing devices and positive loaded nick-names she compliments \(and categorizes\e members and invites them to identify with the picture/category she presents Second, the leader makes use of metaphors as narrating devices. Metaphors as blessing journey and blessing round contribute to creating a picture of the team as main characters in a successstory. In addition, by using metaphors from economics \(to sell in Agenda\e leader compares Agenda with a valuable product. Finally, the Agenda leader provides feedback to the group by informing that they have attention from the topleaders. To have the top-leaders attention may signal that the groups work really is making a difference in the huge company. Providing this information may be a performance management device h ic h m i gh t serv e t o  stren gth e n  relatio n s  inside the team. In sum, the rhetorical devices which the Agenda-leader uses in her in-group communication contribute to creating a positive image of the group. She presents the group as being enthusiastic about their work and as being valuable for the company, something which may invite to group identification, establish involvement, trust and maybe increased participation Despite that all the members of this distributed group belong to different departments, and in addition other distributed work groups in the company as well, it seems that the leader manages to create an image of Agenda as a unique group. It may even be associated with what Bell and Kozlowski refer to as a third cultur   However, to confirm this, the groups actual perceptions of being members of the group need to be examined through interviews. This has not been the purpose in the present study. A great part of the leaders messages to the group are requests.

she performs requests, she does not explicitly make her role as the leader explicitly relevant. Rather, she compensate for the request by using positive politeness strategies. This corresponds with Mullany \(2004\d the findings in the Language in the Workplace project [20, 26 By  u s i ng closeness strategies, the Agenda-leader presupposes common ground and familiarity, something which makes her appear as an egalitarian leader who trusts her team members and encourages them to act independently Despite the fact that the leader of Agenda by linguistic form appears as egalitarian and present in in-group communication she constitutes herself more as an authority towards externally co-workers When writing messages to out-group partners, she tends to use a more formal style. When performing requests, she uses more direct strategies and ground the requesting acts in her position as a leader, or refers to super-ordinates. By referring to hierarchical roles, she is making power categories overtly relevant. This may be an effective device to pursue a quick compliance to a request. Second, the Agenda-leader makes hierarchical categories explicitly relevant when managing conflicts This study has primarily shown that the Agenda-leader does not make hierarchical categories relevant when writing messages to the team-members. Her authority is downplayed, or back grounded, in favor of an emotional, personal relationship with her employees. These findings illustrate Fairhursts point that hierarchy categorizations often are unspok h e Agenda-leader Line Myhre does not need to explicitly qualify herself as a leader each time she posts a request. Her appointed role as the leader of Agenda gives her an exclusive right to perform requests and the members are obliged to comply. In addition, the institutional role is enacted implicitly by the rhetorical devices identified in this study Her leadership role is constituted by and through the actions which she performs. Evaluating motivating and requesting are leadership actions 36  W h e n Li ne M yhr e p o s ts me ssa ge s to o u t group co-workers, she does not have the same exclusive right, or can not take for granted that the recipients will comply with her requests, since she is not their leader. Therefore, the requests need to be grounded in her institu tional role, or anchored in her super-ordinates wish 5.2 Doing leadership is building trust The leadership carried out in Agenda seems to a great extent to be grounded on trust. In the present article, this has been exemplified by the addressing devices, the nick names, and the leaders use of positive politeness when performing requests A characteristic of virtual teams and computermediated networks is that boundaries are permeable, interactions are with diverse others connections switch between multiple networks, and hierarchies can be flatter and recursive \(\he community exists more in the informal networks than predefined work-groups. Rather than fitting into the same group as those around them, each person has his/her own personal community [37   Wellman \(2001\ers to this phenomenon as networked individualism ris k  w i t h t h e  networked individualism is that the social life at the work place may be fragmented, and that no one fully knows each other Where person-to person community is individualizing, role-to-role community deconstructs a holistic individual identity A person becomes only the sum of her roles, and there is the danger of alienation The compartmentalization of personal life within the household and within the community  may create an insecure milieu where no one fully knows anyone Wellman 2001:17 The leadership practices carried out in Agenda which is grounded on trust, may demonstrate an attempt to reduce these risks As mentioned in the review, one of the challenges for leaders of virtual teams is to duplicate the two key functional leader roles to the virtual team \(team development and performance management\ According to Bell and Kozlowski [6  this includes the leaders need to closely monitor any changes in environmental conditions Additionally it includes to motivating team members to commit strongly to the overall team effort and need to facilitate team coherence especially under high intensity conditions. In virtual teams, as in Agenda where people only rarely meet face-to-face, these functions are challenged. However, the leader seems to attempt to create a positive climate in the group, both by rhetorical devices as giving the group a nick-name and by providing receipts and acknowledgements in third position responses. These characteristics belong to the team-development function addition, arranging regular face to face meetings belongs to the performance management function Conclusively, the leader seems to duplicate both of the important leader functions Computer-mediated communication provides great opportunity for leaders to send out important information, request and monitor their members Even though the team-members are physically distant, the technology facilitates constraint-free communication and hyperconnectivity, i.e. the availability for people to communicate anywhere and anytim ai l  m a y f o s t er s o cial  presence in a greater extent than face-to-face, in the sense that e-mail messages are persistent and thus Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 
 


having more pervasive force. This makes it possible for leaders to appear powerful, even on a distance Interestingly, with respect of the amounts of messages, the reminders and extent of feedback [29  e A g e n da leader appears as a po w e rfu l  leader, displaying her hierarchical position in the group. Simultaneously, her methods of creating in group solidarity and performing requests, shows that her institutional role is back grounded as she enacts egalitarian leadership building socioemotional ties within the team 6.

Sees the big picture while at the same time demonstrating an overall awareness of the details 225  Breaks the problem down into smaller manageable parts 225  Understands how the system works, what it was designed to do, its functions and 


  14 requirements. Is able to analyze the systems data. Traces implications of a problem in a step-by-step manner across the system Has the Ability to Find Connections and Patterns Across the System 225  Integrates and provides a connection between the various engineering segments of the project.  Is able to identify c onnections from separate elements of the project that others would not notice and brings these connections to the team's attention as a means to assist in solving underlying issues 225  Examines and explores the implications of how technical decisions being made affect the bigger system architecture Sees the ripple effect of changing requirements or making changes to any element of the system 225  Able to see system interfaces. Identifie s the impact that changes to one subsystem are having--or might have--on other sub-systems.  Locates and corrects sub-system 'disconnects' or 'inconsistencies' that are having a negative impact on system performance Sets Priorities 225  Sets technical priorities in order to maintain the balance for the problems at hand while achieving system requirements Keeps the Focus on Mission Requirements 225  Is focused on developing a system that meets the end-item product objectives and does not lose sight of this while integr ating the pieces of the system into the whole system 225  Studies, understands, and articulates the project\222s overall objectives.  Knows what the system must do and be in order to accomplish its objectives 225  Sets technical priorities with principal investigator and subsystem engineers to achieve system requirements Possesses Creativity and Problem Solving Abilities 225  Enjoys and is energized by fully concentrating on a problem for long stretches until solutions are formed and implemented. Possesses passion for problem solving 225  Takes the initiative to solve the problems 225  Solves problems with the team by listening to the issues, pinpointing problem areas, making technical recommendations; may help implement the solution 225  Does not adhere to rigid rules or formulas for system design, but may create new ideas and approaches that are necessary to deal successfully with system constraints Validates Facts Information and Assumptions 225  Breaks data into smaller pieces or parame ters.  Prioritizes the parameters then synthesizes the data to reach an answer or solution by examin ing system and subsystem operations in minute detail.  Recognizing that seemingly minor miscalculations can lead to signifi cant problems in system performance 225  Questions all assumptions that go into the design 225  Looks for, and anticipates, problems or issu es in the system in places that may not be covered with the right kind of data to make a decision 225  Looks for answers that may not be readily apparent from just looking at the data alone.  Does not rely solely on data Remains Open Minded and Objective 225  Receptive to hearing diverse varying opinions.  Is willi ng to re-think/re-work an issue or to change direction when new information or a better idea is presented 225  Evaluates decisions objectively.  Maintains flexibility by avoiding 'ownership' of a particular strategy or point of view Draws on Past Experiences 225  Draws from his or her hands-on experiences to develop the proper feel for succeeding on future projects, knowing when something looks "ri ght" versus "not even close\223 from past successes and failures 225  Solves problems with a balance of innovative developments and proven heritage products.  May rely on experience and ex isting design as guides, but sees each opportunity as a canvas to design new solutions 225  Uses experience, history, intuition, and se nsing in order to assess the situation and develop a solution Manages Risk 225  Uses past experiences to anticipate pot ential problems that may impact system performance 225  Identifies the key indicators and methods of testing for each type of problem
