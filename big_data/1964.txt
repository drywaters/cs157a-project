  1 LIDAR versus Satellite-Measured Optical Thickness of a Wildfire Aerosol David S. Stoker, Gilda Fathi, Pavel Ionov, Steven M. Beck The Aerospace Corporation 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd El Segundo, CA  90245 david.s.stoker@aero.org  Abstract 227A dual UV, Rayleigh/nitrogen Raman LIDAR system was developed for the purpose of profiling aerosols at vertical ranges between 0.025 and 5 km.  The 355 nm LIDAR was operated in El Segundo, California during June and July 2008, during a period of intense wildfire activity in Northern California 1,2 From the two independent measurements we calculated th 
e particle backscatter, and using the humidity-correct ed LIDAR backscatter-toextinction ratios given by Ackerm  we cal cul a t e d aerosol optical thickness \(AOT\rofiles.  Preliminary validation studies revealed th at under most conditions the calculated LIDAR AOT data agreed with total AOT measured from a collocated sun photometer, except for cases when high-altitude smoke from wildfires was present To account for high-altitude smoke, a two-layer atmospheric model was assumed, where the lower layer\222s AOT was calculated using the backscatter-to-extinction method and the high-altitude AOT was found through direct attenuation of the Raman signal.  A comparison of AOT measurements from the ground-based LIDAR and the

While the LIDAR and Sun Photometer were found to be in good agreement, it was found that the MODIS overpasses consistently indicated a larger AOT  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  M ETHODS 1  3  R

differentiate clouds from aerosols \226 usually by identifying and removing areas of high scatter that also have high levels of water vapor.  It is assumed, however, that vertical aerosol 1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09 25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1415, Versi on 6, Updated Nov 2, 2008 distributions are homogeneous \226 something that is often not the case.  In fact, this case is certainly violated in areas such as Southern California where coastal marine aerosol layers may be superimposed with wildfire smoke plumes.  Such a scenario is not uncommon and inconsistencies between ground-based and remote satellite measurements are often 
observed.  While non-uniformities in background are known to play a role in the accuracy of MODIS optical depth in the western US, we would also like to know the effect of vertical aerosol inhomogenaeities on AOT retrieval accuracy.  In order to answer th is question it is necessary to establish a reliable ground-based data source that can independently measure AOT and identify whether there is an inhomogeneous aerosol layer  A number of methods exist for quantifying AOT and because they utilize different a pproaches, they tend to have different accuracies and biases, and they behave differently under different atmospheric conditions.  For instance LIDAR, because it is an active remote sensing approach, is most sensitive at night when solar background radiation is low.  Sun photometers, on the other hand, operate best at 
midday when the sun is brightest.  These measurement techniques, when combined with a satellite observation comprise a set of orthogonal approaches that can provide an approximation of the true AOT, and can be used to determine conditions under which one or more may deviate 2  M ETHODS  The general approach of the study involved establishing a self-consistent ground-based AOT measurement that could also be used to detect vertical aerosol distributions.  For the AOT measurement, we used a CIMEL sun photometer identical to those used with AERONET[2].  To detect the vertical distribution of the aerosol layer, we used LIDAR 
First, agreement between the ground-based LIDAR and the sun photometer was established.  Following that measurements were made prior to and during a period of time in July 2008 when a wildfire plume originating in northern California was observed in southern California Because the methods of sun phot ometry as well as remote satellite observations of AOT have been treated extensively in other documents, this section focuses on the steps required in order to achieve agreement of the ground-based sensors.  Furthermore, because the method used to extract AOT from the LIDAR data relied on assumptions inherent in Mie calculations, we used the initial comparison between 


  2 the LIDAR and the sun photometer as a means to estimating the type of aerosol in the LA basin and the accuracy of the chosen Mie parameters.  As a result, what follows in this section is primarily a description of the LIDAR apparatus and the data reduction procedure. Instead of solely measuring the aerosol optical thickness by comparing the experimental nitrogen backscatte r \(which measures the total molecular and aerosol losses\comparing it to the theoretical molecular backsca tter, we used an extraction method that uses a lookup table to determine the optical thickness from aerosol backscatter.  For the lookup table we used the maritime LIDAR ratio, corrected for relative humidity and wavelength developed by Ackerm   The LIDAR was based on a 355 nm, tripled YAG laser source and a 30 inch Cassegrain receiver and has been described in detail elsewhere.  The system has been described el The det ect or was confi gured t o  measure both Rayleigh \(355 nm\nitrogen Raman scattering \(387 nm\ypical return is shown in Figure 1 The Rayleigh backscatter clearly shows the presence of the aerosol layer through an increase in the backscatter signal with respect to molecular scattering.  The Raman backscatter is primarily determined by the density of nitrogen in the atmosphere \(which falls off in altitude\ut any optically thick aerosol layers will show up as an additional decrease in the return from higher altitudes.  Both the Rayleigh and Raman signals are lower at close range due to a lack of overlap between the telescope field of view and the transmitted beam  The aerosol backscatter was obtained by dividing the two LIDAR returns to produce the LIDAR backscatter in units of molecular backscatter intens ity which is useful because it is not affected by the low altitude overlap function.  The normalization was performed in \221clean air\222 conditions near 5 km.  Figure 1 shows the value of C\(z 1, the experimentally determined particle backscatter in units of molecular backscatter, plus the molecular backscatter.  This value along with the particle to backscatter ratio are needed to calculate optical depth of the aerosol layer  The particle scatter must be combined with the LIDAR ratio in order to determine the AOT.  The LIDAR ratio is a parameter that relates the attenuation of an unknown medium to the backscatter intensity[4 is essen tially is related to the scattering angular distribution, or phase function.  If the exact particle shape and index of refraction were known, one could use Mie theory to calculate the phase function, or exact distribution of the scattering.  In practice, extinction is smaller than predicted by Mie theory because of the forward peaking of the scattering coefficient and forward scattered photons never actually leave the beam.  Also, sideways scattered photons may scatter a second time and return to the beam.  Such a calculation has been performed for mixtures of typical aerosols in order to determine the LIDAR extinction to backscatter ratio.  The LIDAR ratio of desert aerosols has been verified in experiments[5 Th e ratio fo r m a ritim e aero so l s h a s b een  measured to be much larger than those predicted by calculations[6  In  th e case o f so m e m aritim e aero s o l s, th e mean LIDAR ratio at 532 nm was found experimentally to be closer to 60, not 20 as predicted by Ackerm The discrepancy may be due to regional compositional differences and further study is clearly needed in order to determine the correct LIDAR ratio for all conditions and locations  Figure 1 Typical pair of Raman eigh  backscatter returns.  Also shown is the derived backscatter ratio   The LIDAR ratio \(extinction to backscatter pp 002 003  which is known quite accurately to be 8.4  The first experimental step involved isolating the backscatter.  It was advantageous to have both the Raman and Rayleigh scatter at nearby wavelengths, which ensured that the molecular extinction wa s the same in each return Because attenuation was the same for each, dividing the 002 003   where p stands for particle, was used to compare the measured backscatter to the ex tinction of a Nd:YAG laser The type of aerosol was most important for determining the value of the LIDAR ratio.  In the case of this study, a maritime aerosol was expected, which has four main components: water soluble soot, and the accumulation and the coarse mode of sea salt.  For this aerosol, Ackermann calculated a LIDAR ratio to be between 20 and 24 for typical levels of humidity.  As a comparison, a desert aerosol was reported to have a larger LIDAR ratio closer to 50.  As a figure of merit, these numbers can be compared to the extinction to backscatter of Rayleigh scattering from atmospheric molecules RR

The green data are from sun photometer measurements taken in the early morning  Rayleigh scatter by the Raman scatter produced a curve that was equal to unity everywhere that molecular scattering took place, and slightly greater wherever aerosol scattering occurred.

The result was then compared to local simultaneous measurements of AOT from the sun photomet The resul t s of t h e com p ari s on are shown i n  Figure 2.  After performing wavelength corrections, good agreement was found between the instruments when the sun was near zenith.  However, during sunrise and sunset deviations were often observed which were attributed to the fact that the LIDAR was not sa mpling the same parcel of air unless the sun was directly overhead  Using the mechanism above allowed us to accurately measure temporal changes in AOT with high resolution under typical marine aerosol conditions in Southern California.  However, during the June 2008 Northern California fires, we measured significant deviations between the LIDAR and the sun photometer \(Figure 3 deviation was caused by the smoke having an effectively different LIDAR ratio compared to the marine layer.  To account for the difference, we separated the return into a low-altitude response \(taken to be below 1 km\was assumed to behave as a marine layer, and a high-altitude response. Instead of calculating a separate LIDAR ratio for smoke, the upper layer was assumed to have an unknown LIDAR ratio  and the known molecular Rayleigh backscatter-to-extinction ratio were used to determine the particle extinction coefficient 4.8 CS Rp 002\002 002  The ASR is useful because it removes the significan ce of small changes in the shape of the overlap function that occurred from slight alterations in beam pointing, and furthermore, it automatically normalizes the data by the actual molecular extinction profile  The first step to AOT retrieval was to calculate the particleto-molecular backscatter 1 212 Rp zC  


  4  Figure 4 \(a\-altitude \(<1 km\as measured using the aerosol backscatter \(b 1 km, circles\the theoretical molecular and experimental Raman returns above about 1.2 km To account for the AOT of the upper layer, the Raman LIDAR return was compared to a theoretical molecular LIDAR return at the same wavelength as shown in Figure 4 The difference between the tw o was used to measure the optical depth of the suspended aerosol directly.  When the higher altitude channel was added to the AOT calculated from the marine layer below 1.0 km, a much better agreement between the sun photometer and LIDAR was obtained, as shown in Figure 3.  The fact that the two-layer model showed a significant improvement in the fit to the sun photometer measurement was an indication that the suspended particles had a much larger LIDAR ratio  The two-layer method was used to calculate AOT from the LIDAR data under all conditions.  In all measurements concurrent data was acquired from the sun photometer Ground-based temperature and pr essure data were acquired with a collocated weather station \(Vaisala WTX-501 which was used to make humidity corrections to the atmospheric index of refraction and fed back into the LIDAR backscatter-to-extinction model  Measurements were performed during the late morning and early afternoon at times corresponding to the MODIS \(Aqua and Terra\overpasses of Southern California, between about 18:00-22:00 UTC.   M ODIS optical densities were acquired from the NASA MAPSS \(MODIS Aerosol Products Subset Statistics\ine database, derived from collection 5 of the level 2 data 3  R ESULTS  During the period of intense wildfire activity in Northern California, between 19 June 2008 and 2 July 2008 a distinct smoke plume was observed in the LIDAR backscatter ratio  Figure 5 Particle backscatter \(in units of molecular scatter er aerosol \(below 1.0 km an elevated smoke plume at ~ 2.0 km as shown in Figure 5, and remained clearly visible for several days.  During this period the measured sun photometer AOT was compared to the MAPSS AOT data for UCLA, reported at 550 nm.  The sun photometer data was not corrected for wavelength, but rather the closest wavelength \(500 nm\o the reported MODIS data was selected.  The results of the comparison are shown in Figure 6\(a\he sun photometer data clearly tracked to the MODIS AOT values, though overall the sun photometer reported consistently lower values.   This was true even for the sun photometer\222s 550 nm measurements.  Because optical densities will increase monotonically with shorter wavelength, an adjustment from 500 to 550 nm will show an even larger discrepancy between the MODIS and sun photometer AOT  LIDAR-derived AOT values were also directly compared to MODIS AOT data, with similar results, as shown in Figure 7\(b\ Because the LIDAR AOT was measured at 355 nm the Deep_Blue_Angstrom_Exponent was used to convert the Aqua and Terra AOT to 355 nm.  The Deep Blue Angstrom Exponent was derived, as the name suggests from measured AOT close to UV wavelengths between 412-470 nm.  Prior to using the deep blue values, the Angstrom Exponent for 470-670 nm was used in the sun photometer comparisons.  The Deep Blue exponent was on average about 1.6 times larger than the visible exponent Even when the visible exponent was used, we found that the scaled AOT values from 550 nm were larger than the ground-based measurements  In all the data, the LIDAR data, sun photometer, and MODIS values correspond to temporal uncertainties no less than 20 minutes.  Having good temporal overlap was essential, as large changes in AOT values were observed in as little as 30 minutes 


  5  Figure 6 Intercomparison of AOT measured by sun photometer and MODIS Aqua/Terra during the presence of wildfire smoke Particle mass data from the South Coast Air Quality Management district that corresponded to the time when the smoke plume was observed in Southern California were also examined.  Hourly Beta-Attenuation Mass Monitor BAM\2.5 readings were found to be roughly unchanged during the period of peak AOT measurements from 24 June to 26 June  4  C ONCLUSIONS   For ideal marine climate conditions, the Ackermann model for the LIDAR ratio was successfully applied to calculate vertical optical depth distributions from aerosol scattering ratio profiles.  We found that good agreement between sun photometer and LIDAR was obtained under those conditions when the aerosol distribution was uniform However, in cases where the marine climate was not ideal the Ackermann model was useful only at low altitudes  When the LIDAR ratio of aloft material was unknown, as in the case examined in this repor t, the AOT must be measured directly.  Direct AOT measurements at low altitude are not  Figure 7 LIDAR vs. MODIS AOT values observed between 19 June and 2 July 2008  trivial, because they require comparing the experimental Raman return to a theoretical 221pure\222 molecular scattering return \(accounting also for Rayleigh attenuation\ the low altitude return is plagued by the overlap factor which is difficult to quantify and can change on a daily, if not hourly basis.  Direct measurements tu rned out to be straightforward because the aloft material wa s well-above the point where the LIDAR overlap function reaches unity.  At low altitudes, the Ackermann approach was preferred because it required knowing only the ratio of two of the LIDAR quantities that shared a common overlap factor, and as a result the measurement becomes insensitive to even large instabilities in pointing that otherwise would be a detriment to a purely direct measurement of AOT via a single Raman LIDAR  AOT profiles are particularly useful for characterizing air quality in the western US where heterogeneous boundary layers are common.  In the case of forest fires, total column AOT measurements may indicate high levels of particulate matter, but without the vertical profiles available with 


  6 LIDAR, one doesn\222t know if they are contained in the mixing layer or above it.  In general, aerosol vertical profiles provide more information on where/when upper tropospheric and stratospheric plumes \(such as Asian yellow dust and wildfire smoke\er into the boundary layer and become a health risk.   In this study, we found that the smoke plumes had an immeasurably small impact on air quality, even though there was a cl ear increase in the remote measurements of AOT  Acknowledgements This work was sponsored by The Aerospace Corporation's Independent Research and Development Program  R EFERENCES  1.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.

 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.  In the figure, nearly two hundred 2-Gbit NROM devices are installed on each face of the 9U card.  \(The whitespace is preserved in this example for passive components and design margin.\e time of this writing, the availability of chip-stacked NROM devices was uncertain and omitted from the trade space Design of a Flash-based memory card would be of similar ilk.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
