  1 Memory Technologies and Data Recorder Design Karl F Strauss Senior Member IEEE  Jet Propulsion Laboratory 4800 Oak Grove Drive Pasadena, California 91109 US  karl.f.strauss@jpl.nasa.gov  Abstract 227Missions, both near Earth and deep space, are under consideration that will require data recorder capacities of such magnitude as to be unthinkable just a few years ago Concepts requiring well over 16,000 GB of storage are 
being studied.  To achieve th is capacity via \223normal means\224 was considered incredible as recently as 2004.  This paper is presented in two parts.  Part I describes the analysis of data recorder capacities for missions as far back as 35 years and provides a projection of data capacities required 20 years from now based upon missions either nearing launch, or in the planning stage The paper presents a similar projection of memory device capacities as baselined in the ITRS \226 the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.  Using known Total Ionizing Dose tolerance going back as far as a decade 
a projection of total dose tolerance is made for two prime technologies out to the year 2028 Based upon the two prime technologies, the design of a 130 Tb recorder is discussed in Part II.  Further, it is noted that for all the missions and t echnologies analyzed, the parameters of a recorder \226 mass, power, volume \226 remain constant despite ever-increas ing capacity requirements          1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2

of data recorders for deep sp ace, Earth orbiting, and Lunar missions commencing from the year 1967. This information is augmented by the inclusion of missions still in the planning stage and the curren tly-allocated data recorder size 1  H ISTORY OF D ATA R ECORDER C APACITY  Eighteen NASA, JPL, JAXA, and ESA deep space missions were analyzed as far back as 1973 \226 the series of Pioneer  JPL CL#08-4253 


 2  missions \226 specifically Pioneer 11, launched April 1973, to study the survivability of the interplanetary asteroid belt and to assess the radiation belts surrounding Jupiter 3   Presenting this information as a graph \(Figure 1\e readily seen that the trend \(shown in Green\deep space missions is to have a doubling of on-board data capacity at a rate approximately every three years  Tape Recorders \226 not without problems Up through 1990, th e spacecraft examined used multi-track tape recorders.  The largest tape recorder \(in terms of data capacity\aunched was the 1.8Gb, 12-track behemoth used on the Magellan mission to Venus.  The Magellan recorder featured over one-half mile of precision Mylar tape.  These precision mechanisms were not without problems \226 culminating in the near loss of the Galileo mission in October, 1995, due to a position encoder error compounded with electrostatic bu ild-up on the tape\222s surface.  From that point on, all missions \(that is to say, all missions examined have utilized solid state recorders \(SSRs Solid State Recorders \226 A Watershed Moment NASA\222s first mission using a solid state data recorder was the Cassini mission launched in 1997.  It features a 2 Gb SSR consisting of 640 specially screened DRAM devices and eight full custom ASICs.  With the advent of the Cassini recorder, two trends emerged.  First was the use of solid state devices for data stor age and the second was the abandonment of the so-called 223Mil-Grade\224 product by most   3 Pioneer 11 ceased transmitting to Earth March 1997 semiconductor manufacturers.  The latter required the development of additional procedures to \223up-screen 4 224 commercial devices to what is termed pseudo-mil.  Often this involved the development of a partnership with the device manufacturer to ensure that the devices chosen screened, and accepted were manufactured at the same time and often from the same wafer lot The use of commercial devices was both a bane and a blessing.  The bane was two-fold.  One, as memory devices were no longer made for sp ecific space-\223type\224 capability \226 such as temperature or radiation \226 a survey of many devices from many manufacturers wa s required.  These surveys involved at least two types of expensive radiation testing \226 Total Ionizing Dose \(TID\nd Single Event Effects \(SEE Complicating the issue, more often than not, manufacturers would alter various manufacturing settings \(such as ion implant depth\hieve better commercial yields, and these changes, however minor, would completely invalidate previous Radiation Lot Acceptance Testing \(RLAT Therefore, this brought in the second complication: the partnering with manufacturers.  This was rarely successful as semiconductor manufacturers are generally not set up to provide customers with lot-sp ecific data.  Therefore, socalled lifetime buys were instituted with random parts being examined internally for monitoring of certain on-die   4 The term \223up-screen\224 refers to a process wherein a set of commercial devices receives extra examination as far as quality and operational parameters are concerned often over a set of voltages and environments in excess of what the manufacturer states the device is designed for.  The \223upscreening\224 may include the use of X-Ray or Ultrasonic based inspections additional radiation testing, and involves the destruction of a sub-set of the devices for physical examination at an Electron Microscopic level Figure 1 - Historical & Projected Spacecraft Data Recorder Capaci ty by Launch Year.

This added greatly to the cost of the recorder 2  A N E XAMINATION OF S OLID S TATE D EVICE H ISTORY  The blessing is that as the semiconductor industry matured and developed new, aggressive products, the design of a recorder often went with it.  Intel founder and chief scientist Gordon Moore \226 then working for Fairchild Semiconductor 226 predicted in 1965 that, essentially, the number of transistors per fixed die size would double roughly every two years to thirty months [1  d a te, the Indu stry h a sn 222t  proven him wrong  [2   Of the thirteen solid-state based data recorders analyzed nine of them are based upon Dynamic Random Access Memory \(DRAM\ or Synchronous DRAM \(SDRAM technology and its variants.  The remainder are based upon non-volatile Flash.   The predominance of DRAM can be attributed to the general ability of DRAM devices to have a higher total ionizing dose tolerance than Flash \(discussed later in this paper MEMORY TECHNOLOGY Of all the devices needed to operate a computer, especially a computer in a space environm ent, space-specific memory technologies have received th e least amount of institutional development.  While commercial technology is achieving density and power reductions unimaginable even a few years ago,   space-specific memory is several generations behind.  Commercial Flash t echnology embraces 4 and 8 Gbits per single die \226 the latest space-rated non-volatile technology is 4 megabits \(Mb\\226 more than three orders of magnitude smaller Non-Volatile technologies  Non-Volatile Memory technology today consists of the following Rotating, Mechanical 227Hard Disk Drive, Optical Platter DVD, CD  Hard Disk Drive 227 Current technology supports 500 GB per platter, Figure 2  Despi t e a succes sful research study undertaken for the Prometheus/JIMO program, due to the competitive nature of the industry, no supplier willing to support this effort has been located  Figure 2 - Hard Disk Platter with Cantilever \(courtesy Seagate   Optical Platter 227Current technology supports 50GB per platter  [4 Du e t o th e co m p etiti v e  n a ture of t h e industry, no supplier willing to propose a rad-tolerant optical platter design has been located  Solid State 227Ferroelectric \(FeRAM\Magnetic MTJ MRAM\, Ovonic \(CRAM\, Trapped Charge \(ONO Nitride-oxide memory  Ferroelectric \(FeRAM 227 In this technology, an Oxygen atom is positioned within a perovskite matrix usually consisting of Lead, Zirconium, and Titanium \(PZT The position of the Oxygen atom is sensed as a positive or negative charge within the matrix, Figure 3   A limiting factor in Ferroelectric is the destructive read out nature of the device.  In this method, any knowledge stored at the cell must be disturbed during the read operation; this then requires a re-write of data which is one more stresscycle to the chip.  The mo st common issues are data retention \(relaxation of the position of the Zi \(or Ti and data imprint \(a tendency of the covalent bonds to prefer that the Zirconium atom remain in the previous position of the crystal The highest capacity devices are 4 Mb per die  Magnetic MTJ \(MRAM In this technology, two layers of magnetic metal, such as cobalt-iron, separated by an ultrathin layer of insulator, typically aluminum oxide Figure 3 - Operation of FeRAM \(courtesy Carnegie Mellon Data is stored as a shift in the Zi \(or Ti\tom within the perovskite bond.  As a result of the shift, the cell is either positively or negatively polarized 


 4  Information is written by injection of electrons directly through the thin \(typ. 1nm\ insulating layer.  Determination of the 1/0 state of a cell is achieved by sensing the reluctance to lightly imposed cu rrent flows in the direction of \226 or in the direction opposite to \226 the stored magnetization in the so-called \223free\224 magnetic layer Figure 4\  [5 A limiting factor in MTJ memory is the current required per bit to impose magnetic spin into the Free Layer.  The most common issues are adjacent bit flip \(field confinement and electro-migration. As with the aforementioned FeRAM these devices, too, are low density \226 also 4 Mb per die Likewise, these were not c onsidered for the HC-SSR discussed in Part II  Figure 4 - Operational Principle of MTJ Device courtesy EverSpin\agnetic lines of force between currents flowing in the Digit Line and the active Bit line imposes magnetic spin into the device\222s 221free layer.\222  Resistance to cu rrent flow \(read cycle\is determined by parallel or anti-parallel lines of force between the pinned layer and the free layer Phase Change 227In this technology the physical state of a plastic-like material is cha nged from an amorphous to crystalline state and back by controlled, direct heating of the memory bit being addressed.  The resistance of the material varies by many orders of magnitude \(Figure 5\ This large spread in resistance makes it easy to discern between a One and a Zero data state  Figure 5 - Phase Change Resistance versus Temperature Profile \(courtesy BAE Testing has shown that the data storage material is immune to strategic radiation, and therefore is a prime candidate for this application \226 as increases in radiation tolerance at the device level brings about a decrease in the amount of radiation shielding required A limiting factor in Phase change memory is the energy heat\ required in order to liquefy the memory cell Typically this is one milliwatt per bit, with cell temperatures reaching 230 Celsius, Figure 6  Figure 6 - Activation Energy versus State of an Ovonic Cell \(derived from Ovonics The main issue with Phase Change memory is the large activation energy \(E A the amorphous high resistance A is computed to be approximately 2.7 eV; an external application of heat may result in loss of data at the cell The densest available Phase Change device today is 4 Mb  Trapped Charge 227Several technologies are available under this category in which a charge \(electron or proton\ped within the crystalline structure of an Oxide at an interface site.   For this paper two technologies were investigated: Flash and NROM Floating Gate \(Flash 227 Non-volatile memory devices have traditionally relied on floating gate technology.  A floating gate memory cell contains an electrically isolated gate, a floating gate \226 below the standard control gate and above the transistor channel. \(Figure 7\ The floating gate is composed of a conducting material, typically layer of polysilicon.  The floating gate memory device stores information by holding electrical charge within the floating gate.  Adding or removing charge from the floating gate changes the threshold voltage of the cell, thereby defining whether the memory cell is in a \223programmed\224 or \223erased\224 state [7 Free Layer  Pinned  Layer Ea ~ 2.7 eV 


 5  A limiting feature in the Flash technology is the necessity to overcome large energy barriers to impose a charge or remove it \(erase\In all devices on the market today, this is done by on-chip generation of a relatively large voltage typ. 10 \226 15 V, sometimes as high as 25\ to bias the substrate and achieve Fowl er-Nordheim tunneling This action stresses the oxides leading to an accumulation of defect sites that eventually renders the cell useless.  Typical device lifetimes are reached after 100,000 erase cycles  Figure 7 \226 Typical Floating Gate Memory Cell [courtesy Saifun Semiconductor  The largest available Flash device today is 8 Gb per die Nitride \(NROM 227 NROM technology contains a nitride layer which traps or stores the charge, instead of a floating gate above the cell.  The nitride layer is surrounded by two insulating silicon dioxide layers. \(Figure 8 arge may be accumulated and confined at each end of the nitride layer, effectively storing two separate and independent charges.  Each charge can be maintained in one of two states, either \223programmed\224 or 223erased,\224 represented by the presence or absence of a pocket of trapped electrons The limiting factors in NROM devices are, similar to Flash large voltages \(in this case 8V\ssary to achieve a write and the very small number of electrons \(sometimes as low as 6\used to signify data which can lead to unusual Single Event Upset \(SEU The largest NROM device available today is 1 Gbit per die this is not a reflection on the capability of the technology merely a reflection of the newness of it 3  S OLID S TATE T ECHNOLOGY B ASELINES 226  THE ITRS The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors ITRS\s a compendium of ex haustive research into the technology trends for the semiconductor industry [9  Updated yearly, the ITRS iden tifies emerging technologies as well as tracks technologies widely in use today Technological advancements are predicted and identified on a year-by-year basis for nearly two decades hence A study of the ITRS for the memory technologies identified above reveals, as expected a doubling of bits-per-die capacity every 30 or so months.  The ITRS does not outright predict that a particular technology will double its capacity rather, the prediction is borne out by an investigation of the feature size and cell-to-cell pitch.    Further, some devices will be implemented with multiple bits per cell \(example Figure 8\\226 with four bits per cell being typical in 2009 this, too, being identified in the ITRS A very telling story of expected device capacity is shown in the Figure 9 Figure 8 - Typical NROM Cell Construction [Saifun N o te th at the  device typically stores two-bits per cell

The grap h shows that the feature size for the listed technologies \(NAND Flash, NROM Ferroelectric, MTJ MRAM, Phase Change\duces at an exponential rate, with a reduction by a factor of 2 approximately every 30 months.  \(Left axis, arrows pointing to Left\ This follows Moore\222s Law The graph also shows that th e Write Erase Voltage \(Right axis, arrows pointing to Right\reduces as well.  This is an important factor as it indicates that the operating power for a system will be reduced from one generation to the next when considered on a per-bit basis The graph concludes with an estimation of per-die data capacity when considering feature size reduction and active die area. \(Heavy green and red lines, Left Axis Flash Currently available si ngle bit per cell Flash devices reach a capacity of 8 Gb per die.

 8  Radiation Tolerance by Feature Size Feature size is the semiconductor industry term for the general length of a source-drain channel in a single MOSFET transistor.  In general, the total dose radiation tolerance of a semiconductor \(or microchip\ncreases as feature size de is is mainly due the thinner oxides used to form the gate of a MOSFET transistor \226 the thinner gate results in dram atically fewer places for free electrons to become entrapped in crystalline defect sites This, in turn, reduces the ability of the transistor to be controlled and, eventually, would lead to a circuit becoming inoperable as intended, usually with serious system consequences A previous development of JPL is the X2000 series of nonvolatile memory cards.  Each card contained twenty Samsung 128Mbit Flash memory devices.  These devices were manufactured with 300nm design rules \(feature size and an oxide thickness of 90 Angstroms.  Testing performed by JPL showed these devices maintained operation within specification to approximately 15 kilorads for the specific environment and operational  By comparison, testing a 4 Gbit Flash memory [1 manufactured at 90 nm feat ure size showed normal operation to 100 krads.  From there , total dose tolerance has increased dramatically regula rly achieving 200 krads [15  16 r 65  n m   A plot of Feature Size and Total Dose tolerance is included as Figure 14.  One should note that the total dose tolerance of any device studied is dependent upon operational function prior, during, and after exposure.   It is conceivable, and normal to have a single device, tested many times and many ways, to have varying total dose capability An excellent treatise on the control of radiation effects through design and processing can be found in [17  A chart representing launches \(and planned launches\rsus measured and expected \(for years 2009 and beyond radiation tolerance for Flash and NROM technology devices is included as Figure 15.  Note that NROM device technology flat-lines at 1 Mrad \226 this is based upon a business model by the supplier not to pursue capabilities in the multi-Megarad regime at this time This chart reveals that for all the missions studied --- save for one --, the use of storage devices manufactured without any special radiation processing is adequate.  One must read this with a good amount of caution as the radiation capability of any technology beyond the year 2009 is highly speculative but is intended to indicate an increase in total dose tolerance as device features continue to shrink Figure 14 - Total Dose Capability and Feature Size note CY2009 and beyond Speculative Figure 15 - Mission Radiation requi rements and Technology Capability 


 9  according to Moore\222s Law Therefore, the selection of Flash and NROM devices will more than suit all mission needs.  The sole outlier here is the Jupiter Europa Orbiter mission which requires devices capable of operating after megarads of exposure Flash\227 Due to decreased feature size, Flash devices of higher density will experience greater total ionizing dose tolerance and, conversely, experience a high upset rate of data or control information caused by the SEFI 5 phenomena 1   Current radiation tolerance is in the realm of 100 krads to 200 krads [19 Th is is no t a resu lt o f sp ecial d e sign  but  rather the normal increase of total dose capability due to processing, as discussed earlier in this paper NROM\227 NROM is currently the only technology supporting high capacity designs in which the vendor has agreed to develop devices that will perform to radiation immune levels.  Testing on existing commercial samples reveals radiation tolerance to 200 \226 300 krads. By design levels exceeding 1000 krads  o mmercial parts  tested have proven to be latch-up free when exposed to heavy ions at a fluence level of 5 x 10 5 ions/cm 3 at an LET of 58 MeV/mg/cm 2 20 Ad d ition ally, and p e rh ap s m o re importantly, \223NROM technology has an inherent immunity to failure due to point defects in the gate dielectric layer Electrons \(or holes\re trapped individually\205 NROM technology does not suffer from charge loss   5 Single Event Functional Interrupt \226 a loss or unexpected change of state of a device often by a charged particle upsetting a latch or register within the device\222s state machine CRAM\227 By design, this technology handily maintains normal operation in an environment exceeding 1000 krads 22 Fo r ex t r em e en v i ro nmen ts, u n til o t h er techno log i es are funded and move forward \(e.g. NROM alternative 5  A  N EW M AXIM  One will note that the evidence suggests a certain exponential growth exists for the required data volume of data recorders.  Further, that by its very nature, the semiconductor memory industry is matching such needs with ever increasing density of its products. \(Figure 12 Including the desired Recorder capacity, by Year, gives us the Figure 16.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.  In the figure, nearly two hundred 2-Gbit NROM devices are installed on each face of the 9U card.  \(The whitespace is preserved in this example for passive components and design margin.\e time of this writing, the availability of chip-stacked NROM devices was uncertain and omitted from the trade space Design of a Flash-based memory card would be of similar ilk.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
