The schemas employ genetic algorithms base on a steady-state strategy and two disjunctive data sets will he used to verify fitness function for our approach In this study, 904 schemas were found, and nearly half of the said schemas reached confidence of 70% and higher. Finally, the paper concludes with some illustrations of significant schemas produced as plirt of this study, with brief explanations of their significance Index Terms - I machine learning; steady-state genetic algorithm; pattern finding; association rule mining: secondary protein structures I. INTRODUCTION The latest version of the Protein Information Resource PIR updated on Dec, 9 2002 protein sequences. In comparison, the Protein Data 'Bank PDB much more difficult to determine. The secondaq structures of proteins are now considered crucial to understanding their tertiary Structures [l,  2, 3, 4, 51; however, even though secondary structure data is often used in protein recognition and protein structure 'prediction -[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 111, few attempts have been made to determine shared secondary structure patterns. Based on studies describing statistical regularity between single amino acids and various secondary structures [12], some researchers have suggested that secondary structure formation may, at least to a certain degree be determined by sequential amino,acid interaction [ 131. Here we'will  propose a representative schema for amino acid interactions as an aid for analyzing the relationship between them and various protein secondary structures A schema can he regarded as a sequential pat-tem. In its general definition, a sequential pattern means frequently occumng patterns related to time or other sequences, and schema differences are often expressed in terms of positions Agrawal and Srikant introduced the concept of mining sequential patterns fr0m.a set of market-basket data [14 Sequential pattern mining methods make use of variations in A priori-like \(statistics-based searchers using different parameter settings and constraints 15, 16, 17, 181. But there is still no related research on our problem yet. On the other hand, association analysis is the discovery of association rules showing attribute-value conditions that occur frequently together in a given set of data A pattern in the Association rule mining dose not follows any specific sequential order, which differs from sequential pattern mining. Thus, more general pattems can be found with association rule mining. Traditional statistical methods identify significant patterns or rules ac-cording to their frequencies in data sets; in contrast, a schema also considers distinguishability. Hence, we will use association rule mining to find some pattems in our data set for comparison. By this we will not only get a comparison with our method but also emphasize the significance and necessity of distinguishability in a schema In the absence of a widely applied data mining method we adopted a genetic algorithm based on a steady-state 


we adopted a genetic algorithm based on a steady-state strategy [19]. This approach is based on genetic algorithms as described by John Holland [20], whose work is associated with natural selection principles. The computational aspect of this method, which entails a great deal of random searching, is considered both effective \(because of its fitness function flexible \(be-cause of its problem encoding capability 23, 24,251. We adopted a genetic algorithm approach for two reasons: a considers frequency and distinguishability \(as opposed to traditional data mining methods that emphasize frequency only which lack crossover and mutation operators more useful in determining regularity over a training set 11. METHODS A. Schema Protein secondary structures are generally designated as H \(alpha helix, 3/10 helix, pi helix beta bridge, beta ladder turn, bend  the behavior of any amino acid in a protein sequence is susceptible to adjacent amino acids, hut little work has been done to identify the regularity of these interactions. To address this problem, we applied Holland's schema theory [20], with the use of schemas to reflect the regularity. A schema is a bit string in which a bit is either an amino acid or an asterisk that represents any amino acid. Figure 1 shows an example of a schema in which the first and last positions are both amino 0-7803-8273-0/04/$20.00 02004 IEEE 2104 acid A, and amino acid L is in the center. Currently, we only focus on schemas of nine amino acids in length A.**L H  Fig. 1. Schema example Secondary. s'tructures are thought to be related to molecular interaction; a schema represents the most stable molecular configuration in terms of Van Der Waal's forces and hydrogen bonds. The schema in Figure 1 could he associated with the helical structure, which may be determined by interactions among the amino acids A \(first position middle position final position identify significant schemas that can be used to characterize various protein secondary struc,tures. This is a non-trivial task be-cause a the schema length is variable, and c evaluate. the schema's quality I I I '  0 + Ex h.a c t i n g Fig. 2 Methodology used in this research B. Algorithm A decision was made to use steady-state Genetic Algorithms \(SSGAs they are frequently used in rule-based systems [27] and schemas can be considered a form of rules. Each schema that evolved was used to classify the secondary structure of a protein sequence. As shown in Figure 2 ,  the schemas were encoded into the SSGA population. During the evolutionary process, schema that matched the established criterion were organized into a schema set and used to analyze protein secondary structure regularity in terms of its primary sequence patterns The framework of a SSGA in our study is illustrated in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3, a chromosome C l  is first Randomly Select Crossover Mutation Compare with fitness Fig. 3 .  SSGA flowchart  2105 20 Populations far 20 amino acids 


20 Populations far 20 amino acids Fig. 4. A sample population for amino acid R randomly selected from a populatio5 C1, will be either mutated or crossed oyer a .  second randomly selected Chromosome to yield C2.  A chromosome C3 that is most similar to C2 is then taken from the population for comparison. The one with better fitn5s will survive to the next generation There are several components in our system. They are chromosome encoding, population initialization, fitness function and genetic operators To reduce the computational complexity, in-stead of using a single huge population of chromosomes, we initialize a population for each amino acid. In a particular population for amino acid, e.g. R, each chromosome represents a potential schema of nine amino acids in length with the amino acid, R, fixed at the center position, while the others randomly determined. The reason we fix R at the center of the schema in this case is that we try to model the interactions between the center R and the other neighboring amino acids. During the evolution process, the genetic operations, i.e., mutation and crossover, apply to all positions except the center to maintain the specificity of the schemas in each particular population An illustration of the 20 populations under consideration is presented in Figure 4. Each schema is associated with a specific secondary structure determined by its fit-ness The design of our fitness function is based on the fact that there is a correlation between the primary sequence and the secondary structure it forms. To evaluate the fitness of a schema, s, we first measure its tendency toward each secondary structure, defined as follows where tendency\(s particular secondary structure ss\(H, E or L the alignment score between schema s with a secondary structure ss and the ith schema of ss in the training set SAssmax and SAssmin mean the maximum and minimum alignment scores respectively. Note that we only consider those alignments with scores' above a specified threshold Alignments with low scores are considered noise We prefer schemas' with greater discrimination power that is, a good schema should have a strong tendency, a significant difference in ,value between the highest and the second highest tendencies, toward a particular' secondary structure. Given all the tendencies toward various structures we define the fitness as where Tendency\(s s the highest and the second highest tendency of schema s respectively We adopt a steady-state selection mechanism to choose candidate schemas to participate in evolutionary process Standard genetic operators such as uniform crossover and multi-point,mutation are applied to generate new populations The same evolutionary process is repeated until the fitness values of.schemas do not improve. After the convergence from all the twenty populations, we combine those schemas with high fitness values to form the final significant schema set. These schemas can then be used to classify the secondary structures of new protein sequences Table 1.

III. EXPERIMENTS A .  Methodologv and Data sets There are two purposes of our experiments. First, we want to verify the confidence value of ow system; second, we want to validate the fit-ness function. As our system is within the supervised leaming paradigm, 'we prepared the training set and testing set respectively. The training set consists of 124 protein sequences each of which has more than 80 amino acids in length, and the painvise similarity is below 25 similar to RS130 [13 significant schemas associated with various protein secondary structures. The 124 proteins are listed in Table 1. To obtain the confidence and support value, we tested SSGA on the N PDB data set created by NCBI after removing those sequences used for training. If A B is a probability of both A and B. The confidence and support value are defined as B is the form of rules, and P\(A confidence \(A - B B I A number of correct classifications \(3 number of schema matches number of correct classificaiions \(4 support \(A j B Au B number of secondarystructure matches From large databases, biologists have found that there exists some preference of secondary structures for each amino acid. We thus looked into the finally converged twenty populations for similar correlations. The similar correlations may suggest that the fimess function we used can approximate real biological meanings so as to justify its usage B.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
