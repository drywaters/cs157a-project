A Simple Algorithm for l, d Motif Search 1   Dolly Sharma, Sanguthevar Rajasekaran 247   Computer Science & Engineering, Universi ty of Connecticut, Storrs \226 06269, CT, USA  247 Corresponding Author   Abstract Extracting meaningful patterns from voluminous amount of biological 
data is a very big challenge. Motifs are biological patterns of great interest to biologists. There are different versions of the Motif Finding Problem. In this paper we concentrate on the Planted l, d f Search Problem. There have been numerous algorithms designed to solve this problem. Many instances of the Planted l d f Problem have been identified as challenging instances. The algorithm 
proposed here is an extension of PMS3  It uses a very simple approach and solves challenging instances 21, 8\or example that have not been reported solved before in the literature. We also propose a new algorithm PMS3p. We expect PMS3p to be significantly faster than PMS3   I  BACKGROUND  1 Genomic sequencing allows the identification of nearly all of the genes in an 
organism, from which the potential gene products can be inferred. However, genomic sequencing does not provide direct information on the function of the individual gene products, nor their interrelationships Motifs provide clues on this function. Several computational approaches for identifying motifs can be found in the literature. These   1 This work has been supported in part by the following grants: NSF 0326155, NSF 0829916 and 
NIH 1R01GM079689-01A1  techniques differ in how motifs are defined and modeled. Each approach looks at a different facet of motifs. No single model or technique can identify all possible motifs The final verification, as to whether a motif is functional or not, can only be assessed experimentally Since experiments are expensive and time consuming computational techniques that can select potential functional motifs with high accuracy are desirable 
Three versions of motif search have been identified in the literature: planted l, d  search \(PMS\t distance based motif search \(EMS\and simple motif search SMS\In this paper we focus on PMS. PMS algorithms have been employed to solve various biological pr oblems. For example Buhler and Tompa  have emplo y e d PMS algorithms to find known transcriptional regulatory elements upstream of several 
eukaryotic genes. Eski n and Pevzner [6 used PMS algorithms to find composite regulatory patterns; and so on Problem Statement  The l d\otif problem takes as input n sequences each of length m Input also are integers l and d The problem is to find a motif M a string of 
length l that occurs in each input sequence up to hamming distance of d  Numerous algorithms have been developed to solve PMS. PMS algorithms can be categorized into two, namely exact algorithms and approximation algorithms An exact algorithm \(also called an exhaustive 


enumeration algorithm ways finds the correct answer\(s\the other hand, an approximation algorithm may not always output the correct answer Some examples of algorithms proposed for PMS are Random Projection  M I TRA  6   W i nnower 7    Pattern Branchin g  8    PMS1 [1 PM SP [9   CE N S U S  1 0   a n d  Voting s e  a l g o r ithms CENSUS, MITRA, PMS1, PMSP and Voting are exact algorithms Certain instances of PMS have been identified to be challenging instances In particular, an l, d motif instance is said to be challenging if the expected number of motifs that occur in the input by random chance is greater than or equal to one \(when the input sequences themselves are generated randomly\. For example the instances \(9,2 13,4\ and \(15,5\e examples of challenging instances. It is customary in the literature to show the performance of PMS algorithms only on challenging instances. It is always a challenge to solve as large a challenging instance of PMS as possible. The largest instance reported solved in the literature thus far is \(19, 7 o r the  f ir s t time, in this paper, we present an algorithm that can solve the \(21,8\nstance. Before presenting details on our algorithm we summarize some of the prior algorithms Pevzner and Sze [7 have propos ed the  WINNOWER algorithm. It generates a list of all the l mers present in the database and constructs a graph out of them. Each l mer represents a node and there is an edge between two nodes if the hamming distance between these two nodes is at most 2 d and they belong to different sequences The problem of finding motifs is then reduced to finding large cliques in this graph. The problem of finding a maximum clique in a graph is known to be NP-hard. The authors use some novel pruning techniques to find large cliques WINNOWER [7 uses a technique to generate Extendable Cliques. It is an iterative algorithm. The run time of this algorithm is O N 2 d 1  N=nm  SP-STAR uses a technique which eliminates more edges than WINNOWER and hence is faster. It uses  less memory as well PatternBranching 8  performs a local search. It generates the neighbors of all l mers present in the sequences and uses a scoring method to assign scores for these neighbors There are n  m l 1 l mers present in the sequences. Each l mer has 3 d neighbors The scores of all the neighbors of all the l mers are computed and the best scoring neighbors are identified. Since it searches through only a selected set of l mers, it is very efficient. This algorithm takes a u and then computes the best neighbor u 1 of u In the next step it identifies the best neighbor u 2 of u 1 and so on till it computes u d The u d  values for all possible u are computed and then the best u d  value becomes the output. In every step it keeps only one value of the best neighbor but there could be a set of l mers which could be the best neighbors for u  MITRA [6 is based on WINNOWER [7   It uses pair wise similarity information. It uses a mismatch tree data structure and splits the space of patterns into subspaces which start with a given prefix. Pruning is applied to each of these subspaces. MITRA performs very well in practice and is one of the best performing algorithms designed for Planted Motif Search Problem Several algorithms for PMS have been proposed in [1  These are ex act al g o rithms based on radix sorting. The first algorithm proposed was PMS1. PMS1 simply generates neighbors of all the l mers present in a sequence and saves it in an array C i where i is the sequence number. It repeats this for all the sequences. The arrays are then sorted. The lmers we get with the intersection of all C i 222s where 1 i n is the list of motifs. However PMS1 is not capable of solving challenging instances with large values of l Some improvements have also been proposed on 


PMS1 in  Another alg orithm proposed is PMS2 [1 h i s c a p a b le of solving challenging instances up to d 4. For instance, it could not solve the Challenging instance \(15, 5\. The third algorithm proposed in [1 was P M S 3 which was neve r implemented or investigated. In this paper we extend and test the performance of PMS3 Two new algorithms PMSP and PMSi were proposed in which were built upon PMS1  and perform a lot better than PMS1 PMSP [3 uses the idea of exploring the neighbors  of all the l mers that occur in the first sequence and then checking if these represent a motif or not. The worst case time bound of this algorithm is worse than that of PMS1 but in practice it performs much better. It is capable of solving the challenging instance \(17, 6 PMPprune [3 is another algorithm based on PMS1 and is an improvement over PMSP It uses a branch and bound approach. It shows significant improvements in terms of time taken and is also capable of solving the challenging instance \(19, 7\. This is the largest challenging instance that has been solved until this paper Another algorithm MCL-WMR was proposed in and it co nsists of 3 steps. Th e  first step is a graph construction. Each l mer in each input sequence is represented as a vertex and an edge is constructed between two vertices when the hamming distance between the two is less than 2 d and a weight is assigned to the edge. The next step is clique finding using graph clustering. The aim of clustering is to decompose the set of vertices into subsets of highly intraconnected vertices. The final step is to identify the motifs, which is done by identifying cliques of size n that have a weight greater than a calculated threshold This algorithm does not work for the challenging instances like \(17, 6\. It can solve the \(non-challenging\ instance \(18,6\e could see, this algorithm is similar to WINNOWER. The algorithm that we propose in this paper is much faster than MCL-WMR  II  ALGORITHM  PMS3 Algorithm PMS3 was initially proposed in [1 The concept behin d PMS3 is that if M  is a motif of length l we can divide it into two parts M 1 and M 2 where M 1 is the first half of M and M 2 is the second half of M Let S=s 1 s 2 205,s m be an input sequence and let S i  be an occurrence of M in S Let l=2l\222 and let  S\222=s i s i+1 205,s i+l\2221 and S\222\222=s i+l\222 s i+l\222 1 205 s i+l1  Clearly, either the hamming distance between M 1 and S 222 is at most d 222 \(where d 222 d 2\e hamming distance between M 2 and S 222\222 is at most d 222. Algorithm PMS3 is based on this observation                         Algorithm PMS3  Get the set R of all motifs of length l\222 that occur in at least n\222 of the input sequences at a hamming of at most d\222  Here l\222  l 2 n\222  n 2, and d\222  d 2 for i 1 to n do for h 0 to d\222 do  Find all the occurrences of all the motifs of R in Si with a hamming distance of h This can be done as follows: form all the l\222 mers of Si keeping track of the starting position of each in Si  For each l\222 mer u Si and all the l\222 mers v such that u and v are at a hamming distance of h If R\222 is the collection of these l\222 mers, sort R and R\222 and  merge them; and figure out all the occurrences of interest For every position p in Si let L  i, p h be the list of all motifs of R that are in Si with a hamming distance of h starting from position p   


                               In the above algorithm A is the set of candidate motifs. Followed by the computation of A we check if each one of these candidates is a valid answer. Each valid answer is then output. Note that for each candidate we need O mnl time to check if this is a valid answer or not  III  IMPLEMENTATION PMS3 is much simpler than prior algorithms such as PMSP, PMSi, PMSprune etc. Also, PMS3 solves the challenging instance \(21, 8\s not been reported solved before. All the algorithms for planted motif search employ random data as a benchmark. We also use the same data. This data is constructed as follows. There will be 20 sequences of length 600 each. Each of these sequences is randomly generated such that each character in each position is equally likely to be one of the symbols in the alphabet. The motif M is also generated randomly in a similar manner. 20 instances of M are generated from M such that each instance is at a hamming distance of d from M These instances are then planted in the input sequences starting from random positions. There are some challenges in implementing the algorithm. The challenging step is the one where the array  A i is obtained The simple method explained in the algorithm works fine with lower values of l  but does not work for higher ones. So instead of generating the arrays one sequence at a time and then taking the intersection, we pick one l\222 mer at a time from the list R and then check for all the occurrences in all the sequences. Next we generate lists Q 222 and Q 222\222 with the neighbors of prefixes and suffixes respectively and get the smaller list  A i Thus it solves the problem of space required to save the list A i as initially proposed in the algorithm. The algorithm was implemented on Xeon processor with 3GHz frequency and 4GB RAM. The coding was done in C  IV  NEW ALGORITHM Both PMSprune [3 n d PMS3 1  a r e ex  I nste a d of usin g arrays to generate and store the neighbors of l-mers, PMSprune e s a tr ee to stor e the neighbors for each l-mer. It also uses a pruning technique, whic h helps improve the runtime significantly. We use a similar idea to improve the performance of PMS3 A  370  for i 1 to n do  Ai  370  for p 1 to m\226 l\222 1 do for h 0 to d\222 do  Let q\222 be the l\222 mer of Si ending at position p 1 and q\222\222 be the l\222 mer starting from position p  l\222  Generate Q\222 the set of all l\222 mers that are at a hamming distance of d - h from q\222  Also generate Q\222\222 the set of all l\222 mers that are at a hamming distance of d\222 - h from q\222\222  for every u L  i, p, h  do for every v Q\222\222 do Append v to the end of u to form an l mer. Add this l mer to Ai  for every v Q\222 do Append u to the end of v to form an l mer and add this l mer to Ai    If  A is empty and Ai is nonempty  then  A  Ai  else if both A and Ai are nonempty  then A  A Ai     


Before discussing the algorithm, we need to explain a tree T\(u\ployed by PMSprune. It  is cons tructed with u as the root node. The nodes of the tree are the neighbors of u. The tree would be of depth at most d. At a level i, the nodes would be at a distance of i from the root. The distance between any node and its parent is always 1 Pruning is applied to a node v if a certain condition is satisfied. Th e details and a proof for the pruning technique is provided in [3   However, it is briefly explained in this paper D\(v, S\follows d\(v, S i distance of v with each l2-mer in sequence S i  D\(v, S\\( d\(v, S i  i t Now, for any node v in tree T\(u\we decide to prune based on the following conditions If D\(v, S\ 2d-h, no descendants of v would be a motif If D\(v, S\= 2d-h, consider only v\222,where v\222,S If D\(v, S\= 2d-h-1, consider only v\222 where v\222 is a child of v and D\(v\222 S\<=D\(v, S Similar to PMS3, PMS3p  divides the lmer into two parts, of size l 1 and l 2  When l is an even number l 1 and l 2 are equal otherwise l 2 is 1 greater than l 1 We take the first sequence and for each l 2 226mer, u, in that sequence we form a tree T\(u\ree is traversed in the depth first way. For each neighbor v of u, we check if v occurs in all the sequence with a hamming distance less than equal to d or not. Then, we also need to check if we need to prune the descendants of v based on the conditions above. If v is pruned, we go to the next neighbor of u. If v is not pruned, we check for all occurrences of v in the sequences. If v occurs at location p in a sequence s at a hamming distance of h, then we generate  all the neighbors of l 1 226 mer at p l 2 at a hamming distance  of d-h and store it a list Q\222. Similarly, we generate  all the neighbors of l 1 226mer at p l 1 at a hamming distance  of d - h and store it a list Q\222\222.  We merge the list Q\222 and Q\222\222 and store it in A s  where s is the sequence number.  At the end we find the intersection of all A s where 1 s t and output that as motifs                       Algorithm PMS3p  Let l 1  l 2 and l 2  l-l 1  Let d 1  d    For each l 2 mer u in S 1  Construct a tree T\(u The tree is traversed in the depth first way For every neighbor v of u If v has already been covered previously If the tree needs to be pruned for v switch to the next neighbor v Let A = null For \( s= 1 to t A s null For \(i=1 to ml 2 1 Calculate h = dist l 2 mer\(s, i\v  If h <= d Let q 1 be the l1-mers, i l 2  Let q 2 be the l1_mer\(s, il 1  Generate neighbors of q 1 at a distance \(d-h\ save in the list Q1 Generate neighbors of q 2  at a distance \(d-h\ save in the list Q2  For each element x in Q1  Add l 2 mer\(s, i\ to A s   For each element x in Q2  Add l 2 mer\(s, i\ A s   Apply radix sort to A s    If \(A= null A=A s  Else A = A intersection A s   Output the l-mers in A    


V  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PMS3 is a very simple algorithm which does not use complicated data structures. It is capable of solving the challenging instance 21, 8\been solved by any other algorithm yet \(to the best of our knowledge\hows the results of PMS3. The table does not include the result for L less than 17. Although, PMS3 is an efficient algorithm, we had to implement it in such a way so that it is able to work for higher values of L and D. Thus, the algorithm does not perform better than the previous algorithms for the lower values of L L d Time 17 6 20,000 sec 18 6 12,000 sec 19 7 26 hrs 21 8 22 days Table1. Performance results for PMS3 Although, PMSP 3 which are also improvements over PMS1 perform better than PMS3 for \(17, 6\, they are still not able to solve the challenging instance \(21, 8\ MCL-WMR [4 shows g ood  results but it can\222t solve the challenging instance \(17, 6  For challenging instances, the list R generated in PMS3 is of the size nearly equal to 4 l\222 Thus, for such cases we actually check for all possible l\222 mers. This problem is solved in PMS3p by using the pruning technique. For the l 2 mers in Sequence 1, we generate all neighbors with a hamming distance less than or equal to d For challenging instances, this would be of the size 4 l2 The space complexity of this algorithm would be O \(mn\etically the time complexity of PMS3p would be same as PMS3. But, in practice there would be a significant improvement. We can claim this because PMSprune which is an improvement over PMSP, take only 69 minutes to solve 17, 6\ours taken by PMSP PMS3 takes about 5.5 hours to solve the same problem. So, if we implement PMS3p we expect the time taken to be less than an hour. It is noteworthy that MCL-WMR does not work for the challenging instances like 17, 6\It can solve the \(non-challenging instance \(18,6\gorithm proposed in this paper is much faster compared to it VI  CONCLUSION We have extended and implemented PMS3 which was initially proposed in  The algorithm uses a very simple concept Although it takes a little more time than PMSP and PMSprune [3 a p a b le of solving \(21, 8\e of the previous algorithms have been able to solve challenging instances for d 7. For instance our algorithm is better than the algorithm proposed in [4  The algorithm has scope for  improvements and in future we would be working on methods to reduce the time.  The new algorithm PMS3p proposed here has not been implemented yet, but we expect that it would be much faster than PMS3 and will also outperform PMSprune  VII  REFERENCES    S. Rajasekaran, S.

6 CONCLUSION Neptec has developed a vision system for autonomous onorbit rendezvous and docking that does not require the use of cooperative markers on the target spacecraft The system uses an active TriDAR 3D sensor and efficient model based tracking algorithms to provide 6 degree of freedom 6DOF relative pose information in real-time The system takes full advantage of the large amount of geometric information contained in 3D data sets By following the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm where the sensor only acquires the data necessary to obtain the pose of the target real-time performance can be achieve with flight hardware Following the same smart scanning strategy Neptec has developed a novel technique for localizing a known object on-orbit The new technique called Polygonal Aspect Hashing does not require an initial guess of the relative pose and therefore can be used to initialize tracking or recover if tracking is lost Furthermore it only requires a very sparse non organized 3D point cloud thus keeping the data acquisition and pre-processing overhead to a minimum The technique follows logic similar to the process of adding a piece in a jigsaw puzzle First the set of possible positions and orientations of the scan with respect to the model is reduced to the set of poses that have sufficient overlap Once the set of poses is reduced to the most likely candidates a surface fit check is performed to determine the best matching pose The surface fit check measures the amount of overlap between an input scan and the surface of a reference 3D model of the object to find The algorithm developed was tested with both simulated and TriDAR data Results showed excellent performance and demonstrated that the algorithm works well even with very sparse input data sets as well as in the presence of sensor noise and distortions Processing time results obtained showed that real-time performance can be achieved with this technique As would be expected it was shown that the robustness can be increased by testing more polygons at the expense of processing time Another alternative would be to run the algorithm with one polygon over several sequential scans This technique would be well suited for operations where there is relative motion between the sensor and target like in a tumbling satellite scenario or if the processing power is limited In the future Neptec plans to test more objects with representative geometry and materials to further characterize the algorithm performance The effect of object symmetries will also be investigated It was observed that most failures tend to occur where the object is most symmetric Code optimization will also be performed to further improve performance 1 MacLean S Pinkney L Machine Vision in Space Can Aeronaut Space J 39\(2 63-77 1993 2 Howard Richard T Bryan Thomas C DART AVGS flight results Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp.65550L 2007 3 Ruel S English C Anctil M Church P 43DLASSO Real-time pose estimation from 3D data for autonomous satellite servicing Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 4 Ruel S English C Anctil M Daly J Smith C Zhu S Real-time 3D vision solution for on-orbit autonomous rendezvous and docking Proc SPIE Vol 6220 pp.622009 2006 5 Andrew Johnson and Martial Hebert Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3-D scenes IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21\(5 449 May 1999 6 H Wolfson I Rigoutsos Geometric Hashing An Overview IEEE Computational Science  Engineering 4\(4 October 1997 7 English C Zhu X Smith C Ruel S Christie I TriDAR A hybrid sensor for exploiting the complimentary nature of triangulation and LIDAR technologies Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 8 J Obermark G Creamer B Kelm W Wagner C Henshaw SUMO/FREND vision system for autonomous satellite grapple Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp 65550Y 2007 9 Deslauriers A Showalter I Montpool A Taylor R Christie I Shuttle TPS inspection using triangulation scanning technology SPIE 2005 Orlando Florida April 2005 10 Ruel S English C Melo L Berube A Aikman D Deslauriers A Church P and Maheux J Field testing of a 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Orlando Florida April 12-16 2004 11 English C Ruel S Melo L Church P and Maheux J Development of a Practical 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Proceedings on Automatic Target Recognition XIV Orlando Florida April 2004 10 REFERENCES

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
