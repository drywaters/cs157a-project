The aim of this ongoing project is to quantify erosion based on morphology combined with climatological data \(precipitation ically and climatologically very active area. This study is carried out as a consequence of good results in previous works using both: empirical and deterministic approaches by means of remote sensing data. First: the empirical attempt, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation \(RUSLE to operate on various, from catchment to area, scales [1]. This approach delivers a good idea about soil erosion, especially when focusing on the sensitivity of soil loss, but not taking big mass transports, like in landslides or by rivers, into account. Second, there is the river pro?le analysis carried out for various streams individually. This attempt is detachment limited and will not give an accurate idea about what is going on beyond the considered catchment. We want to combine both attempts in one equation to use the strengths of each approach and improve our previous results for a large study area but with comparable ?ne-resolution. This study should make a contribution to the understanding of the correlation between climatic factors, tectonics, soil erosion and river incision. In contrast to former research we want to create a comprehensive model describing all these relationships only on the basis of remote sensing data. Our model is not limited to the presented study area but applicable anywhere where erosion takes place Index Terms  erosion, modeling, river pro?les, RUSLE Pamirs 1. INTRODUCTION Our study area is located between 70o E to 80o E and 35o N to 40o N including the main part of the Pamirs, parts of Pakistan Tajikistan, Kirgistan as well as a part of the Tibetan Plateau The Pamirs and the Himalayas are among a tectonically very active area, where faulting and rock uplift are responsible for a rugged topography and a worldwide unique relief [2]. These Thanks to GeoArc at the TU-Bergacademie Freiberg and to the  Freunde and Fo  rder der TU-Bergakademie Freiberg  for supporting the conference participitation settings are a consequence of the India-Eurasia collision about 50 Myr ago [3]. The investigation area covers 583881 km2 In addition to that the observed area is characterized by an average altitude of 3400 meters above mean sea level Relief re?ects the interplay between tectonics and erosion. The coupling of crustal deformation and erosion results in the kinematics of mountain building. Erosion in?uences tectonic processes by controlling boundary conditions at the Earth  s surface through denudation and deposition. Consequently erosion is very closely related to climate and thus to precipitation, especially in a region where monsoon is active Soil erosion sensitivity could be de?ned as a response of the regional environment to changes of impact factors like precipitation, soil texture, topography, vegetation and cultivation management. The complex interrelationship between all the components \(natural factors and human activities area with its unique geomorphological features and the lack of available long term data sets are an outstanding challenge for the investigation of the Pamir region and the surrounding area. For this purpose we need and apply modern remote sensing methods and optimized models. The entire area has a major in?uence on the environment as well as climate - not only of the Tibet Plateau and the region but also of Asia and even on a global scale 2. METHODS AND DATA The main purpose of this project is to estimate and calcu 


The main purpose of this project is to estimate and calculate incision and the related erosion, based on interactions of the morphology with precipitation in a tectonically and climatologically very active area. Compared to former attempts with GIS [4] and ground based data, this study focuses on an area where hardly any long term precipitation data is available and where precipitation differs a lot due to the relief. The whole study area is strongly in?uenced by monsoon which is highly variable in its time scale starting from seasonal \(monsoon vs. non-monsoon nial and ?nishing in geological variations. The understanding of the spatial structure in precipitation regime shape \(seasonal variability magnitude estimate the amount of incision and related erosion in extreme physical environments where climatological patterns III - 57978-1-4244-3395-7/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE IGARSS 2009 are complex and consequently hardly known. Precipitation displays small-scale variability that requires frequent, closely spaced observations for an adequate representation [5]. To access the precipitation, we depend on a variety of satellites to estimate precipitation on a global basis. Data sets based on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission \(TRMM vide a calibration-based scheme for combining precipitation estimates from multiple satellites at ?ne scales \(0.25ox0.25o 3-hourly  We use this information along with RUSLE and a power law function that describes erosion through river incision equation 1 and compare erosion rates received by applying results from calculations done only by means of remote sensing data. A detachment-limited incision into bedrock is often modeled as a power-law function for the river pro?le evolution [6]. River pro?le evolution can be expressed as dz dt E = K?A?mS?n \(1 where dzdt is the river incision rate. E is the corresponding erosion rate \(relative to a ?xed base level upstream discharge [7], S? is the local channel gradient and K? is a dimensional coef?cient \(so called erodibility the channel bed  s resistance to lowering. The exponents m and n are constants, depending on local parameters like basin hydrology, hydraulic geometry [8] and hence it includes the relation between discharge and channel width [9]. Further more, these constants depend on the sediment ?ux [7]. An example for identifying tectonic activism is presented in ?gure 1. The knickpoints are indicators for uplift and no steady state conditions In addition data sets obtained from theModerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer \(MODIS Shuttle Radar Topography Mission While this incision model is detachment limited, another promising method to asses erosion is the application of empirical models like the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation \(RUSLE [11 1 RUSLE can be written as follows AR = R  K  L  S  C  P, \(2 where AR is the averaged quantity of soil erosion. Factor R is the precipitation erosivity, which can be described as the energy that is applied to a soil type during a rain or storm event. In this study, R is based on data sets from TRMM Parameter K is the soil erodibility factor. The \(usually combined L S control practices factors. The cover management factor C represents the landuse and is derived by calculating and comparing various vegetation indices like EVI Fig. 1.

While performing well for obtaining quantitative and qualitative overviews, namely in all approaches to asses the sensitivity to soil erosion, using RUSLE may result in the problem of veri?cation and \(precise quired data in the high mountain regions of Asia. This issue appears especially when considering the support practices factor \(P represented by the parameter K in RUSLE easy accessible terrain. Due to this, RUSLE may lag in accuracy of the calculations in high mountain regions, far away from ideal erosion plots of ?at farming land in the United States. Besides this, river incision performs well on small catchment  when requiring a fast and precise regional overview Our currently proposed equation, combining our experiences from applying RUSLE and river pro?le analysis individually, can be written as E = Am  K  Sn  R Rmax  C Cmax 3 where E represents the erosion, K the erodibility of the considered underground and S the slope obtained from SRTM DEM served period of time \(3-hourly, daily, monthly equals the maximal erosivity for the considered study area and time period.

A general work?ow can be found in ?gure 2 Fig. 2. Work?ow for the calculations performed in this study 3. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION While factors for relief change include weathering, erosion and mass transfer \(e.g. landslides or ?oods themselves are governed by several complex geological and climatological feedbacks on different spatial and temporal scales. The ef?ciency of the underlying processes, their variability, rates, timescales and interaction can only be validated by innovative research that is focused on determining the thresholds for climatic and tectonic forces. A barely accessible study area of 583881 km2 in this study can only be examined suf?ciently by applying remote sensing methods The results from previous studies using equations derived e.g 


The results from previous studies using equations derived e.g from RUSLE are promising but need comparison, revision and validation \(e.g. ?gure 3 is showing the output based on RUSLE attempts and capable of delivering comparable results \(to generally accepted equations like RUSLE remote sensing data sets. It performs especially well when aiming at quantitative overviews of erosion sensitivity. While having some further potential left, it is a step in the direction of combining river pro?le analysis with RUSLE and other models for larger, hardly accessible areas. Further more it is more than an option when needing a fast, ready-to-use idea of precipitation effects on erosion or in areas where hardly trustful or only very limited ground truth data is available. While our approach is carried out in the Pamir region, through the general character of the chosen factors, the basic idea can be applied anywhere in the world where erosion takes place Fig. 3.

process, including double-?oating-point registers in the case of the PowerPC 450 caches at context switching time, thereby incurring substantial overhead, especially for CPU intensive application. Our approach is to allow only a single computational process to run at a time, to let the Linux kernel pin down TLB entries to cover the Big Memory area on the ?rst access after the computational process has been scheduled in, and to remove them when that process gets scheduled out \(to keep the memory mapping private to the computational process Thus, an application does not suffer TLB misses when it accesses its Big Memory area Physical memory needed for the Big Memory area is reserved at boot time and is thus not available for use by the kernel as a regular, paged memory. It can be used only by a special computational process. This dramatically reduces the complexity of the implementation Unlike the hugetlbfs-based solutions, our approach is fully transparent, requires no code changes to the application works with static executables, and covers all the necessary application segments The Linux kernel automatically prepares the Big Memory area for a computational application. How does the kernel determine which process should use Big Memory? Our solution is to alter the application  s executable ?le; we use the e_flags ?eld in the ELF header, which is reserved for processor-speci?c data. We de?ned a custom ?ag and wrote a tool that toggles it. We refer to the executables with the ag set as Zepto compute binaries, or ZCBs C. ELF Binary Interpreter To load a ZCB into Big Memory, we have modi?ed the Linux kernel ELF binary interpreter, in particular, the load_elf_binary function, which is invoked from the execve system call First, the ELF header is examined to see whether the binary being loaded is a ZCB. If it is, the kernel sets a bit in the personality ?eld in the task structure so that other kernel functions can easily determine that the process is a ZCB by accessing the current variable Then the kernel creates a virtual memory range for Big Memory, using a simple offset mapping. We currently use 256MB pages to cover the application memory; in the future we will improve the granularity of the Big Memory area by using a combination of different page sizes Once the Big Memory mapping is initialized, the kernel temporarily installs the Big Memory TLB entries to copy the contents of both the command-line arguments and the environment variables to the application stack. The kernel also loads the application  s text and data sections to Big Memory instead of using the usual ?le mapping; the Big Memory mapping cannot be used for ?le mappings because it bypasses the Linux page allocator \(see below words, the entire big memory area is populated when the application binary is loaded D. Memory Manager for Big Memory Our kernel reserves one VMA to cover Big Memory, and our internal memory manager takes care of memory chunks 68 within the Big Memory area \(heap, stack, etc of the memory chunks for mmap requests in Big Memory the manager utilizes the kernel  s red-black tree  a structure normally used for managing entire VMAs. The red-black tree is a self-balancing search tree, which can be searched in O\(log n in the tree The ZCB process address space is actually hybrid; it contains both regular paged memory and Big Memory see Figure 3 have any associated PTEs, since the physical addresses of memory in that region are ?xed. The behavior of the mmap system call varies depending on the request type. Anonymous, private requests, as used for large C library malloc 


mous, private requests, as used for large C library malloc calls, go to Big Memory and are tracked by our internal memory manager. On the other hand, ?le-backed mapping requests  used, for example, to support shared libraries  simply go to the regular Linux paged memory manager because Big Memory cannot be used for ?le mappings Figure 3. ZCB Process Address Space E. Page Fault Handler While we did not need to modify the TLB handler to implement Big Memory, we have added a hook to the Linux page fault handler \(see Figure 4 rst checks whether the current task is a ZCB. If it is, the code checks whether the faulting address is within the Big Memory area; if so, it installs the Big Memory TLB entries Essentially, we get a single TLB miss on the ?rst access after the process has been scheduled in; the entries normally remain in place until the process is scheduled out again. With context switches being fairly rare on the compute nodes, the entries are semi-static As shown in Figure 5, our Linux kernel partitions TLB entries in four groups: kernel mapping, paged memory, Big Memory, and device mappings. The last two groups are Figure 4. Big Memory Fault-Handling Flow speci?c to our implementation. Currently, the number of TLB entries required by Big Memory is proportional to the area size; for example, seven entries are needed to cover 1792MB. Three entries are used to cover the kernel memory kernel low memory, to be precise pin down some entries to cover BG/P-speci?c memorymapped I/O devices: the collective network, the torus DMA the lockbox, the Universal Performance Counter, and the Blue Gene Interrupt Controller. The Blue Gene Common Node Services code segment is also pinned Figure 5. TLB Partitioning in the Zepto Kernel F. Other Kernel Modi?cations Introducing a new concept invariably causes issues; the Big Memory implementation is no exception. Big Memory breaks a number of assumptions in Linux memory management. A ZCB process is forked from regular Linux processes; however, it cannot call fork itself, since the fork code apparently depends on the copy-on-write technique The lack of fork may be acceptable when we focus on a 69 high-performance compute node environment; besides, this is still better than the CNK, which does not support fork at all and must be rebooted to start another process Another issue is that the Big Memory mapping is strictly private and cannot be addressed from other processes  context. The Linux kernel function access_process_vm did not work for ZCB processes; this was an important issue because that function is used by the ptrace system call, on which debugging tools like strace and gdb depend Luckily, the problem was relatively easy to ?x; basically, we now temporarily install the Big Memory mapping while the function is running, to allow other processes to access the address space of the ZCB process V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION To evaluate single-node performance, we ran our memory microbenchmarks and an FFTW benchmark. For parallel performance evaluation, we used the NAS Parallel Benchmarks \(NPB  BG/P compute nodes with four different kernels: IBM CNK standard Linux with 4KB pages, Linux with 64KB pages and our enhanced Linux with Big Memory support. We used the GNU compiler toolchain that supports PowerPC 450 instructions to compile the benchmarks. Program binaries are compatible between the kernels, with the exception of NPB. For NPB, we could run only on CNK and Linux with Big Memory because we do not have MPI support for paged memory. Slight differences between CNK and Linux also exist in BG/P communication libraries, but the program 


also exist in BG/P communication libraries, but the program object ?les are the same A. Memory Benchmarks We evaluated the memory performance using two benchmarks: a streaming copy benchmark and the random memory access benchmark from Section III The streaming copy benchmark is simple: it allocates a memory buffer, divides it in two, and copies data from one region to the other using PowerPC 450 parallel load/store instructions. The benchmark reports the theoretical peak memory performance if it is run in a noise-free environment The results for several different buffer sizes can be found in Table III. With a 16KB buffer size, which ?ts well in the L1 cache, all kernels perform equally well, because no TLB misses are caused by the benchmark even under standard Linux with 4KB pages. With larger buffers, such as 4MB \(which ?t in the L3 cache which do not ?t Linux kernel is signi?cantly lower than under CNK. Linux with Big Memory shows a 0.2% loss compared to CNK This is a small performance hit, but it is still larger than expected, given that the noise level has been measured at just 0.03% \(see Section III detailed investigation of this phenomenon, but we suspect that instruction cache thrashing at context switch time caused by the OS tick update might be responsible; the benchmark issues a series of parallel load/store instructions, and the cost of cache thrashing might be higher than for an FPU benchmark Table III STREAMING COPY BENCHMARK \(GB/S 16KB 4MB 256MB CNK 6.74 4.60 3.85 Linux 4KB 6.73 3.85 3.35 Linux 64KB 6.74 4.51 3.82 Linux Big Memory 6.74 4.59 3.84 In Section III, we showed the results of the random memory access benchmark on CNK and on Linux with paged memory; there was a large difference in performance Table IV adds the result for Linux with Big Memory support the gap to CNK is narrowed to 0.04%, or within the system noise level Table IV RANDOM MEMORY ACCESS BENCHMARK MB/s CNK 44.70 Linux 4KB 14.39 Linux 64KB 16.40 Linux Big Memory 44.68 B.

Clearly, standard Linux does not perform well; 64KB pages improve performance by only 9%. On the other hand Linux with Big Memory shows just a 0.08% performance loss compared to the CNK Table V FFT BENCHMARK Elapsed Time \(s CNK 11.25 Linux 4KB 21.43 Linux 64KB 19.61 Linux Big Memory 11.24 C. NAS Parallel Benchmarks So far we have shown that the Big Memory implementation de?nitely improves memory performance of applications on a single node. To evaluate parallel performance we ran the NAS Parallel benchmarks [14] version 3.3 on 


we ran the NAS Parallel benchmarks [14] version 3.3 on both CNK and Linux with Big Memory support. We ran the experiment on 1024 nodes, in SMP mode \(one process per 70 node in Table VI. The performance is close: Linux runs were slower on most benchmarks compared to those using CNK by approx. 0.1% to 0.7%, with the exception of the IS benchmark, where Linux was 0.5% faster Although the table contains only the results using 1024 nodes, we have submitted most NAS Parallel benchmarks with 256, 512, and 1024 nodes to investigate scalability.

LOFAR Online Central Processing We had the opportunity to observe the performance of Big Memory in a real-life application. LOFAR is a radio telescope being built in the Netherlands [15]. In contrast to current radio telescopes that employ custom-built hardware as a correlator, LOFAR uses a Blue Gene/P supercomputer Our previous work discusses the LOFAR central processor in more detail [7], [16 LOFAR stations stream UDP/IP data directly into the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes at a rate of slightly more than 3Gbps These I/O nodes store the data in a main memory ring buffer which is used to absorb network delays or temporary hiccups in the processing pipeline. From here the data is transported to the compute nodes, where the information is correlated Poor main memory performance of the I/O node running the default Linux kernel proved to be one of the major bottlenecks in trying to achieve optimum data throughput Table VII shows a breakdown of the tasks on the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes running the LOFAR online processing application in a fairly standard 16-bit observation mode and a more challenging 4-bit mode. The required CPU resources in processor cores, are shown for the stock IBM I/O node kernel in the 16-bit mode and for a ZeptoOS compute node kernel, modi?ed to run on the I/O nodes, for both the 16bit and 4-bit modes. We see that using the original I/O node kernel would require almost two entire I/O node cores just to handle the ring buffer, and that there are not enough compute resources available to perform all the tasks in real time, even for the less demanding 16-bit mode We used a slightly modi?ed ZeptoOS compute node kernel, including support for the Ethernet device and excluding compute node speci?c devices like the torus network, on the I/O node. We reserved 1536MB of main memory as the Big Memory area and used it for the ring buffer using six 256MB TLB entries. The I/O node application was also adapted to copy 128 UDP/IP packets into the ring buffer at once, instead of one at a time. These two optimizations reduce the resources required to copy data into the ring buffer by more than 600%, about half of which can be attributed to the lack of TLB misses in the Big Memory area The more challenging 4-bit mode signi?cantly increases the potential number of TLB misses. Although limitations in the default kernel make direct comparison impossible smallscale memory benchmarks show a more than 500 reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when 


reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when copying UDP/IP packets one by one Clearly, the access pattern of the LOFAR I/O node application is very susceptible to performance hits caused by TLB misses. With the stock I/O node kernel, the processor was unable to achieve our throughput requirements. Preventing TLB misses for at least part of the application, combined with several other optimizations not discussed here, allowed us to reduce CPU load considerably, increasing I/O node performance to well beyond our original requirements Table VII LOFAR I/O NODE PROCESSING \(#CORES Stock ZeptoOS 16 bit 16 bit 4 bit Receive UDP/IP packets 1.44 1.44 1.22 Copy data to ring buffer 1.80 0.27 0.37 Send ring buffer to CN 1.40 0.52 0.61 Receive data from CN 1.00 0.10 0.35 Send results to storage 0.40 0.32 0.64 Total system load 151% 66.5% 79.7 VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented the implementation of Big Memory support for BG/P Linux  a transparent, ?at memory space for computational processes. Big Memory addresses two major issues encountered when attempting to run highperformance code on the BG/P Linux: poor memory performance caused by TLB misses handled in software, and the dif?culties of writing an ef?cient communication stack caused by the limitations of the BG/P torus  DMA engine Our experiments have shown that benchmarks running under a standard Linux kernel with paged memory can run up to three times slower than under CNK. With Big Memory support, Linux is slower by only 0.03  0.2%. We think that the 0.03% loss is due to the time spent executing the OS tick interrupt handler; with some benchmarks this can grow to 0.2%, presumably because of instruction cache thrashing With further kernel tuning, it should be possible to reduce the noise level to close to zero. Experiments at scale showed a slowdown of well under 1 71 Employing Big Memory on the I/O nodes was instrumental in reducing the I/O node CPU resources required for LOFAR online central processing. A 500  600% performance increase was observed in key parts of the application allowing the I/O nodes to achieve their required throughput Our modi?cations to the Linux kernel are relatively small principally because we focused exclusively on the requirements of computational processes, rather than trying to solve the problem in a generally applicable way, which would have been far more complicated. We maintain two versions of Linux kernel, and we found porting the Big Memory patches between the kernels to be straightforward Contemporary parallel architectures such as Blue Gene/P Cray XT5, and Roadrunner use commodity CPUs such as Intel Xeon, AMD Opteron, or IBM PowerPC, instead of designs dedicated to computational environments. The memory management units in these processors are essentially designed to support a highly multitasking environment. It would be interesting if future designs had hardware support for computational process address space similar to the Big Memory area that we implemented, to allow for a seamless coexistence of high-performance applications and standard Unix processes on the compute nodes Along with the Big Memory implementation, we conceived the idea of a special process that the kernel treats differently from other processes. In the case of Big Memory the kernel creates a different application address space, and we showed that this idea works for compute nodes. We have also experimented with other uses of this feature, such as disabling nonessential interrupts when a computational process gets scheduled in order to reduce the system noise Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking 


Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking and simple applications. We need to make several improvements in the quality of implementation, such as the granularity of the Big Memory area. So far, we have had little experience with running large, real-world applications on the compute nodes using our modi?ed kernel; this area will be explored as part of our future research Acknowledgments: We thank IBM  s Todd Inglett Thomas Musta, Thomas Gooding, George Alma  si, Sameer Kumar, Michael Blocksome, and Robert Wisniewski for their advice on programming the Blue Gene hardware.

interact with strategic and structural properties of a firm Also, as we see growing amounts of regulation and stronger public reactions to how firms conduct their business, compliance issues have received increased attention. Especially from an IT governance perspective, two questions are exciting to ask: How are alignment and compliance related, i.e. to what extent can or should the dimensions of alignment be an explicit part of compliance activities? And one step further: As regulation regarding internal controls like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the USA affects almost all IT activities [61] this is a highly relevant issue. From an IT business value perspective, IT business alignment may be a driver but IT compliance may act as a constraint In practice, combining the demands for compliance and value delivery of IT is widely seen as the domain of IT governance [43]. This leads to the second question: Is there a positive business value impact from compliance beside just being compliant, i.e. do improvements from better governance/alignment structures and actions would have been worth the effort even without external regulatory pressure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 References   1] Alavi, M. and Leidner, D.E., "Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues", MIS Quarterly 25\(1 2] Armstrong, J.S. and Overton, T.S., "Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys", Journal of Marketing Research, 14 3] Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., and Wilson, D., "Using and Validating the Strategic Alignment Model", Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13\(3 4] Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., and Mukhopadhyay, T., "Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation", Information Systems Research, 6\(1 5] Bassellier, G. and Benbasat, I., "Business Competence of Information Technology Professionals: Conceptual Development and Influence on IT-Business Partnerships MIS Quarterly, 28\(4 6] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Gomber, P., Wagner, H.-T and Weitzel, T., "Die Bedeutung des Alignments von IT und Fachressourcen in Finanzprozessen: Eine empirische Untersuchung", Wirtschaftsinformatik, 48\(5 339 7] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of outsourcing on IT business alignment and IT flexibility: a survey in the German banking industry",  Twelfth Americas Conference on Information Systems AMCIS 8] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "Strategy matters - The role of strategy type for IT business value",  12th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS 9] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of operational alignment on IT flexibility Empirical evidence from a survey in the German banking industry",  13th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS CO 10] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The Influence of Alignment on the PostImplementation Success of a Core Banking Information System: An Embedded Case Study",  40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences \(HICSS Big Island \(HI

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
