INTRODUCTION Matlab has big and powerful functions to scientific calculation[1]; it can be used to develop physical experiment data treating system. Nevertheless, the applying software developed must be installed in every computer with Matalab It is very inconvenient. Although the system can be improved by adopting the Client/Server networking structure system, a part of the application software must be installed in the client either. The problem can be overcome by Browser/Server \(B/S developed application software should only be installed in Matlab Web Server[2-4]; it is very convenient and could be used in different platform of operating system. Matlab Web Server as a component of Matlab provided function of Web services was embed in Matlab by MathWorks after version 6.0. The Matlab server can be built, and the application software developed can be installed in it. The operation can only be proceeding in a computer with browser by user. The results, and even the complicated 3D graphs, can be obtained except installing any Matlab program in users computers, the application prospects is extensive[5-9]. In the paper, how to deal with physical experiments data by Matlab Web server under Internet environment was studied, specific practical method was given II. THE SYSTEM STRUCTURE The B/S communication networking sttructure system shown in Fig.1 was adopted in the study. The MATLAB applications that use the capabilities of the World Wide Web to send data to MATLAB for computation and to display the                  


      results in a Web browser were created by using MATLAB Web Server. The MATLAB Web Server depends upon TCP/IP networking for transmission of data between the user and MATLAB. The required networking software must be installed on users system prior to using the MATLAB Web Server. It mainly consists of two parts: the first is Matlab Web Server program matlabserver.exe, which manages the communication between the Web application and MATLAB Matlabserver is a multithreaded TCP/IP server. It runs the MATLAB program \(M-file named mlmfile contained in the HTML document Matlabserver invokes matweb.m, which in turn runs the Mfile. Matlabserver can be configured to listen on any legal TCP/IP port by editing the matlabserver.conf file on Windows system or running webconf on Solaris/Linux. The number of simultaneous MATLABs is specified here. The second one is the service agency, an excusable program metweb.exe which resides on the HTTP server and communicates with matlabserver III. INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE A. Installation the Server Program 1 Matlab Web Server as a component of Matlab can be installed with Matlab, and can be selected to install in server Web Server Matlab Web Server User Internet Figure. 1 The structure of the system 2009 International Forum on Computer Science-Technology and Applications 978-0-7695-3930-0/09 $26.00  2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.307 27034 stand-alone either. Except installing on one computer several machines on Internet can be installed the software to share the calculation responsibilities too 2 Apache which widely used as server software in World Wide Web[10] or IIS can be used as Web Server. The installation is simple B. Configuration Two configuration tasks are needed in conjunction with the MATLAB Web Server programs 1 If the Apache is selected as Web Server, the conf/http.conf file in the main Apache directory should be edit. And the following contents should be taken care of a b c d directory e CGI directory f Options ExecCGI        %The cgi script can be executed   lt;/Directory&gt If IIS is used as Web server, double click the Internet information service to determine the location of the main directory and point out the web page. Under the default web click the right key of mouse, build aliases directory icons and cgi-bin, let cgi-bin have the right to execute CGI 2 When matlabserver starts up, it looks in the file matlabserver.conf for its initial setting data. On Windows 


matlabserver.conf for its initial setting data. On Windows system the installation procedure creates this file in the lt;matlab&gt;/webserver directory while installing the MATLAB Web Server. The contents of it listed in table 1 TABLE I.   THE CONTENT OF MATLABSERVER.CONF FILE m [n]      MATLABs to run. Default is 1 p [n]       Port matlabserver listens on. Default is 8888 o timeout  Number of seconds to wait for matlabserver to start Default   is 300 a path     Path prepended to the MATLAB path at startup No default To connect with matlabserver, matweb requires information stored in the configuration file matweb.conf. It is listed in table 2 The port that matlabserver listens on can be change by mlport command. This value must correspond to the port number set in the matlabserver.conf file or on the command line \(the p argument service agency must be installed in the same computer with the Web server of the system. But for the Matlab Web server, it can be installed in the same or different computers just like shown in table 2 that the M file wulilab1 running on 201.10.16.1 while M file wulilab2 running on 201.10.16.2 TABLE II.

THE RESEARCH EXAMPLE The treating system of physical experiment data has been developed based on Matlab Web Server. Subdirectories cgibin and icons shuld be built under directory yourdemo with file attribute. Files matweb.exe and matweb.conf should be copied to the directory cgi-bin, if any graphics files, copy them to the directory icons A. The process of the system MATLAB Web Server applications are a combination of M-files, Hypertext Markup Language \(HTML graphics. The input HTML documents collect the input data from users and display of output. A MATLAB M-file receives the data entered in the HTML input form, then analyzes the data, generates any requested graphics, and places the output data into a MATLAB structure. At last calls htmlrep to place the output data into an HTML output document B. The design of the real example 1 The file input_template.html provides the code needed to create a MATLAB Web Server input document The input documents can be coded using a text editor or one of the commercially available HTML authoring systems such as Front Page from Microsoft, PageMill from Adobe etc. An abbreviated version looks like lt;html&gt lt;form action="/cgi-bin/matweb.exe" method="POST target="outputwindow" &gt lt;input type="hidden" name="mlmfile value="webfives"&gt  lt;center&gt lt;h3&gt;Measurement of Thermo-Sensitive Resistor&lt;/h3&gt lt;tr&gt Data Record Table&lt;/center&gt 


Data Record Table&lt;/center&gt 27145 T &lt;input type="text" size="5" name="T1 maxlength="5" value=""&gt   R &lt;input type="text" size="5" maxlength="5 name="R1" value=""&gt   lt;p&gt;&lt;/tr&gt  lt;p&gt lt;input type="submit" value="Generate Plot"&gt lt;/p&gt  lt;/form&gt lt;/html&gt The line &lt;form action="/cgi-bin/matweb.exe method="POST"&gt; calls matweb.exe, the entry point to the MATLAB Web Server. matweb.exe is the Microsoft Windows name of the program used by the MATLAB Web Server to extract data from HTML forms. The next line lt;input type="hidden" name="mlmfile" value=" webfives "&gt provides the name of the MATLAB M-file \(mlmfile 2 The M-file template can be used to code the MATLAB application. The template provides the additional code needed to accept input from the HTML input document and to return results to the HTML output document. M file is a function; it includes the main calculation part, the networking function realizing part and the figure generated part. An abbreviated version looks like function rs = webfives\(h mlid = getfield\(h, 'mlid identifier \(to form file name cd\(h.mldir storage of graphic files wscleanup\('ml*fives.jpeg', 1 jpegs older than 1 hour TEMP\(1 h.T1 perspective   RES\(1 h.R1   f = figure\('visible','off graphic plot\(TEMP,RES,'-ko ylabel\('Resistance/\\Omega xlabel\('Temperature/^0C pos = get\(gcf, 'position pos\(3 pos\(4 set\(gcf, 'Position', pos, 'PaperPosition', [.25 .25 8 6 drawnow;                     %Render jpeg and write to file s.GraphFileName = sprintf\('icons/%sfives.jpeg mlid wsprintjpeg\(f, s.GraphFileName s.GraphFileName = sprintf\('/icons/%sfives.jpeg mlid close all templatefile = which\('weblabfive2.html file name rs = htmlrep\(s, templatefile 3 The file output_template.html provides the code needed to create a MATLAB Web Server output document An abbreviated version looks like lt;html&gt lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img border=0 src="$GraphFileName$"&gt;&lt;/p&gt lt;/html&gt The output program realizes the displayment of the results and even the graphics generated by Matlab 


results and even the graphics generated by Matlab 4 Taking the thermo-sensitive resistor lab for an example, the running results was given. While user login the Web server, browser shows the table like fig.2, then user can input the data to the form of the lab, then just put the button "Generate Plot", the result will show like fig.3 V. CONCLUSIONS The user can only use Web browser on Internet to deal with the lab data by using the powerful calculation function of Matlab, especially using its rich graphic functions; the B/S networking structure mode can be utilized to develop several kinds of lab data treating platform. Matlab and the applying software are only installed, updated and developed in Web server instead of in user side computer, it is very convenient safety and has widely applying prospect  Figure. 2 Data input form 27256 ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Educational Commission of Liaoning Province, China Grant No.2008039 Dalian University \(Grant No.E1 REFERENCES 1] Z.

 This goal is further refined in multiple steps that are not shown here due to space limitation The third step in building the security goal graph is to resolve obstacles. We show the resolution of the obstacle to the goal RevelationIntegrity as follows: a way to operationalize the RevelationIntegrity goal is to have digital signatures. Each revelation has a signature that depends on the revelation text and the author s identity     After building the goal graph, leaf goals are assigned to agents responsible for achieving these goals through means of operations. KAOS operations are used to operationalize \(i.e. fulfill\irements Operations constrain the space of solutions that could be used by solution providers to design the system that shall meet the requirements. The step of goal Operationalization bridges the gap between the problem description space \(requirements\d the solution space \(design T h e f o llo w i ng operation s  have been obtained during goal operationalization Operation SignRevelation and VerifyRevelation operationalize RevelationIntegrity goals.

inside B using the B refinement mechanism to derive design specifications and generate implementation The rational for transforming KAOS operations to B while not transforming the rest of the goal graph is that operations sums up all the behaviors that agents need to have to fulfill their requirements, which are the leaf goals in the goal graph. The mechanism of constructing the goal graph shows that high level goals are refined using AND/OR refinement steps until leaf goals are derived meaning that the fulfillment of leaf goals implies the fulfillment of the higher level goals in the goal graph. Therefore, it is safe to only transform KAOS operations used to express behaviors of agents that perform them to fulfill the leaf goals in the goal graph without compromising the completeness and consistency properties of the requirements model  4.3 Transforming Security Requirements to B  The initial B machine obtained from transforming the requirements model obtained in section 3.2 to B includes an abstract representation of each KAOS operation as a B operation. KAOS operations preconditions are mapped to preconditions of their corresponding B operations. Machine invariants in B are constructed from the invariants of the KAOS objects manipulated by KAOS goals. For further details on the transformation scheme, refe e  have employed the B-Toolkit, which is one of the two most famous commercial tools for B development as a tool to develop our B model and refine it to derive design specifications and implementation. We highlight the significant parts of the B machine as follows MACHINE SpyNetwork \(maxSpies The SpyNetwork machine has a set representing all the spies in the network. The machine invariant defines the types of the machine variables that represent the state of the machine. The machine variables include the set of spies as well as their security attributes such as their mailbox passwords, their public and private keys  The KAOS operations are mapped to the following B operations. We use the signRevelation and accessMailbox operations as examples of KAOS operations that are transformed to their B equivalents and refine them in B due to space limitation     4.4 Derivation of Design and Implementation  The abstract machine obtained from transforming the KAOS operations to B is then refined to formally derive design specifications and implementation of the SNS security requirements. Each B refinement step prior to the implementation refinement reflects some design decision\(s\ the refining B machine to the refined B machine until implementation is obtained. The refinement mechanism in B provides means for documenting design decisions and building forward traceability links from requirements to design This is achieved through building a more detailed model from a more abstract one The first refinement step for the SNS focuses on data refinement through making the design decision of representing the pool of spies as an array of spies and we will show how the signRevelation and accessMailbox operations are refined accordingly as examples. From the traceability perspective, we can see that this data refinement step does not address the realization of a specific security requirement in the system. It rather concentrates on building a concrete data structure representing the internal system state in a form realizable by programming languages while implementation is generated  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


  The second refinement step makes a design decision of employing DSA \(Digital Signature Algorithm\ as the signature algorithm to achieve the revelation integrity requirements. This refinement step provides traceability links between integrity requirements and the design that realizes them. The second refinement step is classified as a procedural refinement since it only removes the non-determinism of the digital signature algorithm being used without modifying the state representation of the refined machine. The second refinement step is not described in detail due to space limitation The next step is to refine SpyNetworkR1 \(the second refinement step\e implementation machine      The final step is to generate C code from the implementation machine. The programming language choice is based on the programming languages available in the B tool being used. Almost all the commercial B tools generate code in C and very few of them generate ADA. The security properties should be maintained by the design decisions and the semantics of the B machines rather than by specific security construct in the programming language to which the implementation machine is translated  5. Security Specification Changes  With the introduction of security changes to software systems, more vulnerability might be added to the system as a result of the maintenance activities Current security engineering approaches might not either consider maintenance activities or provide sufficient information to perform accurate impact analysis resulting in introducing security vulnerabilities. In this section, we demonstrate the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


capability of FADES to structurally handle changes of security specifications by providing sufficient traceability information allowing for more complete and accurate impact analysis of change. According to  e u s e o f a s o f t w a re m odel th at s t ores des i gn decisions and traceability links significantly improve the accuracy and completeness of impact analysis Maintenance activities are classified into four categories according e \(ch a ng es i n t h e  software environment\ective \(new user requirements\e \(fixing errors\d preventive \(prevent future problems\ave chosen an example of a corrective change since corrective changes consume 21% of change requests h e other three categories of maintenance activities will be part of our future work A defective scenario threatening revelation confidentiality is as follows: A spy leaves his team and gets reallocated to another team after a message has been sent. This scenario is not handled by the current encryption/decryption solution used to protect the confidentiality of revelations since the leaving spy would receive a revelation that he is no longer eligible to receive. To correct this defect, the KAOS framework provides a conflict construct that allows the expression of situations that contradict with system requirements. We introduce the following conflict to the RevelationConfidentiality goal   This conflict could be resolved using one of the patterns for conflict resolution y i n trodu ci n g a  new goal to anticipate the conflict   This goal could be assigned to a reliable agent such as the big boss. Analyzing the impact of introducing the new goal shows that the RevelationConfidentiality requirement would be affected by this change. The traceability information provided by the hierarchical structure of the goal graph and the KAOS refinement mechanism direct the change impact analysis to revisit the AND refinement of the RevelationConfidentiality goal. The new goal needs to be added as a subgoal to the refinement of the RevelationConfidentiality goal The goal graph for the RevelationConfidentiality goal would be modified as in Figure 4 \(notice the dark gray subgoal that has been added to the refinement of the RevelationConfidentiality goal  Figure 4:  Accommodating the New Goal Since the new goal is a leaf goal, it will be operationalized using the following operation Operation NotifyRelayWithReallocation Input  Spy{arg relay}, Spy{arg leavingSpy DomPre   relay leavingSpy DomPost  relay, leavingSpy:Spy\ Notified\(relay leavingSpy ReqPreFor  team1, team2:Team\mber\(relay team1\mber\(leavingSpy, team1  Member\(leavingSpy, team2 This operation needs to be transformed to B in order to propagate this corrective change to the derived design and implementation. According to the change impact analysis performed with respect to the transformation of the new operation to B, we discovered that the state representation \(Variables the SpyNetwork machine needs to be complemented with the following variables: team, relaySpies authorizedReceiversFrom, authorizedSendersTo. These variables represent the set of assigned relays of all teams as well as the set of spies authorized to send to or receive from relays. Constraints on these variables need to be added to the invariant of the machine as follows   The definition of the operation notifyRelayWithReallocation is given below while its refinement is not shown here due to space limitation Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


  6. Conclusion and Future Work  This paper presented the FADES approach using the SNS case study. This research addressed a case study that represents a sample of the category of communication systems using the FADES approach This category of systems share a common set of security requirements that have been elaborated in the paper. This assists in verifying the applicability of FADES to communication systems that exhibit high security demands. We have also illustrated how the underlying formality allows for documenting design decisions and trace these decisions to their corresponding security requirements While this paper demonstrated the conceptual framework of FADES, a number of future research steps are ongoing. We have embarked on case studies from other categories of software systems for further refinement and to show its applications. Further FADES is being quantitatively compared to other relevant approaches that derive design from requirements. The comparison will involve the application of both FADES and the other comparable approaches to the same case studies to measure the strength and limitations of FADES as opposed to other relevant approaches Future work might involve the demonstration of the capability of FADES to structurally handle other categories of maintenance activities \(perfective adaptive and preventive  Acknowledgement  This work was supported in part by Science Foundation Ireland grant 03/CE2/I303_1 to Lero-the Irish Software Engineering Research Center www.lero.ie Thanks to Dr. Van Lamsweerde who granted us a free license of the Objectiver software that has facilitated our work in the elicitation and modeling of security requirements using the KAOS framework  References  1  A. van Lamsweerde Elaborating Security Requirements by Construction of Intentional AntiModels  Proc.

EIS System Network View Meta-model operations are those used for service description and must be ultimately decomposed into elementary ones \(i.e. data processing, storing and transferring are estimated through parameter values that are propagated by service invocation parameters to parameters describing application operations constituting the service description which are further propagated to parameters describing elementary operations 4.3. EIS Architecture Design Task Implementation EIS Architecture Design tasks may be supported by existing tools [20]. Systems Modeling Language \(SysML 15] is considered as the most appropriate for EIS System Network model representation and requirement engineering, since it supports the concepts of requirements and resource allocation. As a direct consequence, SysML allows the representation of requirements as model elements which means that requirements are part of the system architecture. For representation purposes, a SysML pro?le for EIS System Network meta-model \(?gure 6 mented as a plugin to MagicDraw modeling tool [2]. In order to facilitate model exchangeability, EIS System Network model is being realized in XML, which is a standard exchangeable format. In order to exchange data with speci?c software tools, model transformations will be accomplished through appropriate XSLTs developed for each tool for example as the one transforming XMI to the EIS System Network document type description \(DTD 5. Case Study In the following we discuss the case of renovating a legacy information system supporting a large-scale public organization based on the proposed concepts. The organization supports more than 350 interconnected regional of?ces and its main purpose is to provide services to the public both citizens and businesses. Regional of?ces are divided into three categories according to their size and information infrastructure requirements \(large, medium and small More than 15.000 employees work in the organization having on-line access to the legacy system. There are more than 300 different services provided to the public, while each citizen is required to register in the one belonging to his/her residential area, called residential of?ce. Some of them require the actual presence of citizens in their residential of?ce Existing system architecture is based on a fat clientserver architecture. All application logic is programmed within the client platform, while data is distributed in local database servers located in each regional of?ce. A Central database is supported in the Datacenter for data synchronization and lookup purposes. The Datacenter and all regional of?ces participate in a private TCP/IP network to facilitate ef?cient data replication. Most data related to a speci?c citizen are maintained as local data in his/her residential of?ce. Client programs access the local database to store data, while they access the central database mostly for lookup purposes. Local data are asynchronously replicated in the central database using a transaction management system \(TMS Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 to facilitate communication with the central database. The central database provides the overall view of each citizen  s record 


record To enhance the level of services provided by the organization, we decided to establish an enhanced e-services environment through an e-government portal. The main target of the portal is to minimize the need for citizen  s presence in regional of?ces and intents to deal with all the drawbacks of the current e-service platform. It provides easy access to citizens and businesses twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. It also promotes the increase of e-services to users, facilitating the organization to accomplish its strategic goals. The portal facilitates on-line transactional services and ensures on-line access to the databases of the legacy information system Provision of transactional e-services re?ects the operation of the legacy system and thus results in its renovation. In order to effectively support both systems \(e.g the portal and the legacy system able to apply the same policies and minimize maintenance cost. Thus, it was decided to explore the renovation of the legacy information system by adopting modern technological trends, such as multi-tiered application architecture server-based computing and light clients. It was decided also to rewrite application code based on J2EE architecture to develop a web interface for the legacy information system in order to support a uni?ed environment for both the legacy system and the portal. This decision affected the legacy system architecture, described in System Network View. Some of issues raised included: \(a database architecture? It is currently distributed. Should it become centralized? What are the implications in the network infrastructure? \(b complished to minimize maintenance cost Though EA was never fully described, the organization had already decided to establish an EA based on Zachman framework a few years ago. RUPmethodology was used for software development, thus application description models were developed within Rational Rose platform. In order to be able to apply the proposed tasks identi?ed in section 4, relative information had to be extracted from the corresponding cells. Application description \(e.g. applications and modules tracted from corresponding Rational Rose ?les. Though the process was not automated, the provision of System Network meta-model, helped architecture designer to identify the information needed to obtain from software designers Detailed service description in terms of load requirements could not be extracted from software description. This was crucial in order to decide upon Intranet and Datacenter architecture. This information was collected by interviewing software developers The new system has to deal with a number of require&lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Small Regional Office oracle L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt tuxido L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt L.R.O. department tuxido Central

Topology View - Existing System ments, with security and availability being the most important ones. Security issues have to do with the security of the network, security of data, authentication control, etc. Availability requirements deal with the backup subsystem, the recovery system and high availability UPS. Privacy must be enforced with the use of cryptography and compression techniques. All these requirements were identi?ed during the System Architecture design process and consequently exported in System Motivation cell where all system requirements are gathered using a simpli?ed text-based requirement description method System Architecture design tasks were performed by existing tools already described in [20]. The existence of System Network meta-model and its implementation in XML facilitated tool integration and interoperability. The identi?cation of primary EIS engineering activities served by Zachman matrix rows and columns facilitated a better understanding between software developers, architecture designers and organization management and enhanced discrete methodology integration. Existing and renovated application architecture of the legacy system de?ned by Topology View are presented in ?gures 7 and 8 respectively. The screenshots are from the MagicDraw [2] tool, enhanced with EIS pro?le to provide the appropriate functionality 6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work MB-EISE process based on Zachman framework was explored in the paper. The designer may adjust basic MB-EISE activity model for each cell, formulate a methodology-independent EIS cell-related view, and ?nally identify methods and tools appropriate for implementing each speci?c task. One could argue that in such a case, 36 distinct EIS sub-views should be de?ned, each of them being rather complex, while basic MB-EISE activity should be adjusted 36 times, resulting in a very complicated process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Application Server lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt

Topology View - Renovated System However, EIS engineering process, as enterprise architecture, is itself complex. The bene?t of the proposed approach is that all aspects \(simple or complex form and modular fashion. Cell-related sub-views and corresponding meta-models, as well as cell-related MB-EISE activity model may be progressively formed according to the designer  s priorities and perspectives Having a black-box view of each Zachman cell, the proposed approach focuses on EIS view integration and interview consistency. The notion of external entities when de?ning EIS cell-related views provides the means for interoperability with external cells, while at the same time facilitates atomicity within the limits of each cell. We are currently emphasizing Business and System rows, and especially Function and Network cells, exploring in parallel Motivation column and the way non-functional requirements are managed Having a white-box view of each Zachman cell, it is evident that the de?nition of a technology neutral metamodel and the identi?cation of basic engineering tasks, corresponding to EIS cell-related views, contributes to the integration of different methodologies and tools. A library of EIS System Network models has been already implemented in XML.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
