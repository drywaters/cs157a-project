The e-GIFs normally set out the policies, standards, guidelines and technical structure. Our literature review shows that the failure that governments face regarding e-GIFs includes lack of experience in their implementation. In fact, only following the suggested open standards, policies and contexts guideline in e-GIFs may be insufficient. The successful e-GIF adoption needs more practical implementation support. This paper proposes a practical approach to electronic government interoperability. The approach considers the adoption of Interoperability Practical Implementation Support IPIS evaluate the results. A comparison between approaches with and without the IPIS tool illustrates significant differences. The case in this paper is a Thailand e-GIF pilot project to build a common XML schema standard for data exchange   1. Introduction  Since 2000, e-Government Interoperability Framework \(e-GIF recent ICT investments have reinforced the old barriers that made government decision-making, not to mention citizen access to public services, difficult [8]. EGovernment interoperability can be achieved through the adoption of standards or through architecture to each other and to the environment, and the principles guiding, its design and activity [9].  In many countries the e-GIFs are defined as a set of standards and guidelines that set out a common language to govern exchange of information between ICT systems. The governments have adopted the e-GIFs for their interoperable systems. However, the challenges that governments face regarding e-GIF include: 1 bureaucratic challenges due to the nature of bureaucracy and the lack of accountability of different agencies; 2 adopted standards; 3 using the right metrics to measure the success of the eGIF [8, 9].  In fact, the bigger and more complex the bureaucracy, the more difficult it is to implement an eGIF Many governmental departments have entrenched cultures which avoid openness and cooperation with others. This makes the e-GIF adoption become more difficult. Moreover, in   complying with e-GIFs, there is no guarantee that other agencies will truly follow. It would be more cautious for governments to adopt an incentives-based approach to e-GIFs compliance [18 The e-GIFs implementation based solely on voluntary compliance is not a viable solution. Governments might have to develop mechanisms to enforce extensive use of the e-GIFs.  A successful e-GIF 


extensive use of the e-GIFs.  A successful e-GIF should respond to realities that specific governments face. The particular conditions of each country are also a considered factor of the successful e-GIF adoption Nowadays, many e-GIFs still focused on contents based guidelines, suggestions and contexts. In fact merely following the suggested open standards policies and contexts guideline is inadequate. Thus governments have still been facing non e-GIF compliant projects and some failures regarding e-GIF One failure includes inexperience with e-GIF implementation. The successful e-GIF adoption needs more practical implementation supports and successful experiences and skills. The literature reveals surprisingly little work on practical e-GIF developments guidelines, which could prevent failure This paper presents a practical approach for e-GIF. The approach considers adding the Interoperability Practical Implementation Support \(IPIS approach. The IPIS is a set or an integration of the support tools. It assists implementing interoperable projects through e-GIF approach. In this paper, we Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE developed the IPIS tool to support a Thailand e-GIF pilot project. The project aimed to build common XML schema standards for interoperability in data exchange We then evaluate the results of using the IPIS tool and compare them with a project that did not use the tool The results show that the successful e-GIF adoption needs a practical support application in addition to standards and guidelines The paper is organized as follows: First, an introduction of conceptual background, interoperability layers, and e-GIF concepts. Then, the basic concepts of IPIS, conceptual model, architecture and application are presented. The evaluation and comparison results are described. Finally, the conclusions are presented  2. Conceptual background  Interoperability is the ability of a system or process to use information and/or functionality of another system or process by adhering to common standards 3]. Interoperability architecture is made up of a range of complementary technical specifications, systems standards, guidelines and polices [22]. Regarding the concept of interoperability architecture, most e-GIFs have been designed to fall under the three dimensions of interoperability as follows   Organizational interoperability is concerned with the coordination and alignment of business processes and information architectures  Information or semantic interoperability is concerned with ensuring that the precise meaning of exchanged information is understandable by an application receiving the data  Technical interoperability is concerned with the technicalities of connecting computer systems for the purpose of exchanging information or using functionality  Based on these dimensions, e-GIFs adopted several standards to ensure interoperability across governments 14].  A standard is an agreement among independent parties about how to deal with some tasks. The standards help to define component interfaces technical techniques, and data. The main thrust nowadays is to adopt open and international standards for all government systems and to adopt XML and 


for all government systems and to adopt XML and XSL as the core standards for data integration and the presentation data [4, 12]. This leads to increased interoperability, and to simpler, repeatable and quicker integration efforts [13]. Some e-GIFs focus on improving standards for business services. These standards are meant to support data exchange particularly in business areas like e-learning, e-health etc. Another extension to the layers is categories of standards for web-based services. These standards connect and integrate web-based applications over the internet [18, 20]. In addition to achieving interoperability through the standards, architectures have a crucial role in ensuring e-government interoperability success. The standards and architectures are two related approaches to interoperability.  In Germany, governments developed an interoperable approach by including architecture and standards in one document called  Germany  s Standards and Architecture for e-Government Applications \(SAGA  11].  In a European Union context, they are also endeavoring to adopt e-GIF including the standards and architectures, to develop pan-European services [10 However, in practice, architecture design is not a static concept. It will change and grow as administrations develop interoperable services, as technologies evolve, and as administrations change Implementing all of the principles of an interoperable architecture will take time and may require tailoring of the possible solutions.  Even the standards, their selection and categorization will differ from place to place.  For example, the EU and German frameworks grouped standards according to services \(i.e. job search, income tax, enrolment in university, etc used these to address the three dimensions of interoperability [10,11]. Unlike e-GIFs in Australia [1 Brazil [2], Denmark [6], Malaysia [20], New Zealand 16] and the UK [5] approach  interoperability standards by the technical aspects such as interconnection, data integration, metadata presentation, and security [8,9].  These dynamic interoperable concepts make the implementation through e-GIFs become harder and more unachievable especially for e-GIF initiatives. Furthermore, the successful e-GIF implementation will need to address many challenges, including complex bureaucracies and agencies, compliance, enforcement and capacity development [15]. For example, in Thailand, an e-GIF initiative was announced in October 2006 called  TH e-GIF  19]. As an initiative, practically implementing e-Government projects through TH e-GIF has experienced obstacles and failures. To reduce the failures, the successful e-GIF adoption needs more practical implementation support and successful experiences. Our practical approach presented in this paper is one of the interoperability approaches to fill the gap of e-GIFs    3.   IPIS: basic concepts  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 This section proposes a more practical approach for electronic government interoperability. The approach considers the addition of Interoperability Practical Implementation Support \(IPIS former interoperability approach under e-GIF to fill the gap between concepts and practices 


gap between concepts and practices  3.1 Conceptual Model  Figure 1 shows a conceptual model focused on our approach. The model comprises three layers: Noninteroperability, Interoperability practical approach and Interoperability implementation. Non-interoperability among organizations is concerned. On an interoperability practical approach level, a new interoperability practical approach was introduced in order to achieve interoperability among the organizations. The approach emphasized the adoption of IPIS with e-GIF guideline. Based on e-GIF guideline, the use of UN/CEFACT Modeling Methodology \(UMM modeling approach to design the business services that each business partner must provide in order to collaborate [24]. At an information or a semantic interoperability level, UN/CEFACT Recommend 34 25], Core component technical specification \(CCTS 23], and ISO 11179 are frequently guided in e-GIFs to standardizing and harmonizing data, and UN/CEFACT XML naming and design rule [25] is introduced to standardizing/naming XML schemas. At the level of technical interoperability, in e-GIFs the technical standards catalogue will be defined. The catalogue is a set of specifications that conform to the technical policies [7]. It covers the areas such as data exchange interconnection, data integration, presentation and security. In our approach, the addition of IPIS was proposed Fundamentally, the IPIS is a set or an integration of interoperable support tools. Those tools are designed and developed to assist implementation of interoperable e-GIF projects. The tools include a business process modeling tool, a data modeling tool an XML designing and developing tool, a web services developing tool and a technical standards usage support tool   Business process modeling tool: a tool to support in modeling/specifying business  processes of an organization using UMM  Data modeling tool: a tool to support in standardizing/harmonizing data based on UN/CEFACT CCTS and Recommend 34   Figure 1.  A conceptual model   XML designing and developing tool: a tool to assist in designing/generating XML schema standard based on UN/CEFACT XML naming and design rule \(XML NDR  Web service developing tool: a tool to develop web service implementing modules such as SOAP call and service  Technical standards usage support tool: a tool to describe/demonstrate how to implement each technical standard guided in the e-GIF technical standards catalogue Those tools in IPIS can be developed in individual or developed as integration. The tools are defined as IPIS tools At a level of interoperability implementation, a set of reusable business process models, data standardized sets, XML schema standards, e-Services and technical standards are required. Based on the interoperability practical approach using IPIS, it will automatically accomplish some of those required interoperability 


accomplish some of those required interoperability implementing components  3.2 Model Driven Tool Development  In order to develop the IPIS tools, we design a Model Driven Tool Development \(MDTD Model-Driven Architecture \(MDA  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 see the MDTD as a new architectural approach for developing interoperable software tools based on Figure 2. Model driven tool development  interoperability requirements. The MDTD starts with an interoperability requirement independent model IRIM the IPIS tool development. The IRIM is further refined to an Interoperability Requirement Specific Model IRSM modules. In order to structure the IRIMs or IRSMs, we adopt the UMM. We design software modules based on IRSMs and implement/coding them with respect to software technology platform. Figure 3 shows a Model Driven Tool Development in our approach  4. IPIS: Application  In this section, we applied the concept of our approach to a TH e-GIF pilot project. The project                   aimed to build common XML schema standards for interoperability in data exchange among governmental departments. Figure 3 illustrates overall concepts of the project. The project was performed based on TH e-GIF guideline. The figure also shows different models between the approaches with and without IPIS  4.1 Project Concept and Approach  TH e-GIF guideline TH e-GIF sets out technical policies standards and specifications. It also provides a guideline and a procedure to build and manage XML schema standards 19]. The model incorporates UN/CEFACT Recommendation 34, Core Component Technical Specification \(CCTS and Design rules \(XML NDR 34 is to assist governments in simplifying and standardizing. It is an iterative process of capturing defining, analyzing, and reconciling government information requirements, and then mapping this simplified data to international standards [25 Capturing process is to capture individual participating 


agency information requirements through identifying and listing the data elements. Defining process is to record the data element name, definition representation \(format or code to analyze information requirements for each data element. Reconciling process is the final step to consolidate the defined and analyzed data inventory into a data set through the process of reconciliation This involves the agreement to use one data element name with a common definition and \(or coding, and a standard message reconciled with the                     Figure 3. Overall concepts of the project Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 international standards of UN/CEFACT CCTS.  The results of these processes is a common data standardized set from various data models In addition to CCTS, it provides a way to identify and capture and maximize the re-use of business information to support and enhance information interoperability across multiple business situations [23 The key concept of CCTS focuses on two parts: core components \(CC BIE semantically correct and meaningful information exchange package. BIE is a piece of business data or a group of pieces of business data with a unique Business Semantic definition [23]. It is derived from CC. In TH e-GIF, it adopts XML NDR to describe and specify the rules and guidelines when developing XML schemas based on information models developed in accordance with the CCTS. The result builds XML schema standards for interoperability in data exchanges  TH e-GIF without IPIS approach \(Approach 1  As shown in figure 3, in order to build a common data standardized set and XML schema standard, it requires many data owners, data modelers and system analysts. The data owners extensively need to participant in activities based on the four processes in recommendation 34. Several meetings are essential to share, to analyze, to discuss and to reconcile the differences of their data models. It is time-consuming to reach agreement on common standards. Also, the data modelers and system analysts who have high skills and much experience are required  TH e-GIF with IPIS approach \(Approach 2  To diminish the demands on the officers? time and skills, we incorporated the IPIS tool in this project. The 


skills, we incorporated the IPIS tool in this project. The IPIS tool development was partially divided into two phases. The pilot project developed the IPIS tool to automatically support in data standardization, XML schema standardization/development, and web service implementing modules generator. This result will aid in information or semantic interoperability level. In future, we plan to develop the IPIS tool to more automatically assist in performing the four processes in recommendation 34 \(see figure 4  4. 2 Project Tool Development  This section illustrates how we design and develop the IPIS tool in our pilot project. Firstly, we design the tool development architecture following the MDTD described in section 3.2. Figure 4 presents the project tool development architecture based on MDTD. As shown in figure 3, the IPIS tool in this project is developed to support in standardizing data following CCTS and in developing XML schema standard following XML NDR. The tool is also designed to automatically generate web services implementing modules such as SOAP call and service. We design the IRIM as interoperability requirements serving semantic interoperability level. In this project, the IRIM is an integration model of requirements derived from data modeling, XML schema designing and developing and web services developing. In addition to interoperability requirements analysis, the IRIM drives five possible IRSMs. They are IRSM1: core components design IRSM2: core components library, IRSM3: business information entities \(BIEs schema standards and IRSM5: Web Services components                         Figure 4. The project tool development architecture  For the IPIS tool design and implementation, seven software modules \(SMs generated IRSMs. They include: SM1: CC designing Thai English designing, SM4: Code list managing, SM5: BIEs designing, SM6: XML schema generator and SM7 Web services developing. In the CC design module the system allows users to propose their required data model in Thai language. In CC English module, Thai data names are translated to English. In the context 


data names are translated to English. In the context design module users can add their required contexts. In Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 the code list manage module users can add and edit code lists [18]. In the BIE design module users can design the required data model based on selected core components and contexts. In the XML schema generation module users can get a XML schema for a given BIE. In the web services developing module users can obtain various source programs for web service components. The IPIS tool was developed using java technology and was implemented as web based application. Figure 5 shows a model of some software modules according with CC design, BIE design and XML schema generating.  The model is based on UN/CEFACT CCTS and XML NDR   Figure 5. A model of some software modules in the project  4.3 Tool Results  In the project, the IPIS tool automatically generates various kinds of sample programs and scripts. These sample programs and scripts can be used in the interoperability implementation process. They include an XML document manipulation java program, a web service java program, a web service client program using SOAP, an XML digital signature java program an XML encryption/decryption java program, WSDL specification files, database generation SQL scripts for data storage, and java server page program for managing and manipulating data. Government offices can use this prototype application as a pilot software development.  The prototype software allows sending and receiving by using web services technology Figure 6 illustrates a sample XML document which automatically generated based on XML schema. Figure 7 shows the screen shot of a generated sample java program. This generated program is a sample java program for XML document building The tool can be used by various participants in the interoperability development process. It assists in building and managing a core component library or dictionary. It also supports controlling, publishing validating a version control of core component dictionary and XML schema standards. It enables users from different agencies to collaborate and build a set of common core components. This support tool can automatically generate a core component library, and context specific business information entities. It can generate a sample XML document, sample XML generator source programs with DOM API, and sample source programs for building web services with SOAP and SAAJ API. These capabilities help agencies to easily develop a pilot interoperable project. These capabilities facilitate electronic interoperability development in e-Government [18]. In future, we plan to develop the extended IPIS tool to fully support in data capturing, defining, analyzing and reconciling in recommendation 34     Figure 6.  A sample of XML document which automatically generated based on XML schema

IPIS Approach: Evaluation  This section presents the evaluation of our approach. The evaluation model was designed based on the TH e-GIF project purposes. We compare the evaluated results between the TH e-GIF approach with and without IPIS.  It shows the benefits of using IPIS for electronic government interoperability  5.1 Evaluation Methodology  In order to evaluate our approach, we design the evaluation methodology to compare two approaches 1 First of all, we define Evaluation Factors \(EF Evaluation Elements \(EE requirements in the methodology focused on IRSMs proposed in section 4.2. They include IRSM1: core components design, IRSM2: core components library IRSM3: business information entities \(BIEs IRSM4: XML schema standards and IRSM5: web services components.  The EFs are concerned about five factors: EF1: Skill needed, EF2: Experience needed EF3: Time and EF4: Cost. In addition to EFs, we design four EEs for each EF and set a value of evaluation called ?Evaluation Value \(EV of 1, 2, or 3. The estimate of EV of  is defined as follows    and the estimate of  of  is defined as follows    Table 1 shows a list of evaluation elements designed according to IRSMs  5.2 Evaluation Model and Results  We designed an evaluation model to evaluate two approaches. Figure 8 shows an evaluation model between two approaches. In the former project government officers had to design core components and to develop CC library, BIE library and XML schemas under TH e-GIF without IPIS. However, in this project, over 200 officers from more 100 agencies used the IPIS tool to support in the designing and developing. Among the 200 officers, more than half of them have no skills and/or no experiences of guidelines, standards, techniques and policies in TH eGIF, eight days of training was organized to teach the concepts of CCTS and XML NDR.

It can also automatically produce some source programs with DOM API and source programs for building web services with SOAP and SAAJ API These capabilities help agencies to easily develop a pilot interoperable project and thus facilitate electronic interoperability development in e-Government The evaluation methodology was applied in the model to significantly illustrate the differences Focusing on 80 EEs shown in table 1, the EV of each EE was evaluated by evaluators.  To compare the approaches, the estimate of EV with respect to EFs was calculated. Table 2 shows the results of our evaluation model. The results show that the approach using the IPIS tool can assist the pilot interoperability project to achieve objectives more easily and economically. The time spent in the project approximately becomes     shorter \(65 about 53%. One of the main causes of failure in a government interoperability project is lack of experiences and skills [20]. The result also shows that by using the support tool, the officers need less experience and skills to achieve the desired interoperability requirements  6. Conclusions  This paper proposes a practical approach to implementing electronic government interoperability The approach considers applying an Interoperability Practical Implementation Support \(IPIS GIF approach.  Normally, e-GIFs set out the policies standards, guidelines and technical structure. In fact only following the suggested standards, policies and contexts guideline in e-GIFs is insufficient. Our literature review shows that many governments experience obstacles and failures in applying e-GIFs to their interoperability projects. Lack of experience and                Figure 8.

   skills in e-GIF implementation is a significant contributor to these failures. To fill the gap, in this paper, we designed and developed the IPIS tool to support a TH e-GIF project. We then evaluated the results of our approach and compared it with the former e-GIF approach. The results indicate that applying the IPIS tool can assist the interoperability project to achieve the objectives more easily and economically. The time spent in the project also becomes shorter. The result furthermore reveals that the successful project needs less experience and skills by using the IPIS tool. This paper demonstrates that a tool such as IPIS provides much-needed practical approach to successfully implementing the interoperability that is at the heart of e-GIF standards   Skill needed Experience needed Time Cost Approach 1 Approach 2 Diff.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
