INTRODUCTION The coalition emergency response system \(CERS to receive public emergency reporting and emergency call, and provide the citizens with emergency assistance, in combination with various emergency service resources. The CERS offers a strong safeguard for the urban public safety by uniform numbers, uniform command and uniform dispatch The CERS intensively coordinates various police kinds and corresponding units, and thus provides an orderly, quick and efficient reaction to the special, sudden, emergent or important accidents The public emergencies in China occur currently at a high frequency, and take a severe challenge in the long future period. Statistically, the number of casualties reaches over one million and economic loss is around 650 billion RMB accounting for 6% of Chinese GDP, due to the annual natural disasters, and social security accidents. However, the CERS can only be found in a few big cities such as Beijing Shanghai and Nanning. Thus, it is very urgent to establish a national CERS According to the characteristics of medium and small cities in China, the operation mode of CERS suitable for Chinese medium and small cities is provided in this paper and then the principle, framework and function design of CERS for Chinese medium and small cities are analyzed II. OPERATION MODES OF CURRENT CERS IN CHINA There is at present no uniform classification for Chinese CERS. According to the system and relationship between the coalition emergency response center and the original command branches, the operation modes may be divided into four types, namely centralization mode, authorization mode proxy mode and cooperation mode. Their characteristics are listed in Table 1  TABLE 1 Comparison of Four Operation Modes of Chinese CERS Centralizat ion mode Proxy mode Authoriza tion  mode Cooperatio n mode Characteri stic CERS center is organized invested 


invested and managed by government  dealing with emergency by separate branches Government authorizes command to police. Police plays a primary rule in cooperation with other branches Generally CERS consists of one government center several branch centers and remote unit centers Advantage Uniform management system and special branch are helpful for uniform command Little system collision; easily constructed rapidly started The relatively mature emergency system can be built by appropriate investment and reconstruction Clear functions for government and branches multi-layer command network Risk Heavy load for command center without multi-layer command network Single command is not helpful to exert branch activity 


activity It is slow to form a uniform command center when emergency is dealt with in the case of crossbranch cooperation Authorization needs to be complete and concrete It is difficult for information coalition due to the composing by multilayer and multi-type centers Typical city Nanning Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou Yangzhou  There is no basic standard for each city to apply the operation mode. Although the overseas CERS began to be built many years ago, there also exist various modes. The CERS operation mode for each city should be determined by city characteristics according to the principle of high efficiency, low cost and good effect Project supported by Youth Foundation of Hubei municipal Committee of Education \(Grant No:2004Q002 978-1-4244-3894-5/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE 1 III. OPERATION MODE AND FRAMEWORK OF CERS FOR MEDIUM AND SMALL CITIES A. Operation Mode of CERS for Medium and Small Cities Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable The CERS of medium and small cities doesn  t share identical characteristics with that of big cities according to much investigation as shown below 1 example, the daily emergency call number in Beijing or Shanghai, including 119 for fire, 110 for police, 120 for first aid and 122 for traffic etc., may reach over forty thousand However, the daily number in a medium or small city may total to only several hundred, with probably several tens of effective emergency calls 2 The CERS focuses on the common civil cases, criminal cases or some basic calls from citizens 3 4 According to the characteristics of medium and small cities, it is considered that the CERS of medium and small cities can not be built by copy from that of big cities. A new mode is provided in combination with authorization mode and cooperation mode according to the characteristics of medium and small cities. Based on the built physical resource, the police are authorized by the municipal government. Then the police undertake responsibility to combine various command centers and more remote terminals by network and 


centers and more remote terminals by network and communication facilities based on police 110, and then take task in coordination with various branches. The government communicates with various branches by emergency network and finds the emergency treatment information. In addition, all the branches can share the emergency data This mode which combines authorization mode and cooperation mode shows the advantage that it doesn  t need much resource to establish a new CERS due to the full usage of police personnel and information resource. Upgraded from the original police command system, a new CERS is built based on police 110 command system. This new CERS integrates various separate command systems and conducts a quick response based on information sharing and intensive command. Fig.1 shows the framework for the CERS of this mode If the police want to establish a uniform command system they should integrate the existing resource, especially the 110 119 and 122 centers into one command center to deal completely with the emergency. The figure above shows that the police 110 play the key rule. Thus, it is very essential to the realization of this mode that how to build a uniform command center    Figure.1. Framework for CERS in combination with authorization mode and cooperation mode B. CERS Framework and Design for Medium and Small Cities The framework of CERS combined with authorization mode and cooperation mode is shown in Fig.2. The emergency calls of 110, 119 and 122 are accessed by telecommunication bureaus, and then be transmitted into dispatching exchangers of command center by a 2MB digital trunk. Finally the emergency calls are dispatched to dealing desk of each command center after the treatment of dispatching exchangers The 119-emergency information is automatically sent to fire brigades by this CERS. The fire emergency is sent artificially to fire brigades, and then be dealt with by fire brigades \(including the emergency record and treatment feedback emergency, treatment feedback and recording files database of command center. The command center can monitor and insert 119-emergency information at any moment, and dispatch other branches according to actual situation The command center dispatches the police or traffic brigades according to the location and disaster level of emergency call. The command center only takes responsibility to transmit, to record and monitor the emergency calls. In addition the command center may dispatch directly the relative personnel or branches  Figure.2. Structure of CERS combined with authorization mode and cooperation mode 2 Integrated with CTI, GIS, GPS, data security and management information system, etc, the CERS can realize the following functions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 IV. ROUTE CONTROL ARITHMETIC The uniform dealing center to treat various emergency calls is the key because the telephone emergency is the primary daily emergency style. Furthermore, the efficient and orderly processing for emergency calls must depend on the 


orderly processing for emergency calls must depend on the Computer Telephone Integration \(CTI with the hardware and software of computer network and telephone network, the CTI integrates voice service with data service After the emergency call is accessed to emergency center the CERS dispatches every call into the most suitable site by route control arithmetic. The performance of route control arithmetic affects directly the service quality of emergency center. The route control arithmetic can be divided into call queue arithmetic and call allocation arithmetic A. Route Control Arithmetic The call allocation arithmetic of first come first service with weighting adjustment is applied in this system. The priority of emergency call is calculated, and then the queue order is determined by calculated priority. The field of Major and type of int for the key branch is established to denote the branch importance. The administrators set the field values by branch importance. However, here exists a problem during the dispatch that the common call can not receive service according to the rule that the key emergency call gets a priority service, if the emergency calls of key branches come continuously. To avoid this unfavorable condition above, the general consideration for emergency waiting time and priority is taken in priority calculation. The queue priority of emergency calls is determined by the following equation TimetMajorty    21 where Y denotes the queue priority, Major representing the importance of emergency call, Time the waiting time, t1 coefficient of importance and t2 coefficient of waiting time When a new emergency call needs to insert the queue, its priority is firstly calculated by the equation above and then be inserted into the appropriate position by ordinal comparison B. Call Allocation Arithmetic The call allocation arithmetic dispatches the emergency call to the site which receives the least calls and has the longest idle interval from last call to now. The arithmetic flow is shown in Fig.3 While an emergency reporter communicates with the emergency center, the CERS searches automatically for idle sites, and defines a variable for each site. When the CERS finds only one idle site, it accesses the reporter to the site. If the CERS finds more than one idle site, two variables are defined to denote the daily received calls and the idle time respectively  Figure.3. Average allocation algorithm of the longest idle time Firstly the daily received call with the smallest number is chosen. If some sites have identical number, the site with longest idle time is then chosen to access the reporter. If there is no idle site, the reporter is told for waiting by voice prompt Thus here needs a queue. The call queue priority is determined by first come first service and first idle first service. The CERS sets a time trigger to monitor circularly the site queue V. CONCLUSIONS As a tremendous system engineering, the CERS involves every branch and all emergency reporters. The currently used CERS is gradually realized based on the access integrated by three networks. The CERS described in this paper are applied successfully for Hubei police systems such as the police bureau of Yingcheng city, police bureau of Jianli county police bureau of Shayang county, police bureau of Wuxue city and police bureau of Enshi city, etc. Other functions of CERS will be realized gradually in the future REFERENCES  1] Zhang Bocheng, Tan Weixian.

Common Hospital to Kiltham Hospital and its emergency room \(ER ICU inpatient ward. On the Inpatient floor 10 East, the nurses, interns \(1st year residents 4th year residents cycles. One is tied to the length of the patient?s stay in the unit. The other follows the lengths of staff members? daily shifts. These two types of document cycles are empirically derived and characterize distinct but not exclusive communicative practices 4.1 Cycles: the lengths of a patient?s stay Each department across the hospital employs its own sets of document cycles tied to the length of a patient?s stay in the particular unit. In each unit the various occupational groups or teams typically will manage their own document cycles. On 10 East one finds three primary document cycles linked to the length of Anna?s stay in the ward. One is managed by the nurses, the other two by the interns and senior residents respectively. Each cycle can be broken into three phases: admission, care, and discharge.  Figure 1 depicts this process exemplified by the 10 East nurses document cycle 4.1.1 Admission. Anna arrives in 10 East accompanied by a host of documents, some electronic and others paper-based. These include the discharge papers from each of the settings she traveled through from primary care, through Common Hospital Kiltham ER and ICU to 10 East. These documents all summarize Anna?s stay in a particular unit or setting whether Primary Care, ER, ICU or 10 East Document Cycle Length of Patient Stay Request Forms Admission Call Discharge Call Lab Work Request Forms Medical Record Orders Orders Lab Work Lab Work Flow Sheet  Figure 1. Nurse Document Cycle: Lengths of patient Stay in Unit As an orderly wheels Anna down to 10 East from the ICU, three meetings take place involving staff from the two units. The ICU chart nurse goes over the ICU nursing transfer sheet with the 10 East chart nurse. The ICU intern in charge of Anna?s care meets with the 10 East intern, Marc, in the cafeteria. They discuss the ICU discharge papers written by the ICU intern. The ICU senior resident talks on the phone with the 10 East senior resident, Elisabeth, as they both look at the senior residents? online note system containing the ICU senior resident?s recordings on Anna Each of the three 10 East staff members outlines the discharge summaries and conversations in separate documents. The chart nurse starts a ?management plan? dedicated to Anna?s nursing care on 10 East \(see center of black arrow in Figure 1 Karen, one of the registered nurses as Anna?s main nurse. The intern, Marc, logs onto the ?resident note system, an online system known as the resident note 


system, an online system known as the resident note system. Elisabeth, the senior resident, logs into the senior resident note system One can characterize these three systems as evolving documents. The recorded information changes over time and there is no record kept of prior recordings. For instance, the nurses? management plan folder contains a number of preprinted sheets in which the nurses pencil in demographic information, a review of Anna?s family and social history and a list of current medications and activities related to Anna?s current care. If changes occur, the nurse will simply erase an earlier entry and pencil in new information. Likewise Marc and Elisabeth will edit the resident note and senior note as Anna?s care changes with no traces of past entries. These electronic documents do not attempt to summarize Anna?s care trajectory but simply list current pertinent tasks. These are not legal documents nor do they go into the medical record 4.1.2 While at 10 East. The nurses? management plans, interns? resident note and senior residents senior note serve as a document backbone for the duration of Anna?s 11 days stay on the ward. Many other documents ?feed to? and ?feed from? these three documents, as characterized by the outer rim of documents depicted in Figure 1. The nurses, for instance, draw from the physician orders and progress notes summarizing Anna?s medication and care and social service evaluations often when updating the management plans on Anna. The interns may transfer vital signs and other notes from the nurses? flow sheet into their resident note. The senior residents and interns daily update their senior notes and resident notes with data from the labs online test result system or the radiology reports. Reversing the flow, the nurses regularly fill out forms for social service requests psychiatric service, home care requests, and security officer requests based on the information kept in the management plan. Interns and senior residents write Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 their progress notes, sub-specialty referrals, and pharmacy prescriptions based on the resident and senior note respectively 4.1.3 Discharge. In the last few days before Anna finally goes home Karen, Marc and Elisabeth start working on her discharge papers. Marc is responsible for writing the discharge summary which is the official summary of Anna?s stay on 10 East. He bases this document on the resident note as well as prior discharge summaries from Common Hospital, the ER and ICU. Elisabeth has to sign off on Marc?s discharge summary and draws on the senior notes as a basis for evaluating Marc?s summary. Karen writes discharge instructions to Anna?s parents with support from the nurses? management plan and Marc?s discharge summary. These discharge papers resemble in structure and narrative format the discharge papers that Anna arrived with at 10 East. In short, one document cycle has been completed 4. 2 Cycles following the lengths of shifts Within the first document cycles we find a second type of document cycle following the length of doctors? and nurses? shifts. As illustrated in Figure 2 the nurses? 12 hour shift cycle starts and ends with a nurse report meeting bringing together the outgoing and incoming nurses. The management plans and piles of small pink and baby blue notes cards, known as brain notes? fill the conference table. The tired night nurses sit with each of their piles of management plans and one by one go over the patients they have cared for overnight. The nurses briefly discuss each patient and 


overnight. The nurses briefly discuss each patient and Karen will fill out a pink note card on each of her female patients and a baby blue one for the boys. On Anna?s pink note card she records Anna?s name, age record number, room number, weights, and ?bronch obstructions, 02, nebs Q2, No surgery consult today social: mother today. This translates to: Anna?s breathing is labored. She should be kept on oxygen O2 The surgery consulting team was supposed to check if she needed to have her airways corrected but they canceled today. Anna?s mother will be in today, which offers Karen an opportunity to talk with her about Anna?s progress and when she is likely to go home. At the end of the meeting Karen and the rest of the day nurses slip small piles of notes cards into their uniform breast pockets and collect the management plans spread over the conference room table The rest of the day Karen uses the note cards to structure her work. When asked if she wants to join a small group of nurses for lunch she fetches her note cards and flips through them. ?Give me 20 minutes, I just have to give the small bronch girl \(Anna nebulizer treatment.? As the day progresses Karen updates her note cards. For instance, she notes the surgery consultant?s new appointment and the frustration Anna?s mother expressed about Anna?s long hospitalization. Karen also uses the note cards when filling out her flowsheets and other documents or to record Anna?s latest test results, changes in her medication and treatment plans Document Cycle Length of Shift Nurse Report Meeting Lab Work Progress Notes Orders Request Form Request Forms Social Work Orders Lab Work Flow Sheet  Figure 2. Nurse Document Cycle: Lengths of Shift In the late afternoon Karen gathers her patients management plans and updates them based on her note cards. There might be changes in medication, new procedures scheduled, test results, or treatment regiments. Just before 7PM, the night nurses start showing up and they gather in the nursing conference room with a clean pile of pink and blue note cards and newly updated managements plans. Karen drops her brain notes in a trash bin ? heading home The interns and senior residents enact comparable document cycles entrained to their respective shift schedules. Marc and the other interns generate a fresh set of brain notes by printing individual patient entries from the resident note system. Elisabeth and the other senior residents organize their senior notes and private brain notes the same way. Thus, the management plan the online resident notes, and senior notes get updated twice a day 4. 3 Oscillation: Broader &amp; Narrower Framing 


4. 3 Oscillation: Broader &amp; Narrower Framing Within each of the document cycles performed by Karen, Marc, Elisabeth and their colleagues on 10 East we find an oscillation between documents targeting broader and narrower configurations of participants times, places and content. Each of these four elements will be discussed in turn 4.3.1 Participants. Each document targets a particular audience and demarcates a group of participants in Anna?s and the other patients? care. As Karen, the nurse, creates her note cards based on the management plans, she moves from a communal Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 audience consisting of all the nurses in 10 East to an audience of one ? herself. Toward the end of her shift she reverses the movement by updating the communal document based on her private notes. Likewise, we find a shift in the participants demarcated by each document genre. As seen in Figure 3, the management plan outlines not only the primary nursing team involved in Anna?s care, but also the physicians primary care providers, community agencies, and consultants involved in the care, as well as important phone numbers of relevant family members or legal guardians. Karen?s private note cards, in contrast denote only the people relevant for Karen?s work that day. As illustrated in Figure 4, Karen includes Anna?s name and a reference to her mother and the surgery consult. Similarly, Marc alternates between the private brain note and the resident note system used by the four interns currently working on 10 East. When Marc moves from the communal resident note system to the discharge summary he further broadens the audience and participants targeted by the document. The discharge summary encompasses a larger and relatively undefined audience, including primary care doctors, nurses, secretaries, possible clinical researchers, and future care givers, in the case that Anna should ever be hospitalized again 4.3.2 Time &amp; Place. The temporal and spatial references change as we move through each document cycle. Karen?s note cards outline a relatively narrow temporal and spatial field for her activities within her 12-hour shift ? guiding her unfolding practices: ?is it time to go for lunch yet?? ?Do I have time to take one more patient before I meet with Anna?s mother Should I give Anna her nebulizer treatment while I care for Beatrice in the adjacent room?? When she updates the management plan she positions these in a significantly broader spatio-temporal field. The management plan includes references to not only current activities, such as medication but also activities pointing to the past and future, as in the case of a concise medical history, tests, discharge procedures and training, or outpatient care arrangements \(see Figure 3 temporal and spatial references as he uses his brain notes to update his resident note or when he writes Anna?s discharge summary based on the resident note Marc?s brain notes demarcate a temporal and spatial field for his work during a shift. The resident note system encompasses Anna?s stay on 10 East and her discharge summary narrates her care trajectory including care at 10 East and possibly recommended follow up care 4.3.3 Content. As the doctors and nurses write and rewrite documents to address different participants times and places they also oscillates between the type of content, i.e., facts, terminology, level of detail, and contextual clues appropriate for each audience. As Karen fills out her note cards during nurse report she 


crafts documents focusing on her immediate work practices and with minimal contextual clues. Karen?s note card on Anna \(see Figure 4 basic information Karen?s needs to administer Anna?s care. For instance, the card lists Anna?s record number and weight ? all central when Karen fills out a new flow sheet or check if Anna?s medication dose is appropriate. The rest of the note card constitutes a simple itinerary of activities Figure 3. Nurse?s management plan Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 Karen does not need to specify these activities in any more detail. With seven year tenure on the ward she knows the nurses? work rhythm by heart. There is no need to specify Anna?s medical history, nor the times she requires oxygen or nebulizer treatments Karen relies on a non-verbal understanding and simply uses her notes as a scaffold to support her unfolding practices. The doctors use their brain notes in a similar fashion. Referring to his brain notes an ER intern explains No one else is going to understand what this means. This is very specific to what I do. Most people just jot notes to themselves -- you know: '5 year old, nasal foreign body, 10 days out of 21 days thick discharge, yellow green, treat with XYZ contact primary.' There is no time line in it; there is no thought process. I know what this means because I am here. But no one else will be able to make sense of it Anna Hauge #846 R8 2 Mos 5.6 kg Bronch obstructions O2 nebs Q2 No surgery consult today Social: mother today  Figure 4. Karen?s brain notes As indicated by the intern these private notes only work for their author. By the end of a shift the intern will update the resident note and add clues which will orient his fellow interns. Still these remain rather vague and rely heavily on the interns shared knowledge of the patients and the rhythm of work on the ward. In Karen?s case, she adds context clues as she edits the management plan. To motivate changes to Anna?s diet or personal needs she may add to the concise history? field of the management plan. She will only add changes that she deems important to her close community of nurses at 10 East. She writes when the surgery team meeting is scheduled, but she will only summarize her meeting with Anna?s mother if information relevant to the nurses? comes to light Towards the end of Anna?s hospitalization the same process takes place. The resident note system largely consists of a list of patient identifiers and activities. In the process of writing Anna?s discharge summary Marc strips away these local coordination tools and adds contextual information by positioning Anna?s care on 10 East as the culmination of a narrative starting with her past medical, family history, and diagnosis upon arrival in the hospital The rest of the discharge summary reviews what is considered relevant organ groups for Anna?s case or rather relevant sub-specialties involved in her care while at 10 East. In the process of writing the discharge summary Marc adds genre clues broadly accepted in the medical community, involving formatting, and terminology. Senior residents and attending doctors often scold interns for using acronyms and lingo specific to Kiltham Hospital in 


acronyms and lingo specific to Kiltham Hospital in their discharge summaries. Marc is literally making Anna?s history public and portable by turning the resident note list into a narrative with full sentences and specification of authorship. The document cycle is completed Documents oscillate between broader &amp narrower explication Participants Times Places Content Format Background knowledge Explicit Documents Br oa de r N ar ro we r N ar ro we r Br oa de r  Figure 5. Document cycles and their oscillations As summarized in Figure 5, we can depict the two document cycles as a continuous oscillation between a broader and narrower framing of Anna?s care. The daily cycles \(small cycles cycle covering Anna?s stay at 10 East. These oscillations involve changes to how broadly and narrowly the documents explicate participants, times places, and content. The cyclical integration mitigates the tension between a documents power to explicate its use and the background knowledge people bring to the document. The two triangles in Figure 5 signify the inverse relationship between documents and users. In the top of the cycle we find documents broadly explicating the relevant participants, times places, and content, thus facilitating understanding by people holding little background knowledge. As we move down in the cycle we see a shift towards documents leaning heavily on users? intimate knowledge of the work but which offers little guidance to the reader 4. 4 Dialog at Beginning &amp; End of Cycles At the beginning and end of each document cycle one finds interactions involving oral communication The dialogs engage the participants in reflections about their patient?s past and future care and stand out as central to the oscillation taking place within each cycle. Doctors and nurses place great emphasis on these meetings. When two interns were asked Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 what time of day they considered the most important they answered in unison: ?Sign-out.? Here, the doctors update their respective resident and senior notes. Each intern and senior resident will report on their patients to their on-call colleague, the doctor 


their patients to their on-call colleague, the doctor staying in the hospital over night. Their conversations focus on the patients that need the most attention during the night, difficult orders and other urgent tasks. It is a time to recount the work done in the course of the day and establish an itinerary for the night. Likewise, the other meetings engage the participants in dialog about individual cases and/or how to manage all patients under their collective care Tensions tend to escalate when a document cycle does not start or end with a reflective encounter Interns quarrel locally about the content of their resident notes during sign-out and attending doctors scold residents during rounds; but it is nothing compared to the anger doctors and nurses express when receiving a document from another setting countering their expectations and with no chance to clarify the problem Primary care doctors regularly complain that the discharge summaries that they receive from other health care settings lack information significant to them. One primary care doctor, Frida, with 18 years tenure grumbled one afternoon about a discharge summary, she had received that afternoon from a surgeon who had set her patient?s leg after a skiing accident a few days earlier. The teenager, Jacob showed up in her clinic with a swollen leg and a rash After examining Jacob, Frida explained to the ethnographer This is a crappy note [from the surgeon]. It?s no help to me. He [the surgeon] does not even tell me what antibiotic he gave Jacob [post operation] and how much. I have no way of telling whether the rash he presents with today is related to the antibiotics Frida calls the surgeon?s office to clarify the issue. The surgeon has left his clinic at 3:00pm. His discharge summary does not provide her enough information to help her diagnose the problem. A flow sheet filled out during the surgery most likely contains the information Frida needs. However, in the discharge papers the surgeon summarized his setting of the leg but does not describe the administration of antibiotic post surgery ? that to him is probably an inconsequential routine Dialog and reflective encounters play a central role in each document cycle. The dialog allows a heterogeneous groups of healthcare professionals with different responsibilities and routines to mend the relationship between the background knowledge people bring to Anna?s care and the degree to which documents explicate relevant participants, times places, content, and form. Such discussions also allow doctors and nurses to question patients? history and their care. By engaging with patients? histories people with different perspectives on care can suggest changes to the configuration of participants times, places and data relevant for the patient Document cycles lacking routine reflective encounters often leave little chance for the different constituencies to clarify their position and repair the relations between documents and their users 5. Discussion More than ten years ago Star and Ruhdeler [1 112] called for a practice-based approach to organizational infrastructure and knowledge flows one that does not depict system integration as a substrate: something upon which something else runs or operates \(e.g., railway system doctors and nurses integrate documents, whether electronic or paper-based, in the course of their daily work allows us to extend such an approach to system 


work allows us to extend such an approach to system integration We find that doctors and nurses continuously transform documents making them relevant to a particular set of participants, times and places. In doing so they adjust the relationship between how much documents explicate and the background knowledge required from the readers. Two such transformations stand out as central First, doctors and nurses engage in a number of cyclical transformations, within which they oscillate between documents addressing a broader and narrower audiences \(see figure 1 and 2 they manage to straddle the demands of local work practices and the needs to coordinate with other teams in other times and places Second, as summarized in figures 1 and 2 one finds a number of transformations between the cyclical organized documents \(e.g., nurse management plans, brain notes, intern notes, senior notes, etc e.g., lab work, flow sheets, orders, etc nurses use their document cycles as the clearing station for a host of document systems. The cyclical organized documents allow people to transform data from peripheral documents into something useful for their immediate work practices. At the same time they draw from their cyclical documents to produce other non-cyclical documents. For instance, Marc and other doctors integrate test results from the laboratory Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 system into their brain notes and later the residence note system. Likewise, they write orders and other request information based on their brain notes The existing literature allows us to capture only parts of these cyclical transformations. Latour and Woolgar [12] and Knorr-Cetina [22] work describes the individual transformations well. The concept of communicative genres [6] offers insights to the individual documents and how they might be linked into sequentially organized genre systems. Likewise we could conceive of the documents in the present case as boundary objects bridging the relations among different communities [3 The cyclical patterns reported here, however present an opportunity to integrate these related practice-based research streams. The concept of communicative genres, for instance, supplements descriptions of document transformation in document cycles. Furthermore, the findings suggest the existence of multiple document types playing different roles in knowledge flows. Boundary objects may not stand alone in knowledge sharing across communities. Rather, they seem to interact with a host of other documents. For instance, one could argue that lab results serve as a boundary object for many groups caring for Anne. As a repository each group can draw from and contribute to the lab result system. Yet, this boundary object does not stand alone. Only when we see the lab result system in relation to the use of nurse management plans, brain notes, intern notes and senior notes do we understand the intricate knowledge flow. The boundary object is but on cog in a larger document machinery Reflection and dialog play central parts in the cyclical integration of documents. Confirming findings in the boundary object literature, conflicts are prone to surface when people from different professions, sub-specialties, or local organizational cultures negotiate their often diverging approaches to patient care [3, 4, 32].  Reflective encounters allow 


patient care [3, 4, 32].  Reflective encounters allow collaborators to recalibrate the reciprocal relationship between documents and organizational members \(i.e document explicates and background knowledge the same time these interactions serve as a staging ground for questions that may broaden or narrow the collective work practices. Doctors and nurses may question whether they need more information about the patient?s medical history or consider alternative treatment plans. The meetings secure an ongoing reflection on the appropriate course of Anna?s care Much like a hermeneutic process, doctors and nurses engage with parts of patients? care ? only to return to a broader picture to interpret the integration of its parts. The movement of their understanding and writing, then, is a constant moving from the whole to its parts and back to the whole [9, 33 Finally, the document cycles offers a window into the institutional structure of the hospital and the temporal and spatial organization of work. We notice how the cycles support departmental divisions and the temporal structure of work in the institution Without these document cycles it would be impossible to maintain the high level of complexity where multiple professions and subdisciplines work together, with somebody present to knowledgably care for Anna 6. Conclusion &amp; Implications The study identifies a cyclical pattern to the knowledge flow in a heterogeneous information systems environment. Drawing on data from the healthcare industry we describe how doctors and nurses organize a host of document systems around a central cyclical pattern involving an oscillation between addressing a broader and narrower configuration of participants, times, places, and content. Numerous documents feed to and from the cyclically organized documents. The constant transformation from one document to the next allows organizational members to manage the reciprocal relationship between how much documents explicate their use and how much background knowledge readers need to bring to the document. This relationship is brittle and despite the many transformations among documents it often breaks down. The research suggests that organizational members build opportunities for dialog into the document cycles in an effort to patch any possible breaks in knowledge sharing The present research is not without limits. It relies on a single in-depth ethnographic study, thereby subjecting it to a set of well-known limitations, most notably restricted empirical generalizability. Despite the limitations, the research has implications for research and practice. First, to fully take advantage of our cyclical notion of documents and integrate the existing practice-based theories require more theoretical and empirical work. For instance, what cyclical patterns do we find beyond the healthcare industry? Second, future research will have to explore how efforts to standardize medical information and facilitate retrieval can coexist with cyclical documenting practices In regard to practice, system design may gain from supporting a host of document types and allow people to transform one document into another document characterized by different configurations of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 participants, times, places, content, and form. Across documents the content may be deceivingly alike. Yet one must keep in mind that each document manages 


an intricate reciprocal relationship between how much the document explicate and the background knowledge people bring to its use Finally, system designers may distinguish circular integration of documents and documents feeding to and from the cycles. People use their central cycles to manage many other document systems. The cycle allows people to transform data from peripheral documents into something useful for their immediate work practices 7.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
