The experimental phase of this study was conducted at the Gas Dynamics Laboratory at Indian Institute of Technology \(IIT\ennai, in a supersonic wind tunnel \(Mach 2\ which is briefly described in the report  The wind tunnel models were indigenously developed and subjected to wind tunnel test at Mach 1.73.

Shock angles for different flow deflection angles were determined and the experimental data was found to be in accordance with the theoretical analysis of the shock  
Attached oblique shock was observed during experimentation of models A and B and detached shock was observed in the third model C. The flow properties and the thermodynamic properties of air before and after the shock were analyzed at Mach 1.73 at zero AOA.

flight. There is a growing need to travel large distances over a short period of time, keeping the environmental impact under view. It is a challenging task for mankind to develop an efficient, reduced sonic boom and environment friendly supersonic transport  In this context, it becomes n ecessary to primarily achieve an optimized supersonic aircra ft profile which produces shock waves of minimal strength considering good aerodynamic efficiency at supe rsonic cruising. To achieve 
an optimized profile, three novel wind tunnel models were fabricated, which were subjected to wind tunnel test at Mach 1.73 and the shock pattern was visualized using the available shadowgraph facility   Figure 1 \226 Tool and Cutter Grinding Machine 
 


 2 The models were fabricated using a tool cutter and grinding machine, central lathe and hand wheel grinder at Velammal Engineering College  Models A and B, of known flow deflection angle, showed an attached oblique shock formation at the apex. The thermodynamic properties of air across the compression wave front at the concave corners were studied and the pressure, temperature and Mach number before and after the shock were found. The shock angle was also determined experimentally. Model C showed a detached shock wave at Mach 1.73 The shape of the detached shock was analyzed and the detachment distance of the shock from the apex was geometrically determined  The above parameters were also checked through theoretical analysis using the oblique shock relations oblique shock solution curve and equations for weak oblique shocks  These supersonic aircraft models were also plotted and meshed using a mesh solver Gambit and were analyzed using CFD Fluent software  2. F ABRICATION O F T HE M ODELS   The three wind tunnel models were fabricated in the Machine Shop facility at Velammal Engineering College Chennai, India. Mild steel \(MS\ate of 5mm thickness was used as the primary fabrication material. MS was chosen so as to give maximum rigidity to the models which is a prime requisite fo r testing in the supersonic wind tunnel \(Mach 2  The holder arrangement of th e supersonic wind tunnel was specified as M12; ther efore it was necessary to provide a threaded end at the models. Hence a MS rod of nominal diameter M12 was al so required to form the integral part of the wind tunnel models  Figure 2 \226 Wind Tunnel Models  The basic design of the models draws inspiration from most supersonic aircrafts existing today. However, care has been taken to vary the designs from the conventional ones. The sectional side views of models A and B reveal ideal supersonic airfoil with sharp leading and trailing edges. This design feature will allow the bow wave to attach to the leading edge thus eliminating the area of high pressure ahead of the wing profile  The blended wing body is featured in these designs. Flying wing designs are defined as having no separate body, only a single wing, though there may be structures protruding from the wing. Blended wing/body aircraft have a flattened and airfoil shaped body, which produces most of the lift to keep itself aloft. The wings were chosen to be of delta type which smoothly blends with the body  According to a research st udy by NASA\222s blended wing body study technology during 1997, the concept was stated to be \223radically efficient\224. However, the tests were done in the high subsonic flow regime \(around Mach 0.8   Figure 3  These profiles were initially marked on the mild steel plate and were gas welded along the profile. The plates were then machined separately in the grinding and machine tool cutter to get three unique profiles  Model A had a wave deflection angle of 12 degrees with respect to the central axis. Th e underside of the profile was kept as flat as possible to ensure good gliding of the aircraft while landing, thus reducing the landing speed.  The cross section of the model was machined to the shape of Double wedge airfoil. The model would thus have least susceptibility to wave drag. This model is characterized by a triangular portion from the nose, with 45 degree angle of apex which smoothly blends into the delta wings of span 4.8cm. The trailing portion of the delta wings is made thin 
 


 3 gradually so as to resemble a Double wedge airfoil across its cross section  A mild steel rod of 12mm diameter was welded towards the underside of the model to facilitate rigid fastening of the model to the supersonic tunnel holder. M12 threads where cut on the extended portion of the rod to screw it into the holder   Figure 4 \226 Side view of Model A  The Model B was fabricated with the same wave angle deflection as model A. However the upper surface of the profile was smoothly curved towards the edges unlike the triangular portion as in Model A. The delta wings were curved towards the ends and were kept as thin as possible The wings were machined such that the cross section of the model resembled Bi-Convex airfoil. The nose was kept very sharp  Mild steel rod with M 12 thread was similarly welded at the underside of the model. Two parallel fillet welds and a transverse fillet weld were performed to ensure high yield stress due to shear and tension forces   Figure 5 \226 Plan View of Model B  The final model C had a width of 6cm and length of 6.5cm The nose portion was made slightly blunt but was smoothly blended along with the body. The wings were made broader than Model A and B and curved with an inclination angle of about 4 degrees with the underside of the model The model viewed from the side shows a subsonic airfoil with a variable camber. Maximum camber is about 0.5cm at a distance of 1 cm from the nose end and it reduces gradually to negligible chamber at the wings. This gives a good aerodynamic structure to the model. A mild steel rod with M 12 thread was welded at the underside similar to the other two wind tunnel models  Wings were made slightly broader to provide sufficient gliding of the aircraft during landing, also providing ground cushioning effect   Figure 6 \226 Plan View of Model C  All the models were spray painted so as to offer minimum resistance to the air flow  Table 1.

 4 3. E XPERIMENTAL S ETUP   These models were tested in the supersonic wind tunnel Mach 2 facility with shadowgraph arrangement available at IIT Chennai, India. The sealing compartment comprised of circular window to view the model under testing conditions  The tunnel operates at maximu m Mach 2.05. It had throat diameter of 5cm and exit diameter as 10.5cm. Beyond the exit chamber, arrangements were provided to rigidly attach the holder firmly   Figure 7 \226 Supersonic Wind Tunnel Setup  The test was conducted only at a single mach number of 1.73 as the wind tunnel had only one fixed nozzle The sealing compartments with circular windows were used due to the unavailability of rectangular windows. The disadvantage of using the circular window compartment was that the entire model was not visible in the shadowgraph during testing. Only a part of the aircraft profile models could be visualized   The available shadowgraph setup was used to visualize the flow and the shock pattern during the test. The shadowgraph setup consisted of a sodium vapor light source, a pin hole, highly polished reflecting mirror and a screen where the shadow was observed. Pin hole was used to converge the light beam, resulting in higher intensity of the light. To ensure an uniform level from the datum, these components were mounted on tripod stands  A high speed movie camera was installed behind the shadowgraph screen to record the shock wave formation at the section of the wind tunnel models during testing  A central compressor was used to compress atmospheric air to the operating pressure conditions of the wind tunnel. The outlet of the compressor fed the charged air into the inlet of the tunnel  The sealing windows \(two required\ consisted of a gasket to seal the entire chamber to prevent any possible leakage of air flowing through the tunnel. Each sealing windows were provided with fourteen 10mm holes to enable fastening them to the tunnel with screws and bolts of required nominal size  This was the overall experimental setup used to study and analyze the shock pattern and shock characteristics over three fabricated wind tunnel models   Figure 8 \226 The holder fixed within the tunnel 
 


 5 4. E XPERIMENTAL A NALYSIS   Model A was screwed into the holder of the Mach 2 tunnel in an orientation such that the nose pointed towards the direction of airflow   Figure 9 \226 Model A screwed into the holder The sealing compartment with circular glass window was aligned with the provision present along the boundaries of the nozzle and was held in position with screws. The entire chamber was checked for leakage after sealing it with both the windows  The shadowgraph setup was placed and the model was focused on the screen. However, as already mentioned earlier, due to the unavailability of the rectangular glass windows, only a part of the model could be projected on the shadowgraph screen  As seen in the picture, the re d circle denotes the projected shadow on the screen.  The wind tunnel was operated at a pressure of about 25kg/cm 2 atmosphere and using the high speed camera, the flow was visualized  Figure 10 \226 Shadowgraph setup and th e model projected on the screen  Assumptions were made to reduce the complexities arising from the experimental analysis of the shock wave formation on the shadowgraph screen. First, the flow was considered to be isentropic fo r steady state analysis. That is there was no heat transfer acr oss the boundaries throughout the flow. Second, the nozzle was assumed to be frictionless thus entropy at the inlet and the outlet remains constant  The other two models B and C were similarly tested at Mach 1.73 and the shock pattern on the leading profiles were studied. Model wise experimental analysis was done  Analysis of Model A  Model A when subjected to the tunnel test gave the following results, tested at M ach 1.73. An attached shock was noted to be forming on the shadowgraph, using the high speed motion camera. The particular frame at which the shock intensity was observed to be maximum, was captured and further geometric analysis like the shape of the shock wave, type of shock wave and shock angle were done. The following picture gives that particular instant at which shock wave was observed in Model A  
 


 6 Figure 11 \226 Shock wave formation at Model A \(Zoomed frame   The resulting shock wave can be thus seen on the shadowgraph screen. The following observations were made from this shock pattern  
200  An attached shock wave was observed, inclined at an angle to the flow. Thus the wave maybe an oblique shock wave  Oblique shock waves occur when a supersonic flow is deflected towards itself. The m odels had concave plan form leading edges; therefore the co rners turned the flow into itself giving rise to an oblique shock formation   Figure 12 \226 Supersonic flow over compression corners  In the above diagram, the flow deflection angle is 12 degrees for Model A, as mentioned in section 3. All the streamlines are deflected to the same angle at the shock resulting in uniform parallel flow downstream of the shock Across such a shock wave, the Mach number decreases and the pressure, temperature and density of the fluid increases. The angle that is formed by the shock wave with the corner is called the shock angle   The observed oblique shock was inclined at an angle with Model A. This angle was geom etrically determined to be around 50 degrees. The pressure before the shock, P 1 was found to be 0.2 bar  Therefore, experimental analys is of Model A at Mach 1.73 using a shadowgraph was  50 degrees P 1 0.2 bars  Analysis of Model B  Model B had the same flow deflection angle as that of model A. The shock pattern observed in Model B was identical to the pattern over model A. Therefore its experimentation leaded to similar analysis as done for Model A  However, a different phenomenon was observed during testing of Model B. While increasing the Mach number in the tunnel, the model was seen to roll and pitch up about its axis. This phenomenon could be attributed to two reasons 1  The design of the model gave good aerodynamic properties, which resulted in lifting up of the model 
200  The flow was not one dimensional. Therefore, it rules out the possibility of normal shock wave formation 
 


 7 2  The rolling could be attributed to improper tightening of the screw end of the model into the holder   Analysis of Model C Model C was tested finally at same Mach number and pressure. The frame caught by the high speed motion camera showed a detached shock wave formation in front of the nose  Figure 13 \226 Shock wave formation at Model C   This is the shock which results when the wall deflection angle is greater than max   According to the  M relationship, such shocks have no rigorous analytical treatment as explained in section 5. The shape of the detached shock and its detachment distance depend on the geometry of the object faci ng the flow and the Mach number before the shock  The following observations were made from this shock formation at Model C  
200  The detachment distance was found geometrically to be 0.3cm from the nose  The strength of the detached shock was maximum near the stagnation streamline, where it is approximated as a normal shock, and then it continuously decreases by becoming oblique as seen in the frame  Therefore the experimental analysis of the detached shock wave was 200  Distance of detachment from nose = 0.3cm 200  Shape of the detached shock was studied and could be approximated to be a normal shock  5  T HEORETICAL A NALYSIS   The experimental values of shock angle for Models A and B were verified using the  M relationship. For each wave angle at a given mach number M 1 there is a corresponding flow turning angle that is can also be expressed as a unique function of M 1 and With trigonometric manipulation from the basic isentropic expressions, the final expression can be written to show the dependence of explicitly as    The results for various values of and for different mach numbers can be plotted in form of a curve. This curve is called as oblique shock solution curve. The following 
200  The shape of the detached shock wave was observed to be concave in shape with respect to the nose. It can be approximated to a normal shock 
 


 8  Figure 14 \226 Oblique Shock Solution   observations can be made from the oblique shock solution curve as explained in the later paragraphs   The following observations can be made from the curve 
200  For any given M 1 there is a maximum value of  Therefore, at a given M 1   if  max then no solution is possible for a straight oblique shock wave. In such cases, the shock will be curved and detached 200  When  max there are two possible solutions for each value of and M, having two different wave angles. The large value of is called the strong shock solution and the smaller value of is called as the weak shock solution For strong solution the flow behind the shock becomes subsonic. For weak shock solution the flow remains supersonic, except for a small angle range values slightly smaller than max  200  If 0, then  2, gives rise to normal shock, or decreases to the limiting value that is shock disappears and only Mach waves prevail in the flow field  It is important to note that oblique shocks are essentially compression fronts across which the flow decelerates and the pressure, temperature and density jump to higher values. If the deceleration is such that the Mach number behind the shock continues to be  greater than unity, the shock is termed weak oblique shock If the downstream Mach numbe r becomes less than unity then the shock is called strong oblique shock corresponding to the upper portion of figure 14    It is essential to note that only weak oblique shocks are usually formed and it calls for special arrangements to generate strong oblique shocks  The relationship between the pressure before and after the oblique shock wave can be given by the equation    The Mach number behind the shock M 2 can be determined from the relation  
 


 9   These parameters were calculated using the relations  Analysis of Model A and B  Since both models A and B had same wave deflection angle the analysis gave similar results  For M 1 1.73, ratio of specific heats 1.4 and 12 degrees the ratio of pressure after and before the shock was calculated to be 1.920  The Mach number after the shock was found to be 1.25, it shows that it is still in supersonic regime and therefore the oblique shock formed is a weak oblique shock  Wave angle is also given by the sum of the Mach angle  and small angular difference Therefore      Here is given by the relation   1 1 2 4 \(M 1 2 226 1    That is, for a finite deflection angle the direction of weak oblique shock wave differs from the Mach wave direction  by an amount which is of the same order as   The Mach wave direction was calculated as 35 degrees and was calculated to be around 12 degrees. Sum of these two parameters gave the wave angle to be 40 degrees This is in good accordance with the experimental analysis of Models A and B, which is about 50 degrees  Pressure and temperature before and after the shocks were calculated from the isentropic relationships as the flow was assumed to be isentropic. The following values were determined  P1 = 0.197 bar = 19.7kPa P2 = 0.38 bar = 38kPa  T1 = 187.8 K T2 = 228.6 K  Analysis of Model C  Detached shock was observed near the nose of Model C This shock resulted as the wall deflection angle was greater than max Model C had was designed to have a blunt nose. In such a case, the shock wave remains detached at all supersonic Mach numbers. The flow immediately behind the shock was subsonic. It was difficult to determine the sonic line  The analysis of the flow fiel d associated with detached shock becomes very difficult because of transonic flow which prevails behind the shock. In such a case, the shape of the shock was observed and the detachment distance was determined. It becomes co mplicated to measure the properties in such rarefied flows. Hence the following parameters were found  The detachment distance was found to be 0.3cm from the nose of the model and the shape of the detached shock resembled conventional detached shock wave. However oblique shocks were noticed towards the downstream flow over the model as marked in the picture. The strength of the detached shock waves weakens with the formation of the oblique shock and further weakens until it becomes a Mach line, far away from the object. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of rectangular windows the entire section of the model could not be studied  6. F LUENT S OFTWARE A NALYSIS   Fluent is a general purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. Fluent technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. Th is software was chosen to compute, analyze and model the flow conditions in and around moving models  The wind tunnel models were modeled in Gambit software package and two dimensional analyses was done. Two dimensional analyses were to simplify the complexities arising from turbulent flow model analysis. The top and side views of the models were meshed using Gambit and were exported to Fluent to model the flow conditions  The 2ddp version in Fluent was used. The flow was modeled using density based solver, k-epsilon viscous model was used and properties of air were assumed to be constant. The analysis was done for normal supersonic cruising conditions at 50000 ft at a pressure of 12000 Pa and temperature 216 K. The Mach number was set to about 1.8 for analyzing Model A and B and sonic Mach number for Model C  Analysis of Model B  The top and sectional side views of the model were plotted and meshed using Gambit mesh solver. The mesh was imported in Fluent and the operating conditions were set as stated in the previous paragraphs. The analysis gave contours of pressure, temperat ure, velocity, Mach number and turbulence      
 


 10    The above contour shows static pressure distribution across the model. It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
