227Designing, building, and launching missions to deploy space based sensors typi cally take many years and cost billions of dollars. Missions are often delayed or canceled, and data from some parts of the world may be unavailable. When a physical sensor is unavailable for any reason, we propose the notion of a virtual sensor,   in which we exploit the hundreds of sp aced based sensors already observing the earth along with statistical learning algorithms to fuse the data from multi-sensor data to estimate a virtual sensor image The algorithm we present in this paper uses several physical source sensors to build a 
virtual target sensor with different characteristics and higher resolution than the source sensors. The approach is based on finding the target sensor data that Maximizes the APosteriori \(MAP\probability.  We solve the MAP problem by using a Bayesian network framework We present a proof of con cept case that shows we can predict the values of a 500m resolution band 3 data, using 1km resolution images from bands 8, 9, and 10, in Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer \(MODIS We test the performance of our algorithm by predicting target sensor data for which we have a ground truth data based on criterion of root mean square error. The results 
show the effectiveness of our approach 1 2   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  R ELATED W ORK 2  3  DATA 3  4  M

Then the data are fused from several sensors to produce a virtual sensor image.  This virtual sensor image is computed by an algorithm that best approximates the image that would have been produced by a desired real physical sensor had it been available  In this paper, we present an algorithm to synthesize data from several physical source sensors to build a virtual target

  2 adapt to missing data, and integrate domain knowledge as prior conditions, statistical image analysis and machine learning provide a natural framework for this approach   In Bayesian language  i f t h e aggregat i on of al l t h e dat a  available is denoted Y, and the computed virtual image is denoted X, then our goal becomes computing the image X that maximizes the conditional probability P\(X|Y\th X and Y are variables with millions of degrees of freedom X|Y\ have a simple description, thus  the challenge is to make reasonable assumptions on the structure of the data in order to make the computation of X tractable while still accurate  A related problem of learning based Super Resolution \(SR has been studied in computer vision. To understand that problem, it is important to note that the traditional SR problem comes from the observation that most imaging sensors \(cameras\o not filter the images they acquire to the Niquest frequencies of their sampling resolution. As a result, sub-pixel information is present in an image that can be recovered if one has multiple images with different displacements. Signal processing is used to create a virtual HR image from multiple LR images. In contrast learning based SR relies on the observation that natural images have statistical patterns which correlate information at different frequencies. Edges in a natural scene, for example, usually represent a one dimensional discontinuity creating correlations at infinitely high frequencies. The approach of learning based resolution then is to discover these correlations statistically from a large training set of HR images and the corresponding lower resolution images. If we use X to denote the HR image of the type we would like to obtain, and Y the LR imag es we can actually acquire then the goal is use the training to provide parameters p to a nonlinear regression function f so that the result of X =f\(Y is an image which maximizes P\(X|Y  In constructing virtual remote sensors, our interest is not limited to determining HR images from LR ones. For example, we may have images measured at several different spectral wavelengths none of which are at the wavelength optimal for our application. As a proof of concept, we will take an example data from three selected bands of the MODIS imager and show that we can predict a fourth band which has been measured at a higher resolution and a spectral frequency not included in the original images  This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce an overview of related work. In section 3 and 4 we present the used data and the motivation of our work which is based on Freeman for solving the virtual sensors problem. Our approach is presented in section 5 Experimental results and performance evaluations are presented in section 6. Finally we conclude the paper and sketch our plans for future work in section 7 2  R ELATED W ORK  Constructing HR images is important for capturing the fine features in many applications such as climate change, video quality enhancement, image compression, biometrics medical imaging, satellite images, military, etc [3 h er resolution images are associ ated with higher cost and limitation of optical sensors. Enlarging the spatial resolution of the image using bilinear, nearest neighbor, or cubic spline interpolation [6 b l u r th e im ag e d etails corresponding to the high frequencies of the image or create periodic artifacts at discontinuities   Traditionally, reconstruction based approaches and learning based approaches are the two main categories of SR techniques. In the reconstruction based approaches, SR can be considered as reconstruction techniques of HR images from a sequence of LR images or video frames of the same  en t of the LR images is the main challenge in these kinds of approaches. However when the image magnificati on factor increases, the extracted information provided by reconstruction constraints decreases. In additi on, the camera\222s point spread function parameters should be known in   In the learni SR  can be appl i e d on sequence of LR images or on a single image. The concept is 1\ to build sufficient and representative database of patches pairs from HR images and their corresponding LR images or the coefficients of alternative representation 2\ to train the system the o ccurrence of HR patch from LR patch, and 3\o add the appropriate high frequency or smoothing information to LR image after searching process The main drawback of these a pproaches is their dependency on the training set and the results may be biased to the training sets  Regarding SR problem of satellite images, all approaches presented in the literature focused on generating HR satellite images from LR images for the same scene. For example, Shen et al proposed a SR reconstruction algorithm to MODIS remote sensing images [16  Th ey first used truncated quadratic cost function to eliminate the outlier pixels and to simulta neously obtain photometric and geometric registration parameters. After that they used L1 norm data fidelity and Huber prior for maintaining sharp details in the reconstruction process. The approach was applied on MODIS band-4 images for the same view taken at different dates to reconstruct HR image for the same scene  Miravet and Rodr\355guez proposed a SR approach based on hybrid Multilayer Perceptron Probabilistic neural network MLP-PNN im age is predicted by processing representation coefficients on the local windows. They reduce th e data dimensionality using Principle Component Analysis \(PCA\hen train the MLP network using synthetic sequences with noise 
 


  3 inference at different levels These synthetic sequences have been produced from HR images captured by IKONOS satellite imaging system  Fusion systems integrate and fuse different signals from multiple sensors or sources to overcome the limitations of signal systems including imprecision, uncertainty, and noise to obtain robust and reliable results. However, there is no data-fusion technique that performs well for all data because diverse sensors and sensor networks have unique characteristics and limitations. Thus, data fusion algorithms must generally be custom designed taking into consideration that data from any sensor will not corrupt data from the ot There are several  dat a  fusi on techniques such as particle filtering, neural network, fuzzy integral, and Bayesian network which can be useful and powerful techniques for SR problem 3  DATA The data used in this research is MODIS data. NASA Launched MODIS into Earth orbit Terra M ODIS was launched on 1999 and it has collected data about the Earth from north to south across the equator in the morning. Aqua MODIS was launched on 2002 and it has collected data from south to north in the afternoon. The data of entire earth are captured by the MODIS every one to two days

In the first approach, they use Markov network to model the relationship between the HR patches and LR patches, and between the neighboring HR patches. To make the computation processes tractable, they apply Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm to get an approximate solution. In the second approach, they proposed one pass algorithm which is as good as Markov network. The idea behind one pass algorithm is that instead of finding the relationship between 
Both source and target data sets are typically high dimensional. For instance since the bands 8,9, and 10 are each 1254x2030 images, our source data is 8,245,860 dimensional. On the other hand, our target data is 10,994,480 dimensional 
MODIS data is essential for development of Earth system models weather prediction, forest fire smoke detection, and other environmental issues  The idea behind choosing MODIS data for this problem is that MODIS acquires data in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 \265m to 14.4 \265m at different spatial resoluti The t y pe of M ODIS dat a  can be consi d ered as temporal\226spatio data. Bands 1 and 2 capture the data at 250m resolution; bands 3 through 7 capture the data at 500m resolution; and bands 8 through 36 capture data at 1km resolution. As an example of the spectral range of the data bands, the bandwidths of bands 3, 8, 9, and 10 are [459  405 \226 420 438 \226 448 and [483 \226 493  nm  respectively. Essentially, MODI S measures the visible and infrared radiation to derive the information about land ocean, vegetation, cloud, aerosols properties and 
all pairs in the belief propagation algorithm, they find the relationship between neighboring patches  We will adapt the basic frame work that Freeman et al developed for super resolution in order to implement virtual sensor algorithm. Because thei r formulation assumed that there source data was a single LR image, and the target data is a single HR image over the same portion of the scene their framework is not directly applicable. In particular, they assumed that the LR image re presents, in frequency space, a sub-dataset of the HR image. Our work is perhaps much closer in spirit to Hertzman's work on im In that work, Hertzman tried to synthesize images with the characteristics of one training sample, for instance paintings, from corresponding samples photographs of that same scene. Similarly, our source data and target data are related but our source data is acquired at different spectral wavelengths from the target data. Another difference from both the work of Herzman and Freeman is that our input source data may come from multiple images. While any single band may not have enough information to produce a high quality approximation of the target band, an aggregation may 5  A PPROACH  In this paper, the focus is on computing a target virtual band 3 data from directly from source bands 8, 9, and 10 data of the same view of the Earth so that it matches the actual band 3 data, without knowledge of it. We will use the actual band 3 data only for training and evaluation. We show the ability of predicting certain modality from different multiple modalities based on the concept of data fusion. At high level of abstraction, the proposed system consists of two main stages: training stage and prediction phase including making decision criterion  Training Phase

In general, finding the optimal solution of the HR patches using MRF model is intractable. In addition, the computation process is highly costly al  find the approximate solution using Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm and one pass algorithm as simpler machinery to obtain the HR patches. Therefore, we employ one pass algorithm presented by Freeman to exploit the relationship between the LR and HR data taking into consideration the neighborhood relation in the HR patches  
We create a training set of corresponding source and target data. We collect the corresponding LR source and HR target data and use them to generate feature vectors and their corresponding HR vectors in a manner that help us in the later steps. Basically, we divide the LR source data \(Bands 8, 9, and 10\he HR source data \(band 3\into patches whose size are NxN and MxM pixels respectively. The feature vector contains the information of LR source data from bands 8, 9, and 10 in addition to HR target information of neighboring patches from bands 3. The neighboring patches of HR target data are the patches on left, upper left, upper, and upper right of the HR patch Figure 1 
In the predicting phase, only the LR source data of bands 8 9, and 10 are available for constructing their corresponding HR source data of band 3. Figure 3 shows the Markov Random Field \(MRF\ for learning based SR for MODIS data band 3. Each patch of band 3 and its corresponding observed patches in bands 8, 9, and 10 are nodes in the Markov network. Links between these nodes indicate statistical dependences. The compatibility function defines the compatibility between neighboring HR nodes while the compatibility function  and define the compatibility between the observed nodes of LR band 8,9 and 10 and the input LR band 8, 9, and 10 respectively. The possible states of HR nodes are extracted from the training data based on the closest patches to the input nodes. The posterior probability of high resolution patches in the MRF can be defined as    103 93 83  33 10983 ii i ii ii ji ji BBBBBB BB BBBBP

shows the process of creating feature vector and its corresponding HR patch from bands 3, 8, 9 and 10  To decrease the complexity of high dimensionality and the search process, we build a tree of clusters and each cluster is clustered into sub-clusters based on K-mean clustering  Figure 2 
 


The prediction will sequentially be processed in raster scan order, from left to right and from up to down. At each step the input of prediction is the LR source data of bands 8, 9 and 10 in combination with the predicted target patches on up and left of the current processed patch in the raster scan order. Figure 4 shows the steps of predicting phase. From the LR data and neighboring HR patches predicted from the previous stages, we create th e feature vector in same manner presented in the previous section. We search in the training data for the closest 10 feature vectors based on L2 norm. The number 10 was chosen manually to adjust the computational resources we had available and the size of our training data.  We define the first 10 matches as candidate lists that contain two lists of feature vector and corresponding expected HR vectors. In decision making stage, we predict the HR patch from candidate list using compatibility criterion 
We build training database from seven files of MODIS level 1B data \(MOD021KM\th 1km resolution and their corresponding seven files of MODIS data \(MOD02HKM with 500m resolution. These data are in HFD format and belong to sections 2, 3, and 4 captured in the morning time between 8:05 am to 11:40 am on 2007. We dump the binary data from MODIS files using HDF4 library, and then we extract the LR bands 8, 9, 10 from MOD021KM and HR band 3 from MOD02HKM. The data type is unsigned 16 bits integers and the size of data in LR and HR bands are 2030/2040x1354 and 4060/4080x2708 respectively  For testing the proposed approach, we used five different 50x50 pixels\regions of MODIS level 1B data MOD021KM\ that belongs to section 1 captured at 8:15 am on 2007. The corresponding MODIS data MOD02HKM\with resolution 500m is used as reference data for evaluation process. After extracting the LR data of bands 8, 9, and 10, we used the proposed approach presented in section 5 in order to predict their corresponding HR data  Our experiments for predicting based on compatibility are implemented using different sizes of HR patches. For the small/large size, we chose 3x3/7x7 HR patches for band 3 and their corresponding 3x3/5x5 LR patches for bands 8, 9 and 10. We built two different databases for this purpose. In the predicting process, we assume that the overlapping between the HR patches will occu r in the first column with the left predicted HR patch and in the last row with the upper predicted HR patch  Figure 6 shows the prediction result of our algorithm applied on three 50x50 pixels of bands 8, 9, and 10 based on compatibility criterion using small patches. The predicted data has the same stru cture for different regions as shown in three circles and most of the details have been correctly captured. However, because of presence of

We choose 2N>M in a manner that makes the HR data come from a similar location or properties in the training data. In addition, the idea of overlapping the HR patches is to make sure that the edges of predicted HR patch agree from above and left neighboring patches \(Figure 5

It shows that prediction using large patches has closer visualization to the referen ce image than the one using small patches.

As can be seen, all hypotheses except one could be supported. Executive support reveals a high and significant impact on operational IT business alignment \(H7 ably mediated by both strategic IT business alignment and governance mechanisms. Both links \(H5, H6 very strong and significant, too. The corresponding hypotheses from strategic IT business alignment \(H2 and governance mechanisms \(H4 business alignment could also be supported.

PLS results  In order to test the validity of the mediating effect via operational alignment on process performance, we tested two alternative models containing \(1 direct links from ES, SA, GM on process performance or \(2 performance. In the first case, the R2 of process performance increased slightly from 25.4% to 26.3% with all added direct links being insignificant. In the second model the R2 dropped down to 20.9%. Consequently we can argue that operational alignment as a mediating factor contributes to the explanation of process performance  5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Further Research 5.1. Limitations  As our model was partly derived from prior work on successful alignment practices, the theoretical scope is certainly limited and especially the opportunistic selection of the governance tools is not exhaustive and can and should be substantially extended. We still decided in favor of our approach because particularly the measurement model for alignment and governance tools has been refined and validated in a previous large survey [6, 7, 8 The empirical evaluation might be subject to nonresponse and common method bias. In order to control for non-response bias, one should carefully compare the data of early and late respondents [2]. The reason is that late respondents share similarities with nonrespondents [44]. Accordingly, we compared late responding banks \(i.e. answering after the second reminder, N=27 N=55 significant differences in answering the items used in this analysis According to [53], common method bias refers to the amount of variance explained by the measurement method rather than by the constructs represented by the measures. Common method bias may be existent when the predictor and the criterion variables are taken from only one source \(Podsakoff et al. 2003 for our survey as we merely asked one person in each bank. To sufficiently address the issue of common method bias, Podsakoff et al. [53] recommend both procedural and statistical remedies. The first ones deal with the questionnaire design prior to data collection the latter ones with both detection and control of common method bias inside the data. In our survey, procedural remedies have been addressed by conducting pretests to identify complex or ambiguous items, which then were deleted or adjusted. Furthermore, we in 


then were deleted or adjusted. Furthermore, we included reverse-coded items to avoid acquiescence effects and ensured anonymity to the respondents to encounter social desirability effects. As statistical remedy, we applied Harman?s single-factor test which did not identify a single component explaining all or the majority of the overall variance extracted Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 5.2. Conclusion and Further Research  Theoretically integrating key findings from IT value, IT business alignment and IT governance research, we show the tantamount role of executive support and operational alignment from a governance perspective. Executive support directly and significantly drives not only strategy and operational alignment but also IT governance tools, and indirectly business process performance To summarize, the main findings are  The impact of IT governance mechanisms on success is mediated by strategic and operational alignment  The lack of a significant relation between strategic alignment and governance mechanisms highlights the gap between strategy and strategy implementation. Generally, it is quite obvious that strategic alignment is required as a foundation for effective IT governance, but our test results show that it is not necessarily a driver as well. Firms that are strategically aligned still need to make substantial efforts in order to implement alignment on the operational level as well and, thus, increase IT effectiveness and process performance. Of course, there might be many different reasons why a firm, which has high strategic alignment does not set up the appropriate IT governance tools, such as improper organizational structures, missing budgets and capacities, missing focus of top management due to competitive pressure and others  Executive support is strongly correlated with all alignment dimensions and governance mechanisms  What does that mean from a practitioner?s perspective First, executive support of alignment is a strong driver of all facets of alignment and intensity of the applied governance mechanisms. An analysis of the total effects of the two executive support indicators regarding operational alignment \(i.e. total effect of construct outer weight of indicator agement support for interplay between business and IT 0.320 0.117 of considerable importance. Second, strategic alignment is surely an enabler of high process performance but does not necessarily translate into success. It is thus important to actively select adequate governance tools to establish operational alignment. Focusing on the total impact of the different governance tools we assessed regarding operational alignment \(again measured by the total effect of construct * outer weight of indicator back office proactively into IT planning \(0.428 the existence of liaison units \(0.058 rewarding good interaction \(0.054 erately important Finally, we think that our results open some potentially relevant avenues for further research. Further strengthening the governance alignment nexus might help getting an even better understanding of how the IT resource can be used successfully and in particular how relational mechanisms like those mentioned above interact with strategic and structural properties of a 


interact with strategic and structural properties of a firm Also, as we see growing amounts of regulation and stronger public reactions to how firms conduct their business, compliance issues have received increased attention. Especially from an IT governance perspective, two questions are exciting to ask: How are alignment and compliance related, i.e. to what extent can or should the dimensions of alignment be an explicit part of compliance activities? And one step further: As regulation regarding internal controls like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the USA affects almost all IT activities [61] this is a highly relevant issue. From an IT business value perspective, IT business alignment may be a driver but IT compliance may act as a constraint In practice, combining the demands for compliance and value delivery of IT is widely seen as the domain of IT governance [43]. This leads to the second question: Is there a positive business value impact from compliance beside just being compliant, i.e. do improvements from better governance/alignment structures and actions would have been worth the effort even without external regulatory pressure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 References   1] Alavi, M. and Leidner, D.E., "Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues", MIS Quarterly 25\(1 2] Armstrong, J.S. and Overton, T.S., "Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys", Journal of Marketing Research, 14 3] Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., and Wilson, D., "Using and Validating the Strategic Alignment Model", Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13\(3 4] Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., and Mukhopadhyay, T., "Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation", Information Systems Research, 6\(1 5] Bassellier, G. and Benbasat, I., "Business Competence of Information Technology Professionals: Conceptual Development and Influence on IT-Business Partnerships MIS Quarterly, 28\(4 6] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Gomber, P., Wagner, H.-T and Weitzel, T., "Die Bedeutung des Alignments von IT und Fachressourcen in Finanzprozessen: Eine empirische Untersuchung", Wirtschaftsinformatik, 48\(5 339 7] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of outsourcing on IT business alignment and IT flexibility: a survey in the German banking industry",  Twelfth Americas Conference on Information Systems AMCIS 8] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "Strategy matters - The role of strategy type for IT business value",  12th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS 9] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of operational alignment on IT flexibility Empirical evidence from a survey in the German banking industry",  13th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS CO 10] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The Influence of Alignment on the PostImplementation Success of a Core Banking Information System: An Embedded Case Study",  40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences \(HICSS Big Island \(HI

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
