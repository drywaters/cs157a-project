   9 The imaging payload field of view and field of regard are used by the mission modeling capabilities to determine feature of interest access and coverage metrics 5  COTS  SPS  P ROTOTYPING  Figure 6 is an overview of the prototype work flow functionality needed for a COTS implementation of the GetCapabilities, DescribeTasking, and GetFeasibility operations of an SPS Data exchanges between a User and an SPS are specified by a schema.  The prototype em ploys Spacecraft Capabilities Tasking Definition, and Acquisition Feasibility schema They are not intended to be one-off versions of the GetCapabilities, DescribeTasking, and GetFeasibility schema.  They are sparse schemas that support the design of the data exchanges needed for employing AGI mission modeling capabilities The sparse schema is used for the first prototyping steps The schema will be brought in to compliance with the SPS Implementation Specification in the final steps of prototyping SpacecraftCapabilities The Spacecraft Capabilities Reque st schema, illustrated in Figure 6, consists of Country and Payload Type elements These are the elements define d in the spacecraft schema\222s Spacecraft Classification and Pa yload Operations elements If the User does not specify a country, the search will include all countries.  The Payload Type can be Optical Imager or Radar Imager.  If a Payload Type is not specified the search will include both imagers The User populates the Spacecraft Capabilities Request XML document and sends it to the PoC-SPS where it is received and parsed.  The PoC-SPS searches and retrieves Spacecraft Classification and Pa yload Operation data from the SOC, populates the Sp acecraft Capabilities Response XML document, and sends it to the User AcquisitionFeasibility The User receives and pars es the Spacecraft Capabilities Response XML document and selects the applicable spacecraft and imaging payloads.  The User populates the Acquisition Feasibility Request XML document and sends it to the PoC-SPS where it is received and parsed The Acquisition Feasibility Request schema, illustrated in Figure 6, contains Spacecraft Pa yload Pairing, Feature of Interest, and Acquisition Constraints The request also includes the radar scan mode from Radar Payload Operation element if th e imager is a Radar Imager A Feature of Interest is defined by a ground point A full set of acquisition constraints includes geometric temporal, environmental, and quality. Examples of acquisition constraints for an Op tical Imager are: geometric slant range elevation angle range, temporal - time of day interval, environmental - solar elevation angle range, and quality - ground sample resolution range The PoC-SPS does not incorporate ground sample resolution since it requires knowledge of the detector configuration.  For example, an optical detector would require, at a minimum, detector focal length and pixel width.  However, a User can select an imaging payload based on its ground sample resolution provided in the Spacecraft Capabilities Response XML document The PoC-SPS receives and processes the Acquisition Feasibility Request.  The spacecraft payload pairing is used to retrieve the payload field of regard from the SOC and the spacecraft orbital elements from CelesTrak, the authoritative source of NORAD or bital elements.  Then the AGI Components are activated to determine the Acquisition Feasibility Response The payload field of regard is used instead of the field of view because it corresponds to the in-track and cross-track range that the payload could be pointed The Acquisition Feasibility Response sequence contains a number of acquisition interval start and stop times and corresponding acquis ition geometry The PoC-SPS populates the AcquisitionFeasibilityResponse XML document and provides it to the User The User can request Acquisition Feasibility Responses from a number of potential DPs and select the DP that best satisfies the User needs 6  F IRE S AT S YS ML   AGI  C OMPONENTS I NTERFACE P ROTOTYPING  The interaction between the SPS operations and AGI Components is the basis of the interaction between a FireSat SysML model and AGI Components SysML is a domain-specific modeling language for systems engineering.  SysML is an extension of a subset of Unified Modeling Language \(UML\L is used to specify visualize, construct, and document the artifacts of an objectoriented software-intensi ve system.  SysML can accommodate the integration of an engineering model\222s inputs and outputs within the SysML component

   11 The SysML model is of a hypothetical FireSat system - a space-based system for det ecting, identifying, and monitoring forest fires.   It is derived from the description in Space Mission Analysis and Design Third Edition, by Wiley J. Larson and James R. Wertz \(editors modeling is an International Council of Systems Engineering \(INCOSE\odel Based System Engineering MBSE\ilot project One of the goals of the FireSat MBSE pilot project is to develop an interface between the FireSat SysML model and STK/AGI Components The FireSat system consists of users, mission satellites communications satellites, and ground stations.  The SysML model is used to carryout trade studies of system design performance, and cost   The FireSat SysML model is created with MagicDraw 256  from No Magic and uses ParaMagic\231 from InterCAX to carry out trade studies.  Para Magic integrates Microsoft Excel, MATLAB 256 Simulink 256 and Mathematica into MagicDraw SysML models.  InterCAX is prototyping the SysML interface with AGI Components Figure 7 is an overview of how a FireSat SysML model could interact with AGI Components to carry out trade studies on FireSat system elements There are two types of interactions.  The first is a setup of the scenario elements cache c ontaining candidate spacecraft imaging payloads, relays, and ground stations.  These candidate elements are populated from the FireSat system elements pool.  This pool contains all of the FireSat elements and variations under consideration. The second interaction is a series of elements selections, accessibility queries, and coverage queries The accessibility and coverage data returned by AGI Components are used to assess FireSat measures of effectiveness.  Examples ar e area covered, revisit time memory margin, and power margin The accessibility and coverage data are also used to assess FireSat resource usage strategies, e.g 
200  Communication link availability for command uplink telemetry downlink, and image downlink 200  Memory used for image storage versus memory freed up by downlink during and after imaging 200  Power used for image collection and downlink versus power replenished during sunbathing and normal operations The current prototyping of the interaction between the FireSat SysML model and AGI Components is confined to the data exchange interface of Figure 8 200  Scenario Elements Initialization 200  Accessibility Chain Request and Response 200  Feature Coverage Request and Response The spacecraft orbit is modeled w ith the standard set of six orbital elements.  The imaging payload is modeled with rectangular or conic field of view half angles and a direction of pointing in the spacecraft re ference frame.  The field of view is modeled, instead of the field of regard, since it represents the extent of the coverage capability at any instance of time. The field of regard represents the potential coverage Accessibility chains are used to determine time intervals of accessibility through a string of serially linked scenario elements As an example, take a chain consisting of a feature of interest, a mission spacecraft, a relay spacecraft, and a ground station.  The chain capability determines the intervals of time that the missi on spacecraft is in view of the feature of interest and the rela y and, at the same time, the relay is in view of the ground station.  In view means that the lines of sights between th e elements satisfy viewing constraints A feature of interest, an imaging payload on a mission spacecraft, a relay spacecraft, and a ground station chain is more restrictive since line of si ght to the feature of interest must be within the imaging payload field of view. The satellite can image the feature of interest and downlink the image through the relay satellite during these intervals of time The feature of interest can be a point or an area.  An area is defined by a set of latitude, longitude, and altitude vertices connected by straight lines.  The AGI Components coverage capability fills in the area with grid points with a user defined spacing The user also selects among the following figure of merits for area coverage 200  Area covered, i.e. square kilometers 200  Percent of area covered 200  Area covered in each time interval 200  Minimum, maximum, and average response times 200  Minimum, maximum, and average revisit times 
 


   12 The response time is a measure of the time between a request for coverage of an area grid point and the time at which coverage is achieved The revisit time is a measure of the intervals during which coverage of a grid point is not provided, also known as coverage gaps 7  C URRENT S TATUS AND F UTURE P LANS  The SOC is currently populated with Earth observation navigation, communications and technology development spacecraft as well as ground facilities that support spacecraft launch and operations The SOC contains 59 Earth observation satellites from 20 countries.  There are 44 optical imaging satellites with a total of 116 operating modes, and 15 radar imaging satellites with a total of 66 operating modes.  An optical operating mode is a combination of sensor, spectrum projected field of view, and ground resolution.  Examples of radar operation modes are spotlight, stripmap, and scanSAR The schema has been defined for the User - PoC-SPS data exchange of Figure 6 and the Discover Sensors capability has been prototyped as A pplication Programming Interface API\e next step is to prototype all the capabilities as both as API and XML document interfaces Then, the XML document inte rface will be brought into compliance with the SPS Impl ementation Specification The prototyping of FireSat SysML and AGI Components interaction is taking place in geographically separated facilities: AGI in Exton, Pennsylvania and InterCAX in Atlanta, Georgia.  XML documents were exchanged by email during the initial prototyping.  Current prototyping incorporates program-to-program automatic exchange of XML documents, with all the prototyping at InterCAX Future prototyping will include an API passing of data The InterCAX approach to the design and implementation of FireSat SysML model and AGI Components interaction is addressed in reference 2 Figure 7.

   14 The schema has been defined for the FireSat SysML and AGI Components interaction of Figure 8.  The Setup System Elements and Determine Feature Coverage capabilities have been prototyped.  The next step is to prototype all the capabilities as both API and XML document interfaces 8  C ONCLUSIONS  An SPS providing a COTS GetFeasibility operation will make it easier for Users to discover sensors that fulfill their needs.  A COTS common inte rface will provide the User with one well-known set of operations for the initial discovery of candidate sensors A final selection of sensors can be carried out using the SPS operations of the individual DPs Additionally, an SPS server c ontaining a catalog of sensors can be created to provide the Users with one-stop-shopping for the initial discovery of candidate sensors The operations being developed now are for optical and radar sensors, but are extensible to Earth observation scientific sensors The design and implementation of the Magic Draw and ParaMagic FireSat SysML model interaction with AGI Components will be refined a nd then extended to other SysML tools The FireSat SysML model interaction with AGI Components proof of concept is also intended to provide the blueprint for the design and implementation of other types of SysML modeling of space based missions R EFERENCES   Docum e nt 07-014r3 at  http://www.opengeospatial.org   M a nas B a jaj, \223SLIM A C o l l a borat i v e, M odel B a sed Systems Engineering Work space for Next-Generation Complex System\224, 2011 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings, March 5-12, 2011 B IOGRAPHY  Dave Kaslow is Director, Product Data Management at Analytical Graphics, Inc.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
