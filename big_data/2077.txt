Large Size File Transfer over Wireless Environment Prodipto Das Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science Assam University, Silchar-788011 Email: prodiptodas2002@rediffmail.com Bipul Syam Purkayastha Assoc iate Professor, Department of Computer Science Assam University, Silchar-788011 Email: bipul_sh@hotmail.com Ashit Debnath Research Scholar, Department of Computer Science Assam University Silchar   AbstractIn the paper, a system known as FTWN \(File Transfer in Wireless Networks Environment\ is developed. In wireless networks, sending a large file above 100 MB is a big issue. The 
problem is solved by the system developed using JAVA. In this system FTP is used to transfer file. The transfer time is recorded and found to be very useful in wireless system Index terms-Wireless, file transfer, WLAN I  I NTRODUCTION  Wireless networking is a technology that is being increasingly implemented throughout the world. It allows the exchange of information without physically connecting wires between devices. Wireless networking hardware requires the use of an underlying technology to standardize radio frequencies as well as data transmission. The most widely 
used standard is 802.11 produced by IEEE. As a result of the technological improvement, revisions to the standard have been released. The two most common revisions that exist today are the IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g standards and use a radio frequency of 2.4 gigahertz \(GHz The IEEE 802.11b standard defines 11 Mbps and 5.5 Mbps networking transfer rates with support for the original standard 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps speeds. Whenever possible information will be transferred at 11 Mbps but will drop to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, or 1 Mbps if signal strength or interference is disrupting data transmission. The IEEE 802.11g standard increases the maximum data transfer rate to 
54 Mbps. To attain this speed, the wireless components must be closer together There are two different Wireless Networking Connection Modes   Ad-hoc mode  Infrastructure mode  Ad-hoc mode is also referred to as peer-to-peer computer-to-computer, or direct mode. Ad-hoc devices communicate directly to one another without any other devices between them In Infrastructure mode of Wireless Networking, the devices communicate through a common point that acts as a base station or hub for the wireless network. This common 
point is called a wireless access point. The wireless access point may also act as a bridge between the wireless network and a traditional wired network. Infrastructure mode wireless networks are often part of a larger network Socket Programming: A socket [1 i s o n e e n d po i n t o f a  twoway communication link between two programs running on the network. Transmission Control Protocol \(TCP\ socket connections are fundamental part of socket programming since they provide a connection oriented service with both flow control and congestion control. A TCP connection provides a reliable connection over which data can be 
transferred. To communicate over TCP, a client program and a server program establish a connection to one another. Each program binds a socket to its end of the connection. To communicate, the client and the server each reads from and writes to the socket bound to the connection. Sockets are a software methodology to connect different processes or programs on the same computer or on different computers    The Client-Server Interaction Model: The Client-Server model is the interaction between two application programs in which a program at one end \(called Client\ requests a service from a program at the other end \(called Server\ It is possible 
for the two applications to begin simultaneously, but it is impractical to require it. Therefore, it makes sense to design communicating applications to perform complementary network operations in sequence, rather than simultaneously The server executes first and waits to receive; the client executes second and sends the first network packet to the server. After initial contact, either the client or the server is capable of sending and receiving data File Transfer Protocol: File Transfer Protocol \(FTP\3  is the standard mechanism of transferring a file from one computer to another in a network. It is a client-server 
application that establishes two connections between the hosts in the network. One connection is used for the data transfer, the other for control information like commands or responses II  PROBLEM  STATEMENT Wireless communication is one of the fastest growing technologies. The demand for connecting computers without 2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications 978-0-7695-3982-9/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/ICCEA.2010.281 408 
 


cables is increasing everywhere. File Transfer Protocol \(FTP is used, which is the standard mechanism for copying a file from one host to another. Using the File Transfer Protocol as a mechanism for transferring a file from one computer to another, two connections need to be established between the two connected hosts. One connection is used for the data transfer, the other for control information \(Commands and Responses\. In this situation transferring a large multimedia file is having some issues like   i\ Low bandwidth ii\ow data rate Low bandwidth does not allow large file to send. Low data rate allow it but it will take massive time III  DESIGN The real communication of data takes place between the two communicating process \(application program\ running on the  connected computers. Process-to-process delivery of data needs two identifiers, IP address and the port number, at each end to make a connection. The combination of an IP address and a port number is called a Socket Address. It is pictorially represented in Fig. 1. The client socket address defines the client process uniquely and the server socket address defines the server process uniquely [6   When the two hosts, i.e., the client and the server in the wireless network are got connected, the corresponding communicating processes on the hosts are ready for the data transfer. For this process-to-process delivery, File Transfer Protocol \(FTP\ is used, which is the standard mechanism for copying a file from one host to another. File Transfer Protocol \(FTP\ is a client-server application [4 t h a t  establishes two connections between the hosts. One connection is used for data transfer, the other for control information \(commands and responses\. The working of FTP in the system  File Transfer in Wireless Networks Environment  is shown in figure 2 The client has three components  user interface, client control process, and the client data transfer process. User interface enables the users to interact with the system. The client control process is controlled by the local code, i.e., the client side program, and the client data transfer process is also controlled by the client side program The server has two components  the server control process and the server data transfer process. The server control process is controlled by the local code, i.e., the server side program and the server data transfer process is also controlled by the server side program of the system The control connection is made between the control processes. The data connection is made between the data transfer process. The control connection remains connected during the entire interactive session of the system. The data connection is opened and then closed for each file transferred The data connection opens each time commands that involve transferring files are used, and it closes when the file is transferred. In other words, when a user starts the system, the control connection opens. While the control connection is open, the data connection can be opened and closed multiple times if several files are transferred Communication over control connection isachieved through commands and responses. This simple method is adequate for the control connection because we send one command or response at a time. Each command or response is only one short line, such as  Send  is used for transferring a file from client to server, and  Receive  is used for transferring a file from server to client Communication over data connection is different from that of the control connection. File transfer occurs over the data connection under the control of the commands sent over the control connection. However, file transfer in the system  File Transfer In wireless Network Environment  means one of the following things  A file is to be copied from the client to the server This is termed as  Send  or  upload    A file is to be copied from the server to the client This is termed as  Receive  or  Download   The system flowchart \(fig. 3\ describes the design process in better way IV  IMPLEMENTATION Working Environment: The system has been developed under following software environment  JDK 6 \(Update 11  NetBeans IDE 6.5 Function of the Application: The basic function of the software is to transfer a large file from one node to another in a Wireless Network Environment. The system is developed in the DELL Inspiron Wireless Laptops. In this client/server application, a client can send a file or receive a file. Sending a file here means transferring a file from the client to the server, and receiving a file means transferring a file from the server to the client V  TESTING The application  FTWN  is developed and tested in Wireless Network Environment. While working in a single computer, the loop-back IP Addresses \(IP Addresses that starts with the first byte in the dotted decimal notation as 127 e.g., 127.0.0.1\re used to test the application. For testing in a wireless network \(or simply network\, the client needs to know the IP Address of the server. The application is also tested in a wired network, and it works well in the wired network environment VI  RESULTS 1  Run the server side program \(Fig. 4  409

The application will prove very useful to a vast majority of users who are habituated in using a network for their daily purpose of transferring files from one computer to another. The software package is small in size, incurs less cost and is also not time consuming The application File Transfer in Wireless Networks Environment may be extended to transfer very large multimedia files in a comparatively shorter time. The application may be extended to work on multicast or broadcast environment for transferring a file. Using this application, a client can either send \(transfer a file from client to server\ a file to the server or receive \(transfer a file 410 
 


from server to client\ a file from the server. Both the send and receive can not be done at a time. The application may be extended to such an extent so that a client can simultaneously send a file to the server and receive a file from the server REFERENCES 1  http://www.uwo.ca/its/doc/courses/notes/socket 2  http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial 3  http://www.ftpplanet.com 4  http;//www.forums.devshed.com-ftp-help-113 5  Stallings, William, Data and Computer Communications 6  Forouzan, B, Data Communications and Computer Networking   411 
 


  5 Figure 6 shows how the mission under evaluation compared to the analogy data set during the implementation phase of the mission from CDR to PSR.  As evidenced by the historical data, this mission\222s CDR-PSR duration was highly compressed relative to the other historical missions.   The average development time from CDR-PSR of the eight missions, where the detailed data was available, was 34 months.  The mission under evaluation\222s planned schedule for that same period was one-third less than the data set average at 22 months.  The schedule durations for this telescope development were planned most similar to the 223Analogy 7 mission\224, a 0.4m primary mirror telescope, of significantly less complexity 10 20 30 40 50 60 Mission Under Review Analogy 1 Analogy 2 Analogy 3 Analogy 4 Analogy 5 Analogy 6 Analogy 7 Analogy 8 Schedule Duration:  Interim Milestones \(months TRR-PSR ARR-TRR CDR-ARR Figure 6: Analogous Missions Schedul e Interim Milestone Comparison  Moreover, telescope developments have typically experienced problems at the back-end of the project lifecycle, during integration and test.   Such typical challenges in telescope developments would exacerbate any aggressive development plans.  Figure 7 shows these difficulties in terms of the magnitude of the delays that occurred in their respective developments.  The average schedule growth for these missions is 32% which should be noted is above the 22% average calculated from the previous 40 mission study 7 7 13 21 36 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 0.3 m 0.3 m 0.5 m 0.85 m 2.4 m Telescope Aperture Size \(m System Development Time \(Months Schedule Growth Initial Schedule  Figure 7: Growth of Develo pment Schedules for Telescope Missions  Although the Mission under Evaluation met the typical schedule reserve guidelines, other analyses suggest a larger schedule reserve may be more appropriate.  In essence, 1 month reserve per year of Phase B/C/D development may not be adequate for near-Earth orbiting missions.   Table 1 represents the suggested schedule reserves, respectively from a variety of different industry sources.  Notice that these guidelines, which are roughly 15% for schedule, are not sufficient to cover all potential growth  Table 1:  Summary of Aerospace Industry Schedule Reserve Guidelines  Value Source Comment 8 Industry \223Rule of Thumb\224 Equates to 1 month per year of development 15% NASA Mission Design Process Equates to 1.8 month per year of development 15% JPL Design Principles Based on JPL guidelines for an assumed four year development     
 


  6 For comparison, Figure 8 shows the actual launch delay data for the 9 missions that comp rised the analogous mission data set which identifies a median and average schedule growth of ~3.0 months/year of development \(Phase B/C/D This schedule growth shown is over and above the schedule reserve already held by the Projects.   Moreover, the schedule growth for the majority of these projects occurred during Phase C/D.   The actual schedule delays from 9 analogous missions showed an average growth of 2.7 months per year of development or 23% schedule reserves This is also consistent with the recent schedule reserves recommendation that emerged from the 40 mission data study, whereby a 24% schedule reserve \(19% at the Project level, and 5% at the Program level\erged [3  4.4 4.0 3.9 3.1 3.0 2.3 1.8 1.5 0.3 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Growth per Development Year  Figure 8:  Schedule Growth per Development Years months per year\ for 9 missions   A further analysis looked at the duration of each phase relative to the analogous data set to determine where the schedule is the most aggressive.  Figure 9 shows, on a per mission milestone basis, how the mission under evaluation compared to the analogy data se t.  The bar chart represents a percent rank function in Microsoft Excel that ranks the proposed duration relative to the data set of analogies used It provides the percent of comparable missions with development times less than the mission under evaluation In the critical CDR-PSR period, only 8% to 25% of the above mission set had durations less than the mission under evaluation  To illustrate how this schedule-risk analysis was performed an example is highlighted for the mission under evaluation A triangular distribution was developed for each element in a similar manner as for the cost-risk distribution. For each mission duration or development period, for example, ATP to PDR, or TRR to PSR, a triangular distribution was developed and assumed to determine the range of possible schedules. An optimistic \(minimum\dule, nominal or most-likely schedule \(mode\d pessimistic schedule maximum\ined for each development period For this example, the WIRE actual data at 4 months served as the low end of the triangular distribution, the most-likely or mode\was set equal to the average of all the analogy data, and the high end of 13 months was determined by the GALEX mission. Figure 10 illustrates a typical triangular distribution for the schedule development period of TRR to PSR   100.0 100.0 8.0 8.8 24.9 59.9 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 ATP-PDR PDR-CDR CDR-ARR ARR-TRR TRR-PSR PSR-Launch Percentile based on Comparable Missions Percent of Comparable Missions with Development Times Less than that of the Mission Under Evaluation  Figure 9: Analogous Mission Schedule Milestone Period Comparison

Figure 11 shows the cumulative distribution function for the PDR to launch schedule.  As shown, the project\222s baseline Phase C/D duration of 36 months, which was mandated by the rules of its competitive selection equates to a 23% likelihood of completing on time.  The analysis suggests that, to re ach a 70% confidence level for schedule, another 16 months of development time should be added  The schedule-risk analysis performed for this mission highlighted that the detailed design, integration and testing schedule \(CDR-PSR duration\was very aggressive Additionally, a review of historical data of the analogous missions examined has also revealed that actual development timelines for these periods  significantly exceeded planned development timelines.  The Launch Readiness Date \(LRD\r this mission was re-planned during the first quarter of FY08.  The mission is now planned for a launch in the second quarter of FY09, which puts the PDR to Launch duration at 52 months.   This revised LRD, which is now roughly 9 months away, is at the 70 th percentile schedule-risk confidence level  The examination of historical act ual data is informative, and provides deeper insight into typical mission development times.  Historical actual data should be considered, along with expert opinion, when developing an executable Integrated Master Schedules \(IMS  5  I MPACTS OF S CHEDULE R ISKS   One of the observations made coming out of the 40 mission study, and through additional NASA Science Mission Directorate \(SMD\alysis work, was that competitive pressures may lead to inherent optimism in early conceptual designs in order to win competed missions or start directed missions.  This optimism is inherent in the schedule as well as cost, as schedules are planned without consideration for potential developmental problems that could cause schedule delays.  This makes the need for independent schedule estimates more critical in determining the viability of a given schedule  23.3 52.4 44.9 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 Schedule Duration:  PDR to Launch \(Months Percent Likilihood of Completing on Schedule Cumulative Prob.

  8 Historically, independent schedule estimates \(ISEs\ve not been performed in conjunction with the independent cost estimate \(ICE\portant that schedules are assessed in the early conceptual design phases alongside of cost, to ascertain whether the cost-risk and schedule-risk posture, as determined through the S-curve generation, are compatible If a cost-risk curve predicts the project\222s estimate at the 65 percentile cost confidence, but the independent schedule estimate shows the project\222s schedule estimate at the 20 percent schedule confidence, this is an important insight and suggests there may be an imbalance in the project\222s early posturing, and a budget and schedule that are not compatible.  An independent schedule estimate should be performed in addition to the independent cost estimate; it is important to glean insight into the schedule risk, as schedule is a key driver of a project\222s final cost  When independent cost estimates are performed, there is an assumption that the resources are being assessed against the project\222s asserted schedule.  If this baseline schedule is not held, which is often the case, there are additional cost growth impacts that would likely occur.   A project that embarks into implementation with a non-optimal or imbalanced cost and schedule will likely have additional challenges downstream.  Ther e is always a trade-off between cost, schedule and performance, and schedule can often be \223bought back\224 at the expense of cost.  This is a trade that has been observed on the planetary missions, as they have fixed launch window constraints  The role of the schedule estimate, and the schedule risk scurve is to help provide insight into when the project will be completed, and provide input to Project Managers into the project planning  6  S UMMARY   This paper examines a multi-level quantitative schedule analysis and estimating approach similar to one that is used when evaluating proposal costs and cost risks.  Accurately predicting schedule is important in assessing project cost, as schedule is a critical driver on the overall cost.  The authors have developed a method using historical data to investigate development durations between major milestones to assess proposed schedules.  The authors have also used this tool in many proposal evaluations and independent assessments when estimating planetary and earth-orbiting mission schedules.  The method generates a schedule risk \223S-curve\224 to assess the level of confidence for a given schedule Schedule risk should be assessed early in the project lifecycle and examined in conjunction with, and for compatibility with the cost risk S-curve.   This paper has outlined the progression in schedule estimating, and the importance of equal treatment as a programmatic discipline on par with cost estimating  R EFERENCES   1  223Using Historical NASA Cost and Schedule Growth to Set Future Program and Proj ect Reserve Guidelines\224 Presented at the SCAF/SSCAG/EACE International Conference on Cost Forecasting, September 19-21 2006, Royal Institution of Naval Architects \(RINA London, UK, Bob Bitten, Debra Emmons, Claude Freaner 2  223FRISK-Formal Risk Asse ssment of System Cost Estimates,\224 Young, P.

Discussion and conclusion  6.1. Discussion of findings  The secondary data analyses in this study were able to demonstrate the cause-effect relationship between the institutional environment and e-commerce adoption.  Specifically speaking, the legal and policy environment did exert a substantial positive impact on e-commerce adoption around the world at the early stage of e-commerce \(the worldwide average score of e-commerce was only 5.51 out of 10 in the EIU 2003 sample government financial support of e-commerce and related infrastructure projects, effectiveness of legal framework, and laws covering e-commerce, together they fostered consumers and businesses in many countries to engage in e-commerce in 2003.  This finding proved the institutional perspective about the critical role of government policy and legal environment in driving e-commerce adoption Four years later, in 2007, the global average score of e-commerce improved from 5.51 to 6.37, at a rate of 16%.  As e-commerce became more prevalent in the world, supportive government policy still provided a powerful explanation for variations in e-commerce adoption around the world.  On the other hand, the impact of legal environment was reduced.  A possible explanation from the perspective of institutionalism is that a predictive and effective legal environment was important to reduce the institutional uncertainty and ensure the trust and confidence in e-commerce activities, especially during the initial stage of ecommerce development.  A good legal system is a safeguard for online commercial transactions Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal 


Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
