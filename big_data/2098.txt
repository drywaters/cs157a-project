EBC algorithm is the main part of JPEG2000 which comprises more than 50% of the computational complexity. Aiming at the shortcut of the EBC framework which is not suitable for the establishment of DSP software pipeline, a parallel framework for real-time DSP implementation of EBC algorithm is proposed in this paper. The original bitplane coding module is firstly partitioned into bit-plane scanning module and arithmetic coding module. Then the sign coding is separated from the bit-plane scanning module and implemented ahead. And the multiple loops of the bit-plane scanning module are unrolled with context combining. By these optimizations, the software pipeline of the EBC algorithm can be established which leads to an eight-time faster implementation speed  Keywords- JPEG2000  EBC algorithm; DSP; pipeline   I.  INTRODUCTION  JPEG2000 compression standard has been created to provide high compression efficiency compared to JPEG [1-2 a s a rich s e t of attracti v e f eat u r es s u c h  as progressive recovery of an image by fidelity or resolution, region of interest coding and good error resilience. However, because of its high computational complexity, real-time hardware implementation of JPEG2000 becomes a big problem when using it in deadline constrained applications. In the light of the analysis of the computation complexity for JPEG2000 Embedded Block Coding \(EBC\OT tier-1, is the most computationally intensive part which comprises more than 50% of the computational complexity [3 Recently DSP technology applied to various multimedia applications is evolved fast. The VelociTI architecture of the C6000 platform of devices make it a reality to use advanced VLIW to achieve high performance through increased instruction-level parallelism [4 i m i n g at th e sh o r tcu t o f th e EB C framework which is not suitable for the establishment of TMS320C6000 DSP software pipeline, a parallel framework for real-time DSP implementation of EBC algorithm is proposed in this paper The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 reviews EBC algorithm and analyzes the DSP implementation framework of EBC algorithm Then a parallel framework of EBC algorithm for realtime DSP implementation is proposed in section 3 Section 4 gives the experiment and simulation results We conclude the paper in section 5  II.

 Codeb loc k codin g  p asses scanning arithmetic coding Bit plane scanning Stripe scanning Column scanning Coefficients scanning  Figure 2. Diagram of EBC framework  Four processing loops exist in the realization of EBC algorithm. The framework is shown in figure 2. A code block is divided into bit planes. Each bit plane is divided into stripes. Then each stripe is divided into column. In the inner loop, each 4 coefficients are passes scanned and arithmetic coded, which needs many conditional operations in the program. Because of the multiple loops in the framework and the many conditional operations in the program, DSP software pipeline can not be established. To solve this problem we propose an improved EBC framework for parallel execution  III.  IMPROVED EBC FRAMEWORK  We improve the framework of EBC algorithm by the following steps  Separate the AC module from the BPC module  Separate the sign coding module from the BPC module  Unroll the multiple loops of the BPC module with context combining  A.  Arithmetic Coder Separation  In existing framework each bit-plane is decomposed into three passes. A bit may belong to only one of the three passes. In each pass, member bits are entropy coded. Entropy coding is performed using a particular binary arithmetic coding variant known as the MQ coder. To drive the probability models of the MQ coder, the bit-plane coder produces a context The value of the bit, or symbol, \(D\d its context \(Cx together form a context/decision \(CX/D pair  To decrease the computational complexity in the inner loop, we separate the MQ coder from the BPC module, as shown in figure 3. All the \(CX/D\airs of the samples produced by performing the three coding passes on the bit plane should be stored before putting them in the AC. The memory requirement in DSP can be calculated as 64*64*15 60 CKbyte   where 64*64 is the sample size of the code-block, 15 is the bit plane number of the code-block Codeb loc k codin g Passes scanning MQ coder Bit plane scanning Stripe scanning Column scanning Coefficients scanning  Figure 3. Diagram of EBC framework after separating the AC module  After isolating from the BPC, the MQ coder needs to be modified as follows for the purpose of DSP parallel computing  Fixed probability model During the BPC, we can record the total number of the binary symbols for each context. The probability of the binary symbols for each context can be calculated after BPC p\(0|s n\(0,s\/\(n\(0,s\+n\(1,s p\(1|s n\(1,s\/\(n\(0,s\+n\(1,s where n\(0,s\ is the total number of symbol 0 for the context s, n\(1,s\e total number of symbol 1 for the context s This improvement lets the probability model be fixed before entering in the MQ coder Therefore, the probability estimation table \(PET\ot needed in the MQ coder It can reduce the computational complexity greatly  Using multiplication In JPEG2000, the arithmetic operations of the MQ coder are simplified equations which need to switch the roles of the most probable symbol MPS and the least probable symbol \(LPS when the new interval is less than the probability. Although the coder algorithm is quite simple, it provides several challenges for efficient parallel hardware implementation In TMS320C6000 DSP, the core CPU consists of eight functional units which contain two multipliers and six arithmetic logic units \(ALU\hese eight units can execute in parallel. To pipeline the MQ coder, we use the equations with multiplications   ee ee ee AAQ AAAQ MPS MPS CCQ CCAQ AQ A AQ LPS LPS CC CC

Comparison of the existing framework of MQ coder and the modified one  B.  Bit-plane Scanning Unrolling  In the existing EBC algorithm, the DSP pipeline can not be established because of the four processing loops of the EBC framework. In bit-plane scanning, the context windows of the four samples A, B, C and D in one column are overlapped. Therefore, we can combine the 4 context windows into one overall context window, as shown in figure 5  A B C D A B B A C C B D D C  Overall context window of the sample A, B, C and D Context window of the sample A Context window of the sample B Context window of the sample C Context window of the sample D  Figure 5. Combination of the 4 context windows into one overall context window in one column  The store data types of DSP are word, halfword and byte. Before combination, the storage of the 4 context windows needs 4 halfwords. In an overall context window, 18 samples are needed for the coding of A, B C and D. Then only 1 word is needed for storage For the purpose to establish the DSP pipeline, the bit plane scanning is unrolled into column-based scanning pattern, as shown in figure 6. Figure 7 shows the improved EBC framework after unrolling the bit plane scanning   Stripe 1 Stripe 16 Column 1 Column 64 Column 1 Column 64 Column 1 Column 1024 64*64 bit-plane scanning Stripe 1 Stripe 16  1024 column-based scanning  Figure 6.

Diagram of EBC framework after unrolling the bit plane scanning  C.  Sign Coding Separation  After unrolling, the DSP pipeline still can not be established because the sign coding \(SC\ is used in Significance Propagation Pass \(SPP\ and Cleanup Pass CP\ scanning  If  SIG:0 1 SC  code  where SIG is the significant state, SC\(code\ the program for SC It is obvious that the SC is only called when the bit becomes significant. It means that each sample in the code-block needed to be SC once. Therefore, we can separate the SC from the scanning process and do it before scanning

For each sample    Ci j the sign    xi j and the contribution   di j on the p th bit plane can be calculated as   C  15 xi j i j   1\(,\0   0\(,\0     2 p p p p p Ci j di j Ci j Ci j Ci j      Then x h  x v  X h and X v can be defined as     1\\(,1\\(,1\,1 h x ij xij dij xij dij        1 1 1 1 v xij xi jdi j xi jdi j           min 1 min 1 hh h vv v Xsignx x Xsignx x    According to the values of X h and X v we can find the value of CX and x flip by looking up table I  TABLE I.

Then the process is simplified If  SIG:0 1 Read    CX D   The improved EBC framework after separating the SC is shown in figure 8. Then the DSP pipeline of the scanning implementation can be established  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  To measure the performance of the proposed EBC framework, TI TMS320C6416T device clocked at 600M is used The proposed EBC framework consists of three modules: SC, column-based scanning and MQ coder The program of these three modules is written in linear comp r pictu r es are u s ed i n t h e te s t as s h o w n in figure 9    Image1                                          Image2   Image3                                        Image4 Figure 9.

which utilize information technology successfully are typically characterized by more direct contacts between the IT and program divisions, the presence of a mechanism for program divisions to influence the IT function, and the integration of the IT and organizational strategy functions[15] Besides, Igbaria points out that the employee?s IT satisfaction is positively associated with the quality of the support by the IT department[18]. In accordance with these findings, we propose the following hypothesis  H5: The quality of Managing Information Resource Management is positively associated with the assimilation of information technology  3. 2. 4. The Nature of Task, Knowledge Type and Assimilation  Simon once pointed out that even the most sophisticated IT could be an appropriate tool only if its data requirements were met[33]. Meanwhile, Daft and MacIntosh \(1978, 1981 needs differed depending on task characteristics It is not only structure, but organizational technology itself that influences the capacity for subsequent innovations[23]. Organizational technology in turn may well be related to the characteristics of organizational tasks and task environment. Meanwhile, this technoeconomic view on organizational innovation and assimilation coincides with the organizational learning perspective on assimilation in terms of the role of existing technologies. In this vein, Fichman and Kemerer found using the sample of 608 IT organizations that assimilation of technology is related to the scale of activities over which learning costs can be spread, the level of existing knowledge related to the focal innovation, and the diversity of technical knowledge and activities[28]. Accordingly, the following hypotheses are proposed concerning the influence of organizational tasks and knowledge on assimilation of information technology  H6: The level of knowledge codification is positively associated with the assimilation of information technology H7: The routinization of daily operation is positively associated with the assimilation of information technology   Figure 1. The conceptual model of the research  G   4. Method and Results  4. 1. Methods  To test the hypotheses, we administered a survey on three departments - i.e., IS department, department of transportation administration, and department of tax administration - in 234 Korean local governments carried out during February of 2006. Questions were asked to department heads. Total number of samples was 702. The final response rate 20.0% \(197/702, IS department=70, department of transportation administration=61, and department of tax administration=66 refusals and any incomplete responses. 3  [See 


refusals and any incomplete responses. 3  [See Appendix 1  3  The unit of analysis is the department with the assimilation of in Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4   Assimilation of information technology was measured by asking respondents to rate the extent to which the use of information technology is embedded in the department?s task processes. Four questions were used to operationalize this construct Organizational culture was measured in terms of four constructs: rational culture, developed culture hierarchy culture, and group culture. SPSS 12.0 was chosen to conduct ANOVA and regression analyses Factor analyses were also performed to create independent variables such as organizational culture knowledge type, the quality of information resource management, etc.[See Appendix 2  4. 2. Results  The regression equation model of this study can be summarized as the following Organizational assimilation = ?1\(Organizational Centralization Organizational Formalization 3\(The nature of task Knowledge type 5\(Rational culture Developed culture 7\(Hierarchical culture Group culture 9\(Information resource management  Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the results of pearson?s correlation and regression analyses respectively. The nine independent variables are expected to relate dependent variables and predict them. The R2 of the regression model is 0.292 and the adjusted R2 is 0.245. To examine whether the regression model suffers from multicollinearity tolerance has been calculated. Tolerance is a method of detecting the severity of multicollinearity, where 0 stands for perfect collinearity and 1 indicates no collinearity. As seen in Table 4, there was no serious evidence of multicollinearity among the variables The Durbin Watson test of correlated error is designed to determine whether there is first order correlation in the error term. Since the DurbinWatson statistic of 1.856 is above the cut-off value there is no evidence of serial correlation in the model   Table 1.

Discussion and Conclusions  This study examined factors influencing organization assimilation of information technology in the context of Korean local governments. Of particular interests was the influence of organizational culture and types of knowledge on assimilation. The result of this study can be summarized as follows First, centralization is negatively associated with assimilation of IT. It seems that structural perspective on organizational innovation has been upheld again by this study Second, rational organizational culture is positively associated with assimilation of IT. As Debabroto et al. \(2002 assimilation of IT could be regarded as a cumulative result of actions by individuals and units within the 


result of actions by individuals and units within the organization. These actions of assimilation, in turn are stimulated or discouraged by an organizational milieu of norms, values, and rules. To the extent that assimilation of IT lies in the arena of rational choice of individuals, organizations may be able to foster assimilation by providing appropriate incentives Third, the quality of information resource management is positively associated with organizational assimilation of IT. The capacity of IT department in providing end-user support and enduser participation in IT project planning continue to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6   be important in promoting the organizational assimilation of IT   6.

managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
