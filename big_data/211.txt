Introduction E?orts to construct and reason about temporal expressions have been conducted for a long time and have become an important topic in the areas of temporal databases, problem solving, natural language understanding, and data mining. Calendar algebra has been studied for years to provide a formal speci?cation for constructing temporal expressions in terms of closely related granularities \(e.g., day, month, year organized into calendars \(e.g., 3 February, 1978 elements, especially expressiveness, e?ectiveness, and compactness, have been investigated for calendar algebra. For expressiveness, the class of calendars represented in the formalism should be large enough to be of practical use. As for e?ectiveness, algorithms to reason about di?erent time granularities should be provided in the framework. In particular, an e?ective solution should be provided to the problem of equivalence and classi?cation which concern the identity of two calendar representations and the containment of one calendar to another, respectively. Finally, temporal expressions should be described as compact as possible The research of calendar algebra can be roughly categorized into two directions, the generation of temporal granularities [4, 6, 11, 5, 8, 9, 15] and the de?nition of operations for constructing calendars [7, 20, 16, 14 Various operations have been de?ned to allow users to capture the characteristics of calendars naturally and expressively. Soo et al. proposed the uniform representation of calendar systems and tried to incorporate the idea into SQL2 [18]. A mechanism supporting the de?nition of calendars and a query language for them were developed. Three kinds of data types, event, interval and span, are de?ned in the query language. In [7 another calendar system that supports calendars in a database system with extensible relational and active features was proposed. A language was developed to support the speci?cation of a calendar, and operations like dicing and slicing were de?ned for creating desired time intervals. Other operations, such as merge, select 


time intervals. Other operations, such as merge, select and extract, were also proposed in [20]. Features about calendar operations were also studied. Ramaswamy et al. [16] used calendar algebra to select interesting time periods in which knowledge could be discovered. Three operations, always, sometimes, and temporal, were introduced to specify queries in the object-oriented context in [14]. These operations are to be used to evaluate a proposition or answer questions, e.g., whether an event always/sometimes occurs in a time period, or when a certain event holds. However, temporal requirements speci?ed by human beings tend to be ill-de?ned or uncertain. To deal with such kind of uncertain information, we borrow the fuzzy set theory [19] and propose the fuzzy calendar algebra to allow users to describe desired temporal expressions easily and natuProceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  TIME  04 1530-1311/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE rally in terms of fuzzy calendars Five operations, and, or, not, xor, and sub, are provided to help users construct and manipulate complicated fuzzy calendars. These operations re?ect the way in which people reason about temporal requirements in daily life. By using the fuzzy calendar algebra, users can de?ne complicated calendars with multiple time granularities in which di?erent time intervals can have di?erent weights according to their matching degrees to the speci?ed calendar. This can help users to discover the knowledge in the time intervals that are of interest to them. We show the usefulness of the algebra by incorporating it with an incremental data miner to mine fuzzy temporal association rules from temporal databases. Firstly, the transactions of the database are divided into a sequence of partitions. Then the weight of each partition is inferred, denoting the matching degree of the corresponding time period to the fuzzy calendar speci?ed in the user  s queries. Temporal patterns in the divided time periods of di?erent matching degrees are then e?ciently produced, and the number of database scans can be e?ectively reduced. Experimental results have shown that this approach of ?nding fuzzy temporal association rules is very e?ective The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the fuzzy calendar algebra, together with the construction of fuzzy calendars, is described. Operations for the fuzzy calendar algebra are de?ned. A formal description about fuzzy temporal association rules is given and the process of discovering fuzzy temporal association rules from temporal databases is described in Section 3. Simulation results are presented in Section 4. Finally, a conclusion is given in Section 5 2. Fuzzy Calendar Algebra A calendar is, in general, a structured collection of time intervals. Operations such as during, overlaps meets, etc., have been proposed for users to construct their own calendars [16]. However, it is hard or even impossible for users to provide a crisp description about their desired calendars. To formulate human reasoning into the process of knowledge discovery, fuzzy theory is adopted for the construction of calendars in this section. Fuzzy concepts and operations are introduced to help users express their desired calendars easily and conveniently 2.1. Basic Fuzzy Calendars To construct a calendar, the hierarchy of time granularity, e.g. week, month, and year, has to be determined to handle descriptions of multiple time granu\(a b c Figure 1. Basic fuzzy calendars associated with 


Figure 1. Basic fuzzy calendars associated with the time granularity of \(a b c larities [10]. For each time granularity, fuzzy sets which describe the distribution of all the time intervals in the time granularity can be speci?ed. Each fuzzy description of a time granularity, e.g., in the middle of a year at the very beginning of a month, or at the end of a week etc., forms a basic fuzzy calendar De?nition 1 A basic fuzzy calendar, A, characterizes a fuzzy proposition about the collection of time intervals in a time granularity U , described by a membership function  A where  A : Ti ? [0, 1 for every time interval Ti ? U . The function value  A\(Ti Some example basic fuzzy calendars are shown in Figure 1. Usually, the shapes and the number of fuzzy sets describing a time granularity are arbitrarily speci?ed by the user. Hedges such as very and more or less can also be used. With such fuzzy descriptions about time users don  t have to know the exact boundaries between interesting and non-interesting time intervals. Furthermore, the time intervals which are more important can have a larger membership degree and will contribute a bigger in?uence, which is intuitively desirable. Fuzzy calendars can also be used to describe crisp time intervals. For example, Wednesday and May can be described by fuzzy calendars with singletons, as shown in Figure 2. Temporal relations such as before and after Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  TIME  04 1530-1311/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE a b Figure 2. Singletons describing crisp time intervals, \(a b a b Figure 3. Membership functions describing the years \(a b tively can also be represented by setting membership functions to be step functions, as shown in Figure 3 2.2. Operations on Fuzzy Calendars In real life, complicated temporal expressions, such as on the weekends and at the end of a year, are required and it is important for users to easily describe these temporal requirements. We provide ?ve operations, and, or, not, xor, and sub, to help users to construct complex fuzzy calendars based on basic fuzzy calendars De?nition 2 A fuzzy calendar is de?ned recursively as follows 1. A basic fuzzy calendar is a fuzzy calendar 2. Let A and B be two fuzzy calendars. Then A and B A or B, not A, A xor B, and A sub B are also fuzzy calendars The semantics of these operations are described below De?nition 3 LetA andB be fuzzy calendars withmembership functions  A and  B, respectively 1.

A sub B denotes the subtraction of calendar B from calendar A, A?B, and  A?B  A  A    B \(5 is the resulting membership function Note that we use the algebraic sum and product, respectively, for the de?nitions of or and and, instead of max and min that are usually used. The main reason is that max and min are not satisfactory in some situations. For instance, when we take the and of two fuzzy sets, we want the larger fuzzy set to have a larger impact on the result. But if we use the min operation the larger fuzzy set will have no impact at all. Similarly, the smaller fuzzy set will have no impact on the result if max is chosen as the operation for or Consider Figure 1. Let the basic fuzzy calendars begin of a week, middle of a week, end of a week, begin of a month, middle of a month, end of a month, begin of a year, middle of a year, and end of a year be represented by bw, mw, ew, bm, mm, em, by, my, and ey, with membership functions  bw  mw  ew  bm  mm  em  by  my and  ey , respectively.

Application in Knowledge Discovery We show how fuzzy calendar algebra can be used to help discover knowledge from temporal databases. We assume that all the transactions are placed in order in a temporal database. By incorporating fuzzy calendar algebra with a data miner, called PWM, an interesting type of knowledge, called fuzzy temporal association rules, can be e?ciently discovered from temporal databases. The fuzzy temporal association rules discovered should have weighted support and con?dence greater than the user-speci?ed minimum support and con?dence, respectively 3.1. Fuzzy Temporal Association Rules Let I = {i1, i2, ..., im} be a set of items. Let D be a temporal database of transactions where each transaction t is associated with an identi?er TID, a time infor 


tion t is associated with an identi?er TID, a time information tt indicating the time when the transaction occurred, and a set of items tc such that tc ? I. Let D be divided into a sequence of n partitions, P1, P2 and Pn, each Pi containing a set of transactions occurring in the corresponding time period Ti with the duration being that of the smallest time granularity. Mining fuzzy temporal association rules in a database is to discover interesting patterns from the partitions divided in D, with corresponding time periods weighted by their matching degrees to the queried fuzzy calendar. The fuzzy temporal association rules discovered should have weighted support and con?dence greater than the user-speci?ed support and con?dence thresholds, respectively Let FC be the speci?ed fuzzy calendar, and wi be the matching degree, or weight, of the time period Ti corresponding to partition Pi in the database D where wi is calculated as in Eq.\(10 set I ? I, a transaction t is said to contain I if and only if I ? tc. Let |Pi\(I taining itemset I in partition Pi. The weighted count of an itemset I in D, denoted ?D\(I D\(I n k=1 Pk\(I  wk 11 We say that an itemset I is frequent, with respect to a support threshold of s% if D\(I n k=1 Pk  wk  s% \(12 where |Pk| denotes the number of transactions in partition Pk. The term n k=1\(|Pk  wk  s% is called the weighted count threshold of D. A fuzzy temporal association rule with respect to a fuzzy calendar, FC, is an implication of the form X ?FC Y \(13 where X ? I, Y ? I, and X ? Y = ?. As usual [1 X and Y are required to be non-empty and a rule thus contains at least two items. The association rule X?FCY is said to have weighted support s% in the database D if D\(X?Y n k=1 Pk  wk  s%. \(14 For an association rule X?FCY , let D\(X?Y X 15 The rule is said to hold in D with weighted con?dence c For a given pair of con?dence and support thresholds, c% and s%, and a given fuzzy calendar FC, the problem of mining fuzzy temporal association rules from the database D is to ?nd out all the association rules that have weighted con?dence and support greater than or equal to c% and s%, respecitvely. As usual, two subproblems are involved. The ?rst subproblem is to ?nd, with respect to FC, all frequent itemsets in D. The second subproblem is, from the set of frequent itemsets, to ?nd out all the association rules that have a weighted con?dence value greater than or equal Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  TIME  04 1530-1311/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE to c%. Given a frequent itemset I, associated rules related to I are constructed as follows. Let I be decomposed into X and Y such that X?Y = I and X?Y 


posed into X and Y such that X?Y = I and X?Y X?FCY is an association rule if ?D\(I X Since the solution to the second subproblem is straightforward [1], major research e?orts have been spent on the ?rst subproblem, i.e., ?nding frequent itemsets Therefore, our research mainly focuses on the ?rst subproblem. Given the support threshold s%, our mining system ?nds out the set L  X |X ? I??D\(X n k=1 Pk  wk  s  16 from the temporal database D. For convenience, an itemset that contains exactly k items is called a kitemset. The set of frequent k-itemsets is commonly denoted by Lk. Note that the fuzzy temporal association rules de?ned above are identical to traditional association rules if the weights of all the time periods in D are set to the same value 3.2. Mining Fuzzy Temporal Association Rules In mining a time-variant database, traditional mining methods treat transactions in di?erent time periods individually and process them with the same procedure without fully considering the time-variant characteristics of the items and transactions. Consequently some interesting rules may not be discovered. We provide a method to remedy this disadvantage. The fuzzy calendar algebra is used to describe desired temporal requirements, and then PWM \(Progressive Weighted Miner  ciation rules from a database In general, a database is too large to be held in main memory. Thus, the data mining techniques applied to very large databases have to be highly scalable for e?cient execution. By partitioning a transaction database into n partitions, P1, P2, . . . , Pn, PWM employs a progressive ?ltering scheme to generate the set of candidate itemsets for the database. One partition is considered at a time, and the cumulated information discovered in previous partitions, including a progressive candidate set of 2-itemsets, C2, their partial occurrence counts, and the corresponding partial supports required, is carried over along to the subsequent partitions. When all the partitions have been processed, the set of candidate itemsets, C, for the database can be obtained For each frequent itemset I, there must exist some partition Pk, 1 ? k ? n, such that I is frequent from partition Pk to Pn. Suppose E is a candidate 2-itemset Partition Date TID Items 1 A,C,D,E,F P1 2003/09/15 2 B,D,F Mon 4 A,B,D,E,F D P2 2003/09/16 5 A,B,C,E,F Tue 7 A,D,E,F P3 2003/09/17 8 A,B,D,F Wed Table 1. A transaction database from Pk to Pt, 1 ? k ? t ? n. Let the current partition be Pt+1. If we detect that E is not frequent from Pk to Pt+1, then E can be deleted from C2. If E is indeed frequent, it must be frequent in some later partition Pk? , k? &gt; k, and we can add it to C2 again with starting partition being Pk? . Therefore, after each partition, Pi, is processed, new partial frequent 2-itemsets 


tition, Pi, is processed, new partial frequent 2-itemsets may be added into C2, with their starting partition and partial counts being recorded. Furthermore, the old itemsets in C2 are checked if they are continually frequent from its starting partition to Pi. If a candidate 2-itemset is no longer partially frequent, this itemset is removed from C2. After all partitions have been processed, the set of candidate 2-itemsets, C2, which is close to the set of frequent 2-itemsets, is obtained Based on C2, all candidate k-itemsets, k &gt;= 3, are generated. Finally, one database scan is applied to calculate the supports of all candidate itemsets and frequent itemsets are determined. Fuzzy temporal association rules can then be formed from the discovered frequent itemsets 3.3. An Example We give an example for illustration. Consider the database D, shown in Table 1, which contains 9 transactions and is segmented into three partitions, P1, P2 and P3, each containing 3 transactions. Let the support and con?dence thresholds be 40% and 75%, respectively. Assume that the queried fuzzy calendar is the fuzzy calendar c1 given in Section 2, i.e., c1 represents \(\(in themiddle of amonth and at the end of a year or \(at the end of a week and at the beginning of a year The membership function of c1 is shown in Eq.\(6 sume that  mm  ey  ew , and  by are the membership functions shown in Figure 1 Firstly, we calculate the weights w1, w2, and w3 for partitions P1, P2, and P3, respectively.

The weighted count threshold for P1 is 0.4  3  0.67 = 0.804. The accumulative weighted count threshold for P1 is also 0.804 Among all the possible combinations of 2-itemsets in P1, only AD, AE, DE, and DF have accumulative weighted counts greater than or equal to 0.804. Therefore, these 2-itemsets, together with their accumulative weighted counts \(count starting partitions \(start

We ?nd that 5 new 2-itemsets, AB, AF , BE, BF , and EF in P2 have weighted counts greater than m2, so they are added to C2. Furthermore, the old itemsets AD, AE, DE, and DF have their accumulative weighted counts greater than 1.608. Therefore, they are retained in C2.

The itemsets generated in P1 all have accumulative weighted counts greater than 2.25 and the itemsets generated in P2, except BE, have accumulative weighted counts greater than 1.45, so they are retained in C2 and BE is deleted from C2. The resulting candidate 2-itemsets after processing P3 are shown in the right part of Table 3 Therefore, we have C2 = {AB,AD,AE,AF,BF,DE,DF,EF C3 = {ABF,ADE,ADF,AEF,DEF C4 = {ADEF Ck = ?, k ? 5 By scanning D once, we have the sets of frequent kitemsets, Lk, k ? 2, of D along with their counts to be L2 = {\(AD, 3.61 AE, 3.21 AF, 3.61 BF, 3.21 DE, 2.54 DF, 3.61 EF, 2.54 L3 = {\(ADE, 2.54 ADF, 2.94 AEF, 2.54 Lk = ?, k ? 4 and L = L2?L3. The association rules can then be obtained from the frequent itemsets in L 4. Experimental Results In this section, experimental results obtained with a PC with AMD Athlon XP CPU and 1.0G memory are presented 4.1. Experiment 1 In this experiment, we compare our fuzzy calendar algebra with the calendar algebra proposed in [16].

Performance comparison between the calendar algebra and our fuzzy calendar algebra with a simple calendar calendar algebra de?nes operators such as dicing, slicing, and ?atten to construct complex calendars. The time intervals are obtained from a speci?ed calendar and the calendric association rules are discovered in these time intervals. For a complex calendar, the calendar algebra decomposes the calendar into basic ones 


endar algebra decomposes the calendar into basic ones and then the time intervals of each basic calendar are separately searched. This approach is not e?cient since one time interval may be searched with several di?erent basic calendars. On the contrary, our fuzzy calendar algebra checks each time interval only once and can easily ?nd out all the time intervals in a given calendar. Repetitive and unnecessary searches in a time interval can be avoided, and the performance is improved We use 1825 time intervals collected in 5 years, with each time interval representing one day in a year. The execution time for ?nding out the desired time intervals by the calendar algebra and the fuzzy calendar algebra, respectively, is shown in Figure 4. The calendar algebra searches each time interval twice while the fuzzy calendar algebra searches each time interval only once, and thus we can clearly see that our method is more e?cient in interpreting calendars. For more complicated calendars, i.e., containing more basic calendars, our fuzzy calendar algebra performs even better as shown in Figure 5 4.2. Experiment 2 In this experiment, we  d like to show the e?ectiveness of our strategy for mining fuzzy temporal patterns. The number of candidates and frequent itemsets discovered are reported. The execution time for discovering the itemsets is also presented. The dataset Figure 5.

The dataset is partitioned into 200 partitions and there are 500 transactions in each partition. To infer from these partitions with our fuzzy calendar algebra, we assume the ?rst partition being the time interval of 2003/01/01, the second partition being of 2003/01/02, . . . , and so on. The calendar we are interested in is the one given in Eq.\(6 ber of candidates and frequent itemsets discovered are given in Table 4 and the execution time for discovering these itemsets is shown in Figure 6. From Table 4 and Figure 6, proper numbers of frequent itemsets can be discovered in acceptable time with our method 5. Conclusion We have presented the fuzzy calendar algebra which supports fuzzy queries on calendars.

Then the weight of each partition is inferred, denoting the matching degree of the corresponding time period to the fuzzy calendar speci?ed in the user  s queries.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
