Retrieving Task-Related Clusters from Change History Martin P Robillard and Barth  el  emy Dagenais School of Computer Science McGill University Montr  eal QC Canada f martin,bart g cs.mcgill.ca Abstract During software maintenance tasks developers often spend an important amount of effort investigating source code This effort can be reduced if tools are available to help developers navigate the source code effectively For this purpose we propose to search the change history of a software system to identify clusters of program elements related to a task We evaluated the feasibility of this idea with an extensive historical analysis of change data Our study evaluated to what extent change sets approximating tasks could have bene\002ted from knowledge about clusters of past changes A study of 3 500 change sets for seven different systems and covering a cumulative time span of close to 12 years of development shows that less than 12 of the changes could have bene\002ted from change clusters We report on our observations on the factors that in\003uence how we can use change clusters to guide program navigation 1 Introduction When involved in a task to change unfamiliar code a software developer will generally spend an important fraction of the task time investigating the code In many development environments investigating the source code can be supported in a wide variety of ways from the most basic cross-reference searches e.g for the callers of a method to advanced tools that take advantage of ever-growing quantities and types of software development data Examples of advanced tools and techniques to support software investigation include query-based source code browsers association rule mining of change history searchable project memory automated feature location 16 and topology analysis of software dependencies The rich and diverse collection of available program investigation tools and techniques is not surprising when we consider the wide variety of questions developers ask themselves during software change tasks In f act the increasing size of most software systems motivates the development of a collection of search tools that can maximize the ef\002ciency of developers in different program investigation situations In this context we investigated the usefulness of a software's revision history for facilitating software investigation To do so we devised a technique that takes as input a simple query and determines if there exists any change clusters that would match the query The concept of a change cluster has been used in the past for purposes such as analyzing the evolution of software systems In our case we de\002ne a change cluster to be a set of program elements methods or 002elds that are related through their change history Our general assumption is that a developer working on a task related to a change cluster can potentially bene\002t from knowledge about the set of elements in the cluster Given this assumption we were interested in estimating the potential value of change clusters for supporting program navigation In other words how often do tasks overlap with change clusters To what degree does the retrieval of a change cluster produce valuable information for developers These questions build on previous research in repository mining for the purpose of software engineering Others have proposed to mine software change repositories for association rules and to recommend an element for investigation if it has consistently been changed together with an element currently being modi\002ed by the developer 17 Although this idea was shown to be very good at recommending speci\002c elements in particular situations i.e systematic co-modi\002cations of the same set of elements it is too specialized to support general-purpose code investigation Instead our goal was to broaden the idea of mining association rules between sets of elements by proposing clusters of elements related through change history but that were not necessarily modi\002ed in the same change sets To investigate the value of retrieving change clusters to assist program navigation we implemented a 002ne-grained change clustering technique and applied it to the revision history of seven mature open-source systems Our study of 3 500 change sets for these systems covered a cumulative

time span of close to 12 years of development Our analysis of this data shows that less than 12 of the changes could have bene\002ted from change clusters However our analysis also allowed us to make numerous insightful observations on the factors that in\003uence how we can use change clusters to guide program navigation 2 History-Based Clusters The basic idea of task-related change clusters is to search the development history of a software project to detect groups of elements clusters that form a cohesive subset of the program This approach broadens the idea of mining association rules between sets of elements 17 by proposing clusters of elements related through change history but whose change pattern is not strictly an instance of an association rule The idea for searching for task-related clusters in revision history stems from our previous work on the reuse of program investigation knowledge for code understanding 2.1 Background Our proposed approach relies on the analysis of repositories storing the change history of software systems Such repositories typically store software changes as differences between versions of artifacts Central to our approach is the concept of a transaction or change set i.e a number of software artifacts committed together to a software repository Some repository software such as Subversion explicitly support the tracking of transactions Other systems such as CVS do not In the latter case it is nevertheless possible to convert a stream of commit operations on individual artifacts into transactions Following common practice for mining CVS repositories we consider all commits sharing a user and log message performed during a given time window to constitute a transaction The merging of branches is another issue that arises when analyzing software repositories This operation is not explicitly documented by neither CVS nor Subversion Detecting merges is important because we do not want to analyze the same change twice one in the branched version and one in the merged version As in previous work we avoid the issue of branch merging by 002ltering out large transactions see Section 2.3 Finally although commit operations are performed at the granularity of 002les a parsing operation will extract information about the individual program elements that were changed as part of a transaction Henceforth we will assume that a software repository can be abstracted as a sequence of transactions each describing the set of changed elements 002elds methods For each changed element we record whether the element was added  deleted  or modi\002ed as part of the transaction 2.2 Motivating Example We illustrate the potential bene\002ts of change clusters with a scenario taken from the change history of Apache Lucene 1 a text search engine library In October 2003 a developer starts 002xing a bug having to do with locking Transaction 1105 The modi\002cation ends up requiring the developer to commit changes to seven methods in three distinct classes and presumably to investigate a greater amount of code As it turns out the code touched is related to a highlevel locking concern and code related to this concern was modi\002ed multiple times in the past For instance more than 18 months ago a different developer had committed a very similar set of elements with the log message obtain write.lock while deleting documents Transaction 670 Very similar transactions were also committed months later by other developers 1005 1095 In fact the union of all the 24 methods committed as part of transactions 670 1005 and 1095 contains all the seven methods committed as part of 1105 and likely many methods also investigated but not modi\002ed by the developer From this example one can surmise that the ability to effortlessly retrieve the elements changed as part of the three above transactions would have been an asset to the developer But how to 002nd the set of related transactions A textual search for the word lock in all the change logs yields over 30 distinct transactions with a vast number of irrelevant elements Association rule mining would also not have yielded this result because the seven modi\002ed methods had never been modi\002ed together in the past The clustering technique we describe in the rest of this section is able to identify the three related transactions given any combination of 2 methods in transaction 1105  In our scenario having identi\002ed two relevant methods the developer would have been able to instantly view a recommendation consisting of the 22 methods in the matching change cluster 2.3 Overview of the Technique We model a program P  f e 1   e n g as a set of program elements e i  which in our case are Java 002elds and methods Our technique takes as input a query Q 022 P and returns a related cluster C 022 P  2 The idea is that Q represents a small number of elements related to a task typically 2 or 3 and that C represents a larger set of elements that are part of clusterable transactions  and that are related to the task 1 lucene.apache.org 2 In practice a cluster is a more elaborate data structure that retains the list of transactions composing it but this level of detail is super\003uous here

Given a query our technique retrieves relevant clusters in four steps 1 Determine the sequence of clusterable transactions 2 Cluster transactions 3 Retrieve the clusters matching a query 4 Filter retrieved clusters Determine the sequence of clusterable transactions Transactions that involve too few or too many changed elements to be useful are removed from the list of transactions processed by the clustering algorithm see next paragraph for thresholds The result of this step is a list of clusterable transactions  Cluster transactions The clusterable transactions are clustered based on the number of overlapping elements using a standard nearest-neighbor clustering algorithm Appendix A We used a nearest-neighbor clustering algorithm because it is a simple and intuitive way to associate elements transitively through transactions In other words if elements A and B are changed together in one transaction and then B and C are changed together in another transaction A and C might have a relation worth reporting to a developer During our initial investigation with this technique we also did not encounter any issue that would justify or motivate experimentation with different clustering algorithms The result of this clustering operation is a set of clusters representing transactions that address an overlapping set of elements The only parameter of our clustering algorithm is the minimum number of common elements between two transactions required to assemble the two transactions in a cluster Experimentation with the Lucene change history revealed 4 elements as the threshold leading to the most balanced results To produce useful clusters we remove in the 002rst step all transactions with less than four elements from the sequence of clusterable transactions as they can never be clustered Additionally based on prior experimentation we also remo v e transactions with more than 20 changed elements as these generate overly large clusters that would require developers to spend an unreasonable amount of effort to study Removing large transactions has the added side-effect of eliminating transactions representing branch merges Retrieve the clusters matching a query We return all the clusters C 2 Cj Q 022 C  Filter retrieved clusters Based on various 002ltering heuristics Section 2.4 we remove the clusters that are not likely to be useful to developers from the list of results 2.4 Filtering Heuristics The results of the search technique described above can be in\003uenced by a number of heuristics that are applied to the four steps above We experimented with a number of 002ltering heuristics that we developed based on insights gained during a preliminary study and through e xtensi v e iter ative experimentation with the change history of the Lucene system described in Section 2.2 Based on these insights we 002xed a number of parameters that clearly appeared as offering good results such as the minimum overlap value of 4 for the clustering algorithm Other heuristics required further experimentations and remained variables in our study Heuristic 1 Ignore High Frequency In step 3 queries automatically return no result if any of the query elements is an element that changed more than a speci\002ed number of times as part of a transaction We de\002ne the function highFrequency e T   boolean as returning true if element e occurs in 3 or more of the transactions in T  We designed this heuristic through prior experimentation after noticing many situations where some central or critical elements were continually modi\002ed In such cases our hypothesis is that querying the change history for the highly changed element returns too many recommendations to be useful Heuristic 2 Minimum Cohesion We de\002ne the cohesion of a cluster C created through the clustering of n transactions T i as P n i 1 j T i j j C j n  Cohesion varies between 0 and 1 and measures how much the transactions clustered actually overlap For example a cluster created from transactions grouping identical sets of changed elements would have a cohesion of 1.0 Two transactions of 5 elements of which 4 overlap would create a cluster of cohesion 5  5  6 001 2  0  83  The intuition behind this heuristic is that clusters with low cohesion may represent transactions that have been clustered but that do not represent changes associated with a common high-level concern Based on prior experimentation and on an analytic interpretation of the measure we determined that 0.6 seemed a reasonable cohesion cutoff When this heuristic is enabled in step 3 of the technique clusters are only returned if they have a minimum cohesion of 0.6 Heuristic 3 Minimum Transactions In step 3 the minimum number of transactions that must be associated with a cluster for it to be returned as a match The idea behind this last heuristic is to avoid returning results that are single transactions or very small groups of transactions which may have been spuriously clustered We experimented with values 2 and 3 A value of one returns all clusters whereas higher values produce very few recommendations

3 Empirical Assessment The overall goal of this research was to assess to what extent can we use past changes to inform program navigation This section describes the empirical setup we designed to answer that question 3.1 Research Question We re\002ne our general research goal with three speci\002c research questions Q1 Support Frequency What percentage of change tasks relate to history-based clusters Although we expect support frequency to vary across different projects we wanted to get a general estimate of the amount of historical information we can to use to produce recommendations to support ongoing maintenance Q2 Impact of Heuristics What is the impact of the 002ltering heuristics on the usefulness of the technique Q3 Value of the information To what degree are recommended clusters likely to be useful to developers 3.2 Methodology The basic methodology we employed for answering the research questions was to apply various con\002gurations of our technique to the change repositories of a number of long-lived Java systems For each system we proceeded with the following steps 1 We produced a sequence of analyzable transactions  An analyzable transaction is a transaction with three or more changes that are not additions i.e that are changed or deleted elements and with a total of 20 or fewer elements Transactions outside this range cannot be ef\002ciently analyzed with the procedure described in the following steps because newly added elements have no chance of resulting in a matching query unless they are reintroduced The list of analyzable transactions is different from the list of clusterable transactions in that analyzable transactions represent transactions to which our empirical design is applicable whereas clusterable transactions are any transactions that can be used to create clusters 2 We skip the 002rst 200 analyzable transactions to analyze transactions that approximate tasks on a system with a reasonable amount of change history We analyze the following 500 analyzable transactions in the system's change history 3 For each analyzable transaction T i for i  200  we apply the clustering algorithm of Appendix A to the set of all clusterable transactions f T j j j  i g  4 For transaction T i  we produce a set of queries Q  f  e m  e n  j  e m  e n  2 T i 002 T i  e m 6  e n  f e m  e n g  additions T i   g  In other words we consider all possible combinations of two elements in T i that do not correspond to additions Although in theory jQj  000 j T i j 2 001 can grow very big restricting our analysis to transactions with a maximum of 20 changed elements leads to a tractable number of combinations 190 We use this strategy because a maintenance task can be approached from different angles i.e different elements being selected as starting points for the investigation For example a developer might want to start with elements A and B while another developer would start by looking at elements B and C  With our strategy we exhaustively take into account all possible starting points of two elements 5 We retrieve the clusters formed by at least 2 transactions If 002ltering heuristics are enabled we apply the heuristics to remove unwanted clusters 6 We measure various properties of the output clusters We refer to the output of our technique as recommended clusters  or simply recommendations  We use four measures to assess the results of experiments as described above Measure 1 Supported Transactions The number of transactions out of 500 analyzed for a system for which at least one query generates a recommendation This measure assesses how many tasks could potentially have bene\002ted from the technique in answer to research question Q1 Measure 2 Input Coverage For transactions producing at least one recommendation the ratio of recommendations to the total number of queries for the transaction For instance a transaction with 5 elements would generate 000 5 2 001  10 queries If only 4 of these queries produce a recommendation Input Coverage  0  4  This value is aggregated over all supported transactions to produce an overall ratio This measure estimates the probability that a transaction would have bene\002ted from the technique if a developer entered a query based on the 002rst two relevant elements identi\002ed In other words if for a transaction Input Coverage  1  0  any query will produce the output cluster and hence the probability to produce a recommendation is 1 The measure of input coverage will help us assess Q1 Measure 3 Scattered Clusters The ratio of transactions for which there is at least one recommendation of a scattered cluster to the total number of supported transactions A scattered cluster is de\002ned as a cluster grouping elements in at least 3 different classes and 2 different packages generated from transactions that span at least seven days

This measure estimates the number of tasks for which recommended clusters could have been particularly useful to developers as they represent scattered and thus potentially hard to 002nd elements This measure is intended to help provide answers to questions Q2 and Q3 Measure 4 Recommendation Accuracy A measure of how accurate the recommended cluster is We estimate the accuracy of a recommended cluster by calculating the average precision and recall of each recommendation and then generating the average F-measure for all the recommendations The precision for a cluster is the number of non-query elements in the cluster that are also in the transaction analyzed divided by the number of non-query elements in the cluster The recall is the number of non-query elements in the cluster that are also in the transaction divided by the number of non-query elements in the transaction The Fmeasure is the harmonic mean of both precision and recall calculated as F  2 001 P 001 R  P  R   Our 002nal measure of recommendation accuracy is the average F measure over all recommendations In brief Recommendation Accuracy varies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 indicates that precision and recall are perfect for all recommendations and degrades according to a corresponding degradation in precision/recall as measured by the F-measure In the context of our approach it should be noted that the precision and recall ratios grossly under estimate the performance of the approach because they are calculated based on the elements changed as part of a task whereas we attempt to produce recommendations of what a developer needs to investigate  We have used the accuracy measure described above because in the absence of additional information about the change tasks it is the only way to rigorously assess our technique In practice the F-measure calculated represents an extreme lower bound on the accuracy of the approach For example a recommendation with an F-measure of 0.0 may still have been useful if it allowed the developer to 002nd related but unchanged program elements The main purpose of this measure is to provide a robust and objective way to measure the impact of the various heuristics to answer Q2 However the intermediate F-measures can also help us interpret the results for the purpose of assessing Q3 3.3 Example We clarify our experimental procedure and measures with an example Figure 1 represents a hypothetical transaction stream and some clusters and where each changed element is represented by a letter We assume that all the changed elements represent modi\002cations to existing program elements as opposed to addition of new elements or deletion of existing elements According to our de\002nitions all transactions are both analyzable and clusterable We proceed with our methodolT 1  A B C D C 1  A B C D T 2  A B E F C 2  A B C D E F T 3  G H I J C 3  G H I J T 4  A B C I Figure 1 Transaction stream and clusters ogy using a clustering

T 2  Q  f  A B    A E    A F    B E    B F    E F  g  Only  A B  retrieves cluster C 1  which is 002ltered out because it only clusters a single transaction and M IN T RANSACTIONS  2 We thus have no recommendation for T 2 as well T 3  Analyzing T 3 generates cluster C 2  Of the 6 possible queries for T 3  there is no overlap with the cluster T 3  Analyzing T 4 generates clusters C 2 and C 3  Queries  A B    A C   and  B C  all retrieve cluster C 2  which is considered a result because it represents 2 transactions We thus consider T 4 to be a supported transaction  The Input Coverage metric for T 4 is thus 3  000 4 2 001  0  5  The precision of query  A B  is jf C gj  jf C D E F gj  0  25  and the recall is jf C gj  jf C D gj  0  5  yielding F  0  33  The results are the same for the other two queries yielding a 002nal Recommendation Accuracy of 0.33 4 Results We describe our data sources and analyze the results of the experiments to answer our three research questions 4.1 Data Sources Systems were selected among the population of available and long-lived open-source Java projects To be selected for analysis a system needed to have at least 700 analyzable transactions For each system we considered all transactions starting at the 002rst transaction but removed small and large transactions as described in the previous section Table 1 reports on the systems we analyzed and their main characteristics as related to our research questions References to the systems analyzed are in Appendix B For each system the columns First and Last give the dates of the 002rst and last analyzed transactions respectively These correspond to the 201st and 700th analyzable transactions available in the repository The following column gives the number of days between the 002rst and last transactions analyzed Column Trans gives the total number of transactions committed between the 002rst and last analyzed transactions

5 Related Work There exists extensive previous work on both the mining of software repositories and on the use of clustering algorithms in software engineering This discussion focuses on the most similar and recent work in the area of software evolution Mining Software Repositories Our technique was partially inspired by the work of Zimmermann et al and Y ing et al 17 on the mining of association rules in change history As described in Section 1 we sought to expand the technique to be able to recommend larger but less precise clusters of elements to guide program navigation Bouktif et al also investigated how to recommend cochanges in software development As opposed to the work cited above Bouktif et al used change patterns instead of association rules Also their approach does not attempt to reconstruct transactions and can consider associated 002les that were changed in different transactions ChangeDistiller is a tool to classify changes in a transaction into 002ne-grained operations e.g addition of a method declaration and determines how strongly the change impacts other source code entities Our approach uses similar repository analysis techniques but is focused on providing task-related information as opposed to an overall assessment of a system's evolution Finally repository mining can also be used to detect aspects in the code In this conte xt aspects are recurring sets of changed elements that exhibit a regular structure Aspects differ from the clusters we detect in the regular structure they exhibit which may not necessarily align with the code that is investigated as part of change tasks Clustering Analysis The classical application of clustering for reverse engineering involves grouping software entities based on an analysis of various relations between pairs of entities of a given version of the system Despite its long and rich history  e xperimentation with this approach continues to this day For example Andreopoulos et al combined static and dynamic information K uhn et al used a te xtual similarity measure as the clustering relation and Christl et al used clustering to assist iterative semi-automated reverse engineering The main dif ferences b e tween most clusteringbased reverse engineering techniques and the subject of our investigation is that the entities we cluster are transactions rather than software entities in a single version of a system For this reason our analysis is based strictly on the evolving parts of the system Both Kothari et al and V an ya et al 15 recently reported on their use of clustering to study the evolution of software systems The idea of using change clusters is the same in both works and ours but the purpose of the work is different Kothari et al use change clusters to uncover the types of changes that happened e.g feature addition maintenance etc during the history of a software system Vanya et al use change clusters which they call evolutionary clusters to guide the partitioning of a system that would increase the likelihood that the parts of the system would evolve independently In contrast we cluster transactions based on overlapping elements not 002les to recommend clusters to support program navigation as opposed to architectural-level assessment of the system Finally Hassan and Holt evaluated on 002ve open source systems the performance of several methods to indicate elements that should be modi\002ed together This study found that using historical co-change information as opposed to using simple static analysis or code layout offered the best results in terms of recall and precision The authors then tried to improve the results using 002ltering heuristics and found that keeping only the most frequently cochanged entities yielded the best results As opposed to our approach the evaluated 002ltering heuristics were only applied on entities recovered using association rules and not using clustering techniques The focus of their study was also more speci\002c as they recommend program elements that were strictly changed  as opposed to recommending elements that might be inspected by developers 6 Conclusion Developers often need to discover code that has been navigated in the past We investigated to what extent we can bene\002t from change clusters to guide program navigation We de\002ned change clusters as groups of elements that were part of transactions or change sets that had elements in common Our analysis of close to 12 years of software change data for a total of seven different open-source systems revealed that less than 12 of the changes we studied could have bene\002ted from change clusters We conclude that further efforts should thus focus on maximizing the quality of the match between the current task and past transactions rather than 002nding many potential matches Our study has already helped us in this goal by providing reliable evidence of the effectiveness of some 002ltering heuristics and useful insights for the development of additional heuristics Acknowledgments The authors thank Emily Hill and Jos  e Correa for their advice on the statistical tests and the
