However, the CERS can only be found in a few big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Nanning. Thus, it is very urgent to establish a national CERS.

CERS for Chinese medium and small cities are analyzed Keywords- Coalition emergency response system; Operation mode; Authorization mode; Cooperation mode I   I NTRODUCTION  The coalition emergency response system \(CERS\s used to receive public emergency reporting and emergency call, and provide the citizens with emergency assistance, in combination with various emergency service resources. The CERS offers a strong safeguard for the urban public safety by uniform numbers, uniform command and uniform dispatch The CERS intensively coordinates various police kinds and corresponding units, and thus provides an orderly, quick and efficient reaction to the special, sudden, emergent or important accidents The public emergencies in China occur currently at a high frequency, and take a severe challenge in the long future period. Statistically, the number of casualties reaches over 
one million and economic loss is around 650 billion RMB accounting for 6% of Chinese GDP, due to the annual natural disasters, and social security accidents. However, the CERS can only be found in a few big cities such as Beijing Shanghai and Nanning. Thus, it is very urgent to establish a national CERS According to the characteristics of medium and small cities in China, the operation mode of CERS suitable for Chinese medium and small cities is provided in this paper and then the principle, framework and function design of CERS for Chinese medium and small cities are analyzed II  O PERATION MODES OF CURRENT CERS IN C HINA  There is at present no uniform classification for Chinese CERS. According to the system and relationship between the coalition emergency response center and the original 
command branches, the operation modes may be divided into four types, namely centralization mode, authorization mode proxy mode and cooperation mode. Their characteristics are listed in Table 1  TABLE 1 Comparison of Four Operation Modes of Chinese CERS Centralizat ion mode Proxy mode  Authoriza tion  mode Cooperatio n mode Characteri stic CERS center is organized invested and managed 
by government  dealing with emergency by separate branches Government authorizes command to police. Police plays a primary rule in cooperation with other branches Generally CERS consists of one government center several branch centers and remote unit centers Advantage Uniform management system and special branch are 
helpful for uniform command Little system collision; easily constructed rapidly started The relatively mature emergency system can be built by appropriate investment and reconstruction Clear functions for government and branches multi-layer command network Risk Heavy load for command center without multi-layer command network Single command is 
not helpful to exert branch activity It is slow to form a uniform command center when emergency is dealt with in the case of crossbranch cooperation Authorization needs to be complete and concrete It is difficult for information coalition due to the composing by multilayer and multi-type centers Typical city Nanning Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou Yangzhou 
 There is no basic standard for each city to apply the operation mode. Although the overseas CERS began to be built many years ago, there also exist various modes. The CERS operation mode for each city should be determined by city characteristics according to the principle of high efficiency, low cost and good effect Project supported by Youth Foundation of Hubei municipal Committee of E ducation \(Grant No:2004Q002 1

 III  O PERATION MODE AND FRAMEWORK OF CERS FOR MEDIUM AND SMALL CITIES  A  Operation Mode of CERS for Medium and Small Cities Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable The CERS of medium and small cities doesn\222t share identical characteristics with that of big cities according to much investigation as shown below 1\ely small emergency call number. For example, the daily emergency call number in Beijing or Shanghai, including 119 for fire, 110 for police, 120 for first aid and 122 for traffic etc., may reach over forty thousand However, the daily number in a medium or small city may total to only several hundred, with probably several tens of effective emergency calls 2\ow probability of heavy or tremendous disasters The CERS focuses on the common civil cases, criminal cases or some basic calls from citizens 3\all-scale city and limited finance accessible 4\ent requirement to establish the CERS According to the characteristics of medium and small cities, it is considered that the CERS of medium and small cities can not be built by copy from that of big cities. A new mode is provided in combination with authorization mode and cooperation mode according to the characteristics of medium and small cities. Based on the built physical resource, the police are authorized by the municipal government. Then the police undertake responsibility to combine various command centers and more remote terminals by network and communication facilities based on police 110, and then take task in coordination with various branches. The government communicates with various branches by emergency network and finds the emergency treatment information. In addition, all the branches can share the emergency data This mode which combines authorization mode and cooperation mode shows the advantage that it doesn\222t need much resource to establish a new CERS due to the full usage of police personnel and information resource. Upgraded from the original police command system, a new CERS is built based on police 110 command system. This new CERS integrates various separate command systems and conducts a quick response based on information sharing and intensive command. Fig.1 shows the framework for the CERS of this mode If the police want to establish a uniform command system they should integrate the existing resource, especially the 110 119 and 122 centers into one command center to deal completely with the emergency. The figure above shows that the police 110 play the key rule. Thus, it is very essential to the realization of this mode that how to build a uniform command center    Figure.1. Framework for CERS in combination with authorization mode and cooperation mode B  CERS Framework and Design for Medium and Small Cities The framework of CERS combined with authorization mode and cooperation mode is shown in Fig.2. The emergency calls of 110, 119 and 122 are accessed by telecommunication bureaus, and then be transmitted into dispatching exchangers of command center by a 2MB digital trunk. Finally the emergency calls are dispatched to dealing desk of each command center after the treatment of dispatching exchangers The 119-emergency information is automatically sent to fire brigades by this CERS. The fire emergency is sent artificially to fire brigades, and then be dealt with by fire brigades \(including the emergency record and treatment feedback\. These whole emergency data \(emergency, treatment feedback and recording files\ are stored synchronously into the database of command center. The command center can monitor and insert 119-emergency information at any moment, and dispatch other branches according to actual situation The command center dispatches the police or traffic brigades according to the location and disaster level of emergency call. The command center only takes responsibility to transmit, to record and monitor the emergency calls. In addition the command center may dispatch directly the relative personnel or branches  Figure.2. Structure of CERS combined with authorization mode and cooperation mode 2 
 


 Integrated with CTI, GIS, GPS, data security and management information system, etc, the CERS can realize the following functions 1\ Dealing with emergency 2\ributary dispatch 3\ommunication dispatch 4\ Digital recording 5\formation processing 6\ub-system functions of GIS 7\S for police vehicle IV  R OUTE CONTROL ARITHMETIC  The uniform dealing center to treat various emergency calls is the key because the telephone emergency is the primary daily emergency style. Furthermore, the efficient and orderly processing for emergency calls must depend on the Computer Telephone Integration \(CTI\nique. Combined with the hardware and software of computer network and telephone network, the CTI integrates voice service with data service After the emergency call is accessed to emergency center the CERS dispatches every call into the most suitable site by route control arithmetic. The performance of route control arithmetic affects directly the service quality of emergency center. The route control arithmetic can be divided into call queue arithmetic and call allocation arithmetic A  Route Control Arithmetic call allocation arithmetic of first come first service with weighting adjustment is applied in this system. The priority of emergency call is calculated, and then the queue order is determined by calculated priority. The field of Major and type of int for the key branch is established to denote the branch importance. The administrators set the field values by branch importance. However, here exists a problem during the dispatch that the common call can not receive service according to the rule that the key emergency call gets a priority service, if the emergency calls of key branches come continuously. To avoid this unfavorable condition above, the general consideration for emergency waiting time and priority is taken in priority calculation. The queue priority of emergency calls is determined by the following equation Time t Major t y 3 
327  327  2 1  where Y denotes the queue priority, Major representing the importance of emergency call, Time the waiting time, t1 coefficient of importance and t2 coefficient of waiting time When a new emergency call needs to insert the queue, its priority is firstly calculated by the equation above and then be inserted into the appropriate position by ordinal comparison B  Call Allocation Arithmetic The call allocation arithmetic dispatches the emergency call to the site which receives the least calls and has the longest idle interval from last call to now. The arithmetic flow is shown in Fig.3 While an emergency reporter communicates with the emergency center, the CERS searches automatically for idle sites, and defines a variable for each site. When the CERS finds only one idle site, it accesses the reporter to the site. If the CERS finds more than one idle site, two variables are defined to denote the daily received calls and the idle time respectively  Figure.3. Average allocation algorithm of the longest idle time Firstly the daily received call with the smallest number is chosen. If some sites have identical number, the site with longest idle time is then chosen to access the reporter. If there is no idle site, the reporter is told for waiting by voice prompt Thus here needs a queue. The call queue priority is determined by first come first service and first idle first service. The CERS sets a time trigger to monitor circularly the site queue V  C ONCLUSIONS  As a tremendous system engineering, the CERS involves every branch and all emergency reporters. The currently used CERS is gradually realized based on the access integrated by three networks. The CERS described in this paper are applied successfully for Hubei police systems such as the police bureau of Yingcheng city, police bureau of Jianli county police bureau of Shayang county, police bureau of Wuxue city and police bureau of Enshi city, etc. Other functions of CERS will be realized gradually in the future R EFERENCES   1  Zhang Bocheng, Tan Weixian.

 Figure 3: Segregated Features   Figure 4: Segregated Terrain For the purpose of processing orientation information from ground features, a particular feature must be separated from the others.  A region growth approach was used for this feature extraction [5][6].  The technique works very well on larger structures such as aircraft hangers or larger industrial buildings and houses that are distinct in the measured data Region growth uses a  qhull  fit to the ALS measurements and searches for connecting triangles via a Delaunay triangulation algorithm [8].  The rough extraction of the Avionics Engineering Center \(AEC Figure 5  Figure 5: Rough Feature Extraction 4 This feature is considered  rough  because it still contains some noise-like points.  While these points are actually part of the feature, they are undesirable for planar estimation and need to be removed prior to further processing.  In this case a measurement from the  crows nest  on top of the hangar was removed at the peak of the hangar as well as some points along the wall.  The cleaner feature is shown in Figure 6 and is obtained by removing points with large vertical jumps between data points using a median filter.  A median value filter can also be used to provide a more robust means of removing outliers  Figure 6: Clean AEC Hangar Extraction Plane Isolation When an individual feature has been identified, the next step is to isolate the two intersecting planar surfaces, i.e. the two sloping surfaces in a gabled roof.  Three simple techniques were evaluated to perform this task with only one yielding usable results.  The first two methods are slope-based techniques.  The first method finds the slopes by estimating the first derivatives from the points in the cloud and evaluates the sign of the slopes, whereas the second method computes all the normal vectors to the Delaunay triangles fitted to the extracted feature.  Both techniques are very sensitive to noise.  A corrugated roof would cause centimeter level variation \(i.e. noise data causing the slope-based techniques to fall apart.  The third technique looks for rising and falling trends within sequential pulses in each scan line The line-by-line technique involves separation of the data set into its constituent lines \(as measured the break point in each line.  The start point of each scan line in the extracted feature can be identified by inspection of the ALS scan angle.  Note that the feature has been extracted from a larger data set, so the scan angle no longer covers the entire swath width Each pulse within the feature is classified on a line-by-line basis into two categories: surface 1 and surface 2.  The break point is found by looking for the point with the maximum corresponding height.  The line is known to be sequential, so points before the break point would be classified as surface 1 while those after would be included in surface 2.  Data sorting in this way was chosen for two reasons.  First, real-time in-flight analysis is made possible by being able to process one line at a time.  Second physical limitations in real data \(e.g. a corrugated roof would prevent a slope based sorting technique as mentioned in the previous paragraph.  Literature contains additional techniques for more rigorous break point identification and line extraction [9].  A sample of the surface 1 / surface 2 height measurements from a single scan line is shown Figure 7  


 Figure 7: Sample Height Measurement from Scan Line In this figure, the surface 1 data points \(on the left marked with red circles while those in surface 2 \(on the right are solely black dots.  In some cases the first point or the last point might be missed due to the method of searching for the minimum or the maximum height in that line.  This effect can be observed in the breakout box of Figure 7 where the laser is likely pointed at the gutter at the base of the roof that causes a local maximum.  The peak point was excluded because the roof ridge has a cap that is not contained in either plane and could easily distort the results In general, it would be a good idea to ignore several points on each side of the line to ensure that no off-plane points are included.  This data sorting technique is very simple and works well since there will always be a height difference at the peak location.  Height measurements are very accurate and are a good metric for plane isolation Next, two planes were fitted to the separated surface 1 and surface 2 data.  The East, North, Up \(ENU all points in the surface points clouds are separated as shown in \(2  UV NEOH K KKK   2 where H = Horizontal components of position V = Vertical components of position O = N x 1 ones vector E = N x 1 vector of East surface points N = N x 1 vector of North surface points U = N x 1 vector of Vertical surface points 5 The least squares estimate of the plane parameters is performed using the pseudo-inverse according to \(3 plane parameter calculation is done once for surface 1, B1 and once for surface 2, B2, of the feature   3 To write the plane equations, the plane parameters, B  can be rewritten as a normal vector, n, and a distance vector, d as shown in \(4  1 32 1 Bd BB T  nK 4 where n = Normal Vector d = Distance from the Plane to the Origin B = Plane Parameters  Plane Intersection The technique used to calculate the intersection line involves simultaneous solution of the two plane equations for a line with one variable as a parameter.

The Xa variable is chosen so that it is certain that the intersection line will cross zero at some point.

THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE USING SYNTHESIZED FEATURES Simulation Procedure This section will describe a simulation that was developed to assess the theoretical heading accuracy possible from ALS data and a perfect synthesized feature.  The first step of the simulation was to define the scanner parameters that reflect those likely to be used in a flight test: 30 lines per second, 10,000 pulses per second, and a  30 deg field of view.  ALS angles, times, and ranges were then simulated using these parameters.  A ground feature was synthesized by replacing the simulated ranges at the correct ground positions with those calculated according to the desired feature parameters \(i.e. plane equations synthesis and plane intersection procedure described in this section is summarized in the block diagram shown in Figure 8  Figure 8: Feature Synthesis and Plane Intersection Block Diagram Table 1: Simulation Parameters Parameter Value Aircraft Altitude 350, m Points in Surface 1 127 Points in Surface 2 248 Feature Length 25.79, m Feature Width 51.12, m The synthesized feature for this paper was based on airborne measurements of the size, location, and roof slope parameters of the AEC hangar at the Ohio University Airport.  For an aircraft at ~350m altitude in the simulation the synthesized hangar would be illuminated by 127 points 


on surface 1 and 248 points on surface 2 contained within a feature footprint with dimensions of 25.79 m long x 51.12 m wide as summarized in Table 1.  The flight profile from a January 2005 flight test [7] was used to establish the aircraft position and orientation over the two second flight duration needed to extract the simulated feature.  For the data collection phase, the hangar building was over flown while collecting GPS, INS, and ALS data.  In the synthesis phase actual GPS and INS information were used, but the ALS data was replaced with simulated data so that the ALS measurement errors could be controlled.  The heading derived from the measured ALS flight data will be compared with the simulation in the next section Two existing simulators were used to generate the ALS scan angle and ranges measurements [9].  An angle simulator was used to produce an array of angles and times that correspond to the laser scanner parameters.  A range simulator was used to produce range estimates by calculating the geometric difference between the ALS height and the terrain crossing \(simulated using a Digital Terrain Elevation Data \(DTED terrain crossing was found by increasing the range until it intersected the terrain and then iterated until the height accuracy was within some threshold \(1 ?m in this case The simulated range accuracy was determined from the height accuracy using the geometric relationship described in \(15 7 cos dHdR =  \(15 where dR = Range accuracy dH = Height accuracy ALS scan angle The top subplot of Figure 9 illustrates the range accuracy threshold used by the simulator \(determined from the height error and \(15 can be seen in the bottom subplot of Figure 9 because of the range iteration technique.  A 1 ?m height accuracy \(iteration threshold sufficiently small \(i.e. approximating true range influence the standard deviation of the final simulated range measurement \(i.e. true range + sensor noise better represent the capabilities of the true ALS, 25 mm of Additive White Gaussian Noise \(AWGN range measurement as shown in the top subplot of Figure 10 following with the Gaussian distribution function shown in the bottom subplot.  The DTED accuracy was not important for this analysis since only the range measurements to the simulated feature were required for the orientation calculations.  The range to the DTED merely provides terrain measurements for height contrast in the feature extraction algorithms  Figure 9: Range Error Distribution from the Simulator   Figure 10: Range Error + Noise Distribution with 25 mm Noise The feature was synthesized by calculating its height using the planar equations for surface 1 and surface 2 of the AEC hangar roof and the illuminated ground pulse positions as shown in \(16 2 22 11   BH BH   


 Surface Surface V V 16 where V = Vertical height H = Horizontal position vector   B = Plane parameters \(Surface 1 or Surface 2 Pulses that fall within a predetermined space \(represented by white space in Figure 11 points.  The DTED terrain heights at these positions were replaced with feature heights from a feature database prior to range simulation. The synthesized feature is shown in Figure 12  Figure 11: Synthesized Feature Footprint   Figure 12: Synthesized Feature Extraction Simulation Results for Typical System Performance Once a feature has been simulated, the feature extraction and plane intersection algorithms described in the previous section are used to determine the feature orientation.  The result of the least squares plane fit is shown in Figure 13 Notice that a gap is present near the ridgeline in Figure 13 This is due to the exclusion of the actual ridge point Because the peak of the roof contains a ridge cap, inclusion of these points in surface 1 or surface 2 would distort the results.  By using the plane intersection method, these few points \(16 hundred other points would remain in the plane.  The height residuals after subtracting the plane fit are shown in Figure 14.  As expected, these height residuals reflect the same accuracy  25 mm 1 shown previously in Figure 10.  The plane residuals shown in Figure 14 can be used to measure the range accuracy directly from the data.  The next section will describe how to use this information to predict the heading accuracy 8  Figure 13: Data Point Segregation and Plane Fit   Figure 14: Plane Fit Residuals The plane parameters, 1B  and 2B  are then used to find the equation of the intersection line as is shown in Figure 15 The intersection line contains heading information for comparison with some reference data.  In this case, the reference was derived from the same range simulation without noise  Figure 15: Plane / Plane Intersection Line Multiple repetitions of the synthesized feature extraction and plane intersection algorithm were used to determine the repeatable accuracy of the technique over 5000 Monte Carlo runs as shown by the block diagram in Figure 8.  The resulting 1? heading accuracy is shown in Figure 16 for  25 mm 1? ALS range accuracy  Figure 16: Heading Accuracy for 25 mm Range Error The error performance is summarized in Table 2.  The bias term is statistically zero \(as would be expected from the zero mean AWGN added to the simulated range heading error is better than a tenth of a degree Table 2: Heading Error Summary Error Type Magnitude Heading Error Mean 4.0778 x 10-4, deg 1? Heading Standard Deviation 0.0395, deg 0.69, mrad 


1? Heading Standard Deviation 0.0395, deg 0.69, mrad Sensitivity Analysis for Varying System Performance In order to understand how the heading error varies with parameters such as laser ranging accuracy, position accuracy, and heading bias, a sensitivity analysis was conducted.  For computational efficiency the number of repetitions at each parameter setting was reduced to 1000 For each set of 1000 repetitions of the plane intersection algorithm, the one parameter was linearly increased and its affect on the heading accuracy was assessed.  The range accuracy will be considered first, whereby the simulated range noise was increase in 46 steps from 0.001m until 0.31m.  The heading error is computed by comparing the noisy simulated feature intersection with a noise-free feature intersection.  Figure 17 shows the increase in heading standard deviation as the range standard deviation increases while Figure 18 shows the rate of change of the standard deviation per unit of range noise.  Although not shown here the heading resolution bias is zero-mean up to 15 cm and increases to almost 0.6 deg for 30 cm of range noise 9  Figure 17: Heading Error Standard Deviation  Figure 18: Heading Error Standard Deviation Growth Rate per Unit of Range Noise The results shown in Figure 17 illustrate a fairly linear increase in heading error growth for small range errors \(less than 12 cm rate of error growth is constant \(~1.53 deg/m range error.  The results shown in the previous section can be directly estimated using these figures.  If a range noise standard deviation of 25 mm is multiplied by a 1.53 deg/m error growth rate, the predicted heading accuracy would be 0.668 mrad.  This predicted accuracy is approximately the same as the accuracy found from simulation summarized in Table 2 The next parameter to be considered was a constant heading bias.  For the algorithm presented in this paper, the heading bias must be consistent with the position error as would be the case for an IMU operating in a dead reckoning mode Consequently, a heading error was simulated from 0 to 2 degrees in the inertial measurements and then the ENU position was corrupted using the erroneous heading in the direction cosines matrix.  Figure 19 illustrates the residual heading resolution error bias after the simulated heading bias has been removed.  Figure 20 illustrates the standard deviation of the heading resolution error  Figure 19: Heading Resolution Error Bias as a Function of Injected Heading Bias   Figure 20: Heading Resolution Error Standard Deviation as a Function of Injected Heading Bias Up to 2 deg of injected heading bias, there is not discernable effect on the heading resolution accuracy in either the mean or the standard deviation.  This illustrates that the algorithm can detect a constant heading bias without sensitivity to its magnitude The final parameter to be considered was position noise The position noise was varied linearly from 0 to 10 cm in 48 steps.  The response of the error mean to position noise is shown in Figure 21 while the response of the error standard deviation to position noise is shown in Figure 22 10  Figure 21: Heading Resolution Error Bias as a Function of Injected Position Noise   Figure 22: Heading Resolution Error Standard 


Figure 22: Heading Resolution Error Standard Deviation as a Function of Injected Position Noise As the injected position noise increases, the heading error bias remained nearly constant at the mm-level as would be expected since the injected position noise was AWGN Similarly, the heading error standard deviation increases as the injected position noise increases.  As with the laser range noise, the position noise will also determine the heading determination standard deviation.  Inertial positions are generally low noise \(better than 1 cm source is not felt to be as significant of a contributor \(&lt; 0.04 deg As an aside, it is interesting to note that this error will increase slightly as the aircraft height increases.  This is thought to be due to the reduced number of laser pulses that comprise each plane in the intersection equation.  For example, if the aircraft height increases from 350m to 400 m, the pulse count decreases to 68 pulses in surface 1 and 141 pulses in surface 2.  The heading accuracy will decrease by approximately 0.01 degrees 5. FLIGHT TEST PROOF OF CONCEPT  Figure 23: Flight Path over AEC Hangar The flight test data was collected in January 2005 and provided ALS measurements containing several features at the Ohio University Airport including the AEC hangar [7 The flight path over the hangar is shown in Figure 23.  The ALS settings during this flight test were more optimal for this application than for mapping since the gaps between scan lines was large compared to the gap between pulses in a line.  In September 2005, a static GPS survey was conducted \(relative to the KUNI GPS Continuously Operating Reference Station the AEC hangar.  The GPS survey provided an absolute reference to compare with the ALS measurements.  The lateral measurement accuracy of this survey was thought to be on the order of  20 cm because of antenna placement uncertainty Planes were fit to the ALS data from each side of the hangar roof as described previously as shown in Figure 24.  The plane fits are shown in lighter colors \(cyan and magenta than the measured data \(blue and red  Figure 24: Two Planes fit to the Data  Figure 24 is only intended to provide an overview since the plane fit residuals contain more information as shown in Figure 25.  The plane fit residuals indicate 9 cm of height accuracy \(1 11  Figure 25: Plane Fit Residuals The resulting plane intersection line was overlaid on the ALS measurements as shown in Figure 26.  The line was a close visual match, but when comparing the calculated line with the surveyed line, slight errors can be observed  Figure 26: Line Formed by Plane Intersection A closer examination of the two lines in the horizontal plane reveals their differences in the heading as shown in Figure 27  Figure 27: Intersection Line Comparison As mentioned previously, the measured plane-fit residuals provide an indication of the heading accuracy that could be expected from the real data if the survey was perfect.  Since the flight test residuals were within the linear region of the empirical error curves shown in Figure 17, the expected heading accuracy should be predictable.  Since the measured range accuracy is 9 cm \(from the plane-ft residuals heading accuracy is expected to be 0.1377 deg \(at 1.53 


deg/m to 2.4 mrad.  This accuracy is better than the typical heading alignment accuracy of a commercial navigation grade INS The actual heading angle of the two vectors is summarized in Table 3 Table 3: Hangar Ridge Vector Comparison Heading Survey 60.9436, deg Intersection 61.8772, deg Difference 0.9336, deg 16.29, mrad The importance of this proof of concept was to demonstrate the technique and to show that the accuracy can be predicted.  In this case there are several sources of uncertainty that might explain part of the performance degradation The reference survey introduced lateral antenna placement errors of  20cm.  The antenna placement uncertainty is expected to be the dominant error source in the measured data presented here.  Over a 25 m baseline, a  20 cm placement error will become a 0.916 deg pointing error worst case prediction using flight test data Further effort is needed to make a more accurate ground feature survey, but the concept of heading determination from ALS plane intersections has been demonstrated 6. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented results that leverage the accuracy and high number of \(i.e., oversampled measurements along with a priori surveyed features to determine airborne platform heading.  Plane fitting has the affect of averaging the oversampled measurements and can deliver mrad-level heading observations.  The ALS-derived heading information shown in this paper could be used to periodically calibrate tactical grade IMU heading biases while in flight, to perform an ALS / IMU calibration prior to a terrain aided landing, or simply to stabilize the inertial heading measurements when GPS is unavailable.  A simulation was presented to show the theoretical performance of heading determination from plane intersections using typical ALS parameters.  With a perfect survey, the heading accuracy was better than 1 mrad.  Using the same simulation software, a theoretical sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of range noise, heading bias, and position noise on the heading accuracy.  The heading standard deviation was shown to be a function of the range measurement and position standard deviations.  Inertial positions are generally low noise, so this error source was not deemed to be as significant of a contributor as the range noise.  The heading error magnitude did not change the performance in a noticeable way. This theoretical performance assessment was then compared with 12 flight test data.  While the flight test performance was not as good as expected, the error sources were justified.  Even with large survey uncertainties, the heading measurement performance was still within 1 deg.  If a better survey was available, the flight test results were expected to be accurate to within a few mrad Operationally, there are many things than can be done to improve these results.  This paper discussed flight over a single building.  Accuracy can potentially be improved by flying over multiple buildings of larger sizes and at lower altitudes or other types of features.  Additionally, the heading error growth rates could be predicted by tracking the heading change while flying over a building or between two buildings.  With careful attention to calibration and measurement accuracy, these heading alignments can potentially be made at a higher accuracy than a navigation grade INS can align its heading REFERENCES 1] Schenk, T  Modeling and recovering systematic
