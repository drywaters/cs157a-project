Sieving Publishing Communities in DBLP Christoph Schommer University of Luxembourg Dept of Computer Science Laboratory for Intelligent and Adaptive Systems MINE Research Group 6 Rue Coudenhove-Kalergi L-1359 Luxembourg Email christoph.schommer@uni.lu Abstract DBLP is a bibliographic database with more than one million data entries collected from the last 70 years and labeled with diverse attributes like the authors names the publication title and the year of publishing With this as ground the motivation of applying analytical examinations to identifying publishing communities become meaningful In this respect and focusing on the idea of guring out existing associative connectivity between authors this work exposes some novel information as for example the most frequent community patterns the Donald E Ullman∫-star of 1975 and an example for a typical extreme-sized community We close with a temporal ight throughout the decades while observing the extreme-sized community and highlight perspectives and further analytical suggestions 1 Introduction DBLP  5 is a bibliographic database for scientiÆc publications in the area of Computer Science It maintains publications of authors having either published alone or with other authors DBLP is public and offers a retrieval interface to query bibliographic entries Since March 2008 more than one million entries have been added to the database having the rst publications from 1936 Furthermore an intelligent DBLP core gathers data from known conferences and collects electronic publications Understanding DBLP as a bibliographic data store and publications as transactional data referring to authors this gives the ground for a further analytical examination namely to search for associative dependencies amongst them to nd publishing communities and to track these communities over time In this regard an applicable technique is association discovery which refers to the explorative but stochastic detection of associative rules A  B  taking transactions as input The design and the implementation of association discovery algorithms to nd such associative rules in structured data sets has a long tradition One of the rst algorithms the apriori algorithm has established that bases on simple statistical calculations of frequent item sets computation and association rules generation by counting item frequencies and/or applying Bayesian probabilities Many others have followed focusing both on static data and data streams as well Since that time three parameters have established the support corresponds to the frequency the conÆdence to the Bayesian probability and the Lift to the relationship of existing conÆdence value to the statistically independent case With that we may observe how randomly an association rule is the more the Lift stands up from 1.0 the more exceptional the item B is inØuenced by item A 2 Selected Observations In this respect we have performed association analysis of DBLP entries throughout on a yearly basis for the last 72 years This is because the data set has a certain size and is therefore more expressive than a data set on a monthly basis but more precise than a less ne-granulated discretisation The calculation of association rules is done by using a sample in a way that we rstly set the item set frequency threshold to 0.1 and secondly the bayesian probability threshold to 5 Thirdly since the number of received rules is still tremendously high we lter out some of them by taking the Lift  In this respect the number of scientiÆc contributions is downsized and we get a distribution curve having the pike in 1972 Although the publication of a scientiÆc paper has a delay of a several months submission date evaluation period publication we count each scientiÆc paper to the year it has appeared Following the yearly calculation of associative rules beginning from 1936 and ending in 2007 a various number of patterns occur Additionally we observe an average authors per publication with a rst tremendous increase between 1952 and 1960 followed by a continuously exponential increase until 2007 In the meanwhile the aver978-1-4244-2917-2/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 621 


age number of authors per publication has been established to 2.5 In concern of the absolute number of publications W V Quine leads the ranking of absolute numbers of publication for almost 25 years starting with an absolute percentage of 18.9 in 1938 over 10.62 in 1945 and 5.947 in 1957 to 1.307 in 1962 He is displaced by Henry C Thacher who leads the ranking until the early 1970's Generally the Support values tremendously decrease as these values deeply depend on the total number of transactions per year On the other side the Lift values are distributed over an interval of wide range often being over 1000 For example a Lift of 1817.7 characterizes the association Itsuo Takanami  Katsuchi Inoue in 1975 a Lift of 6386.4 the association of Paola Mello  Evelina Lamma in 2005 3 Example The Donald E Ullman-star of 1975 The author's role of the left side of an association rule A  B remembers to a trigger of the publication whereas the author on the right side takes the role of an reactor  In the year of 1975 the roles of e.g Jeffrey D Ullman are typical and representative for many other authors being both a trigger and a reactor deÆning a star-structure A strong dependency is shared for example with Alfred V Aho  However Ullman is more triggered by Aho than vice versa  Alfred V Aho  Jeffrey D Ullman with a support of 0.1265 a conÆdence of 60.00 and a lift of 129.33  Jeffrey D Ullman  Alfred V Aho with a support of 0.1265 a conÆdence of 0.1265 and a lift of 129.33 Interestingly this cooperation occurs in 1995 again but with different parameter values The Lift has been exploded to 875.5 Ullman's triggering has increased by a factor nearly 200 to 25.8 and the frequency has become downsized to only a tenth  Alfred V Aho  Jeffrey D Ullman with a support of 0.021 a conÆdence of 72.10 and a lift of 875.5  Jeffrey D Ullman  Alfred V Aho with a support of 0.021 a conÆdence of 25.8 and a lift of 875.5 As we can observe in Figure 1 Ullman has published with other co-authors as well in 1975 Here the relationships to some co-authors remain one-directed since Jeffrey D Ullman is only triggered by Michael A Harrison and Stephen C Johnson  but does not trigger them by himself All other relationships are bidirectional Figure 1 The Donald E Ullman-star in 1975 with associated authors Ullman himself is both a trigger and a reactor 4 Publishing Communities As presented in Figure 2 this view of the year of 1975 proves the existence of publishing communities being either more simple or more complex In this respect a simple community is clearly arranged taking up a few authors working together For example the solely publishing of author A and author B may lead to community where only A and B belong to The higher the number of nodes and/or the higher the number of edges between them the community complexity increases However the most interesting structures are certainly those where the participating members are high but nevertheless understandable As an example the Ullman-star is convenient with this condition as it nicely clariÆes the Ullman's publishing neighborhood With noise we understand perseverative connections of power 2 being represented as a bidirectional rule owning two authors only Noise is less interesting being too small and trivial Generally only those communities are focused on that share a certain minimum activation Moreover and as mentioned above the conÆdence value reØects the strengthen of an associative connection between authors and in this respect reØexivity namely publications of only one author is not taken into account With this the situation visualized by Figure 2 mainly contains noisy communities except the communities left above makes some interest Figure 3 takes some further typical publishing communities even occurring most frequent from 1950 until today Some of them seem to be related for example a and c b 622

Figure 6 A temporal ight throughout the decades from 1960 until 2007 has been simpliÆed as never before if necessary without any external review However what has happened in the years in between The answer is quite simply as the whole publications communities grow up and change over time They must be understood as an evolutionary step with pace up and down As mentioned above the establishment of research trends is surely a motivation for big-stars referring always on the second place The breakup of big-stars are more interesting as this heralds the next research trend As for example the years of 1978 and 1993 are such ones surely referring to ArtiÆcial Intelligence and the World-wide Web services like the internet The inconclusiveness after 1994 has nally ended in 2006 Figure 7 shows publishing community dependencies of Donald E Knuth from the year of 1961 to 1990 We observe some stronger community activities with co-authors in 1961 1972 1975 and 1977 As Knuth has published many articles books and journal contributions himself without any co-author some publications are disregarded Figure 7 Facing Donald E Knuth as an active member of a publishing community 19611990 624 


6 Conclusions The vivid and colorful publication landscape enforces the scientiÆc community to a multitude of research activities nally leading to publications Additionally since the number of human researchers might is grown up the chances to electronically publish has been tremendously increased With this a description of research landscapes and especially the characterization of existing publishing communities is promising Firstly current research trends can be observed quite easily by following a big star if existing or the leading publications patterns or the search for adjacent publication be improved we better know whose contributions we need to read A step ahead is a more detailed characterization of the author's roles over the years the include of the research topic itself by adjusting an ontology and surely the conferences they have published The expressiveness of communities could become enriched and leading actors be better identiÆed Moreover the visualization of connections should regard the ConÆdence Consequently the connection becomes stronger the higher the ConÆdence is The beneÆt of such examination results and especially a temporal consideration of publishing communities can be observed for example in an additional feature towards explicit investigations like an enhanced stafÆng politics Acknowledgement This work has been done in the scope of the research project ICC which is currently performed at the MINE research group ILIAS Computer Science Laboratory A particular thank goes to Maria Biryukov References  R Agra w al T  Imielinski A Sw ami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data 1993  A Inokuchi T  W ashio K Nishimura H Motoda A F ast Algorithm for Mining Frequent Connected Subgraphs IBM Research Tokyo Research Laboratory 2002  M K uramochi G Karypis An Ef cient Algorithm for Discovering Frequent Subgraphs IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 2004 16\(9 1038-1051  M Le y  The DBLP Computer Science Bibliograph y  dblp.unitrier.de  M Le y  P  Reuther  Maintaining an Online Bi bliographical Database The Problem of Data Quality pp 5-10 EGC 2006 Lille France  P  Mika Social Netw orks and the Semantic W eb  Springer  2007  C Schommer  A T ypifying Model to Decom pose Social Bibliographic Communities CoRR abs/0809.2818  S W asserman K F aust Social Netw ork Analysis Methods and Applications Cambridge University Press 1994  X Y an J Han gSpan Graph-B ased Substructure P attern Mining Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM 2002 IEEE Computer Society 2002 721-724 625

B Highway Trafìc Density Prediction The raw trafìc data 33 w a s collected for three straight lanes and two exit lanes at site 29 located at exit 5 along the east bound direction of the Pan Island Expressway PIE in Singapore using loop detectors embedded beneath the road surface Fig 6 Data spanning a period of six days from September 5 to 10 1996 for the three straight lanes i.e lanes 1 to 3 were considered for this experiment The dataset has four input attributes representing the normalized time and the trafìc density of each of the three lanes           Fig 6 Photograph of site 29 where the trafìc data was collected The purpose of this experiment is to model the trafìc ow trend and subsequently produce predictions of the trafìc density of each lane at time t    where  5  15  30  45  60 min is the prediction time interval Three cross-validation groups CV1 CV2 and CV3 of training and test sets were used for evaluation purposes The mean squared error MSE and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefìcient R were computed for each predictions run From the example in Fig 7 we observe that the prediction accuracy decreases as the time interval  increases To evaluate the accuracy of prediction the Avg MSE indicator was computed by taking the average MSE across all 45 prediction runs 3 lanes 5 time intervals and 3 crossvalidation groups Also the Var indicator reîecting the consistency of predictions over different time intervals across the three lanes was computed by taking the change in the mean of R from  5 min to  60 min expressed as a percentage of the former This was then averaged across all three lanes to produce Avg Var The results of trafìc density prediction was compared to Hebb-RR SVM 26 RSPOP 8 POP-CRI 29 DENFIS GeSoFNN 34 and EFuNN 32 F ASCOM signiìcantly outperformed all other architectures based on the results as shown in Fig 8 with the best combination of Avg MSE  0  098  and Avg Var  19  0  as compared to other architectures The results indicates that the output prediction by FASCOM are both highly accurate and consistent over different time intervals This is desirable 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 1 2 3 4 5  Time instance Normalized density Actual  Predicted  R=0.904   MSE=0.082 a Prediction at  5 min 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 1 2 3 4 5  Time instance Normalized density Actual  Predicted  R=0.886   MSE=0.099 b Prediction at  15 min 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 1 2 3 4 5  Time instance Normalized density Actual  Predicted  R=0.873   MSE=0.108 c Prediction at  30 min 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 1 2 3 4 5  Time instance Normalized density Actual  Predicted  R=0.839   MSE=0.135 d Prediction at  45 min 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 1 2 3 4 5  Time instance Normalized density Actual  Predicted  R=0.816   MSE=0.152 e Prediction at  60 min Fig 7 Trafìc density prediction of lane 1 using CV1 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2 0.22 15 20 25 30 35 40 Avg MSE Avg Var  0  143  19  1 RSPOP POP CRI 0  189  33  2 EFuNN FA SCO M 0  098  19  0 Hebb RR 0  114  29  6 0  150  33  2 DENFIS SVM 0  120  39  6 GenSoFNN 0  164  17  4 0  167  21  9 Fig 8 FASCOM outperforms other benchmarked architectures for highway trafìc density prediction 2008 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN 2008 1521 


VI C ONCLUSIONS This paper proposed the Fuzzy Associative Conjuncted Maps FASCOM fuzzy neural network which represents information using conjuncted fuzzy sets and learns associations between them through three consecutive unsupervised and supervised phases in the learning process During the rst phase of unsupervised membership function initialization neurons are allocated to optimize information density For the supervised learning phase the single pass Hebbian learning performed is based on the memory mechanisms of synaptic plasticity forgetting and long-term facilitation Finally the nal supervised phase involves ne-tuning the network using the supervised error reduction algorithm which uses an error comparison to determine the inîuence of an input dimension across output space In the series of experiments performed we showed that each of the phases contributed to the overall performance of the architecture We were also able to demonstrate FASCOMês effectiveness in performing nonlinear data prediction on a variety of real-world problems of different natures and consisting of noisy data such as nonlinear system modeling chemical plant operation stock price forecasting and trafìc density prediction For every experiment FASCOM produced the best data prediction accuracy when benchmarked against existing architectures R EFERENCES  L A Zadeh Fuzzy logic

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%. In Fig. 4, for the column of C1, there are M*cf 1 5*80%=4 elements whose values are T \(namely, S1, S2, S3, S5 Therefore, DCAR2: course\(Cno 004 1  student\(Sno 003 1  study\(Sno, Cno\olds. From Fig. 5, we know that DCAR3 and DCAR6 also hold.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as ìfor manyî, ìthere are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logicî, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e compositionî, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
