Guirong Liu 
Abstract 
This paper describes a case study of score data analysis for the pre-warning students of a university. The analytical method includes statistical approach and data mining. Through statistical analysis for given pre-warning student score data, the present situation and trend, as well as relevant pre-warning information can be acquired. By associating technique, association rules about the 
curricula show the dependence and relationship  
I INTRODUCTION In recent years, with the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the social requirement for college students, the number of university students has constantly increased. Simultaneously, the college education quality becomes one of important issues in the college education and management. Therefore, how to ensure the quality of

education and promote the reform and development of college education is an urgent task In order to make teaching reform strategy, guide teaching practice and increase teaching quality, it is necessary to find inherent, meaningful and valuable information [1  f r o m  student-related data. These data include student profile information and score data, which can be available from a university and are accumulated every year. Data analysis for these data is helpful for understanding the college education quality. The analysis results will help discovering the hidden patterns inside these data, avoiding students to become prewarning ones This paper describes a case study of the score data analysis 
for pre-warning students. The given score data are provided by a university in China. The given datasets are transformed to a variety of data marts for objective analysis. Statistical analysis and association rule mining [2,3  ar e  u s ed in th e  d a ta an al y t i cal process II I NVOLVED DATA AND RELATED TERMINOLOGY In a university, the gained scores or credits of a student are a critical standard for student evaluation. At the time of graduation, every college student should gain credits, which should be not less than the required credits. However, if a student does not pass a course, his/her pre-warning credits increase. A pre-warning student in our selected university is 
defined as a student, whose total credits for failing courses are more than 12 credits, not including the course credits which are gained in next exams or re-selecting course\220s examinations Of course, a pre-warning student can become a normal student if his/her failing credits are less than 12 by passing the reexamination of the failing courses The analysis data are collected from four semester score data among 2005-2007. For example, the data in 2005-2006 first semester \(abbreviated to \21505-06 FS\216\ include all the prewarning students and their score data at the end of 05-06 FS The score data of the pre-warning student are collected from original data by semester, which include student No., student

3 Simultaneity, the pre-warning course datasets are extracted by semester, which include student No., course name, course credit, score, study semester. One student may have many records. These datasets are used to analyze courses incurring pre-warning credits Another student-course dataset is extracted from the prewarning course datasets, which includes student No. and all his/her pre-warning course names. One student has only one record in it. This dataset is used to analyze association rules among the pre-warning courses 1 


A Inverting rate and newly increasing rate 789 ir A nir A 39.45 29.55 B Trends of pre-warning students grouping by grade 553 of the pre-warning students are converted to the normal ones of the other semesters can be computed by the similar way. These results are described as Figure 1. In this figure, the inverting rate of \2152006-2007 Second Semester \(0607 SS\ is the highest among the given three semesters, and the newly increasing rate of the same semester declines. These results show that the pre-warning rate in 2006-2007 is well controlled The trend analysis of the pre-warning students can be carried out through grouping by grade. The courses taken as elective ones in the first semester and the second semester are different. And these courses are also of different difficulty levels. Therefore, the pre-warning rates in every semester are of different reasons.  The score data are separated according to semesters, such as 05-06 FS vs. 06-07 FS; 05-06 SS vs. 06-07 SS. A fresher is enrolled in the first semester and the senior is graduated at the end of the second semester courses in 4 semesters during 2005-2007, respectively It is interesting to find what courses are the most easily to incur pre-warning credits. The courses are ranked by the failing times. Among them, the top 20 courses in every semester are selected. That is, these courses have higher probably to become the pre-warning credits of students Among the top 20 courses, except for College English which is divided into College English Reading & Writing and College English Listening & Speaking since 2005\ there are still 11 courses incurring pre-warning credits in every Figure 2 Pre-warning rate describing by grade \(First Semester Figure 2 is the comparison of the pre-warning rate between 05-06 FS and 06-07 FS. The pre-warning rate of each grade corresponding to fresher, sophomore, junior and senior\is given. From the figure, we know that both sophomores and juniors are of higher pre-warning rate; the pre-warning rate of seniors becomes small since some of the pre-warning students may have passed the re-examination. The pre-warning rates of the four grades in both 05-06 FS and 06-07 FS have the very similar trend. Figure 3 is similar to that of Figure 2. From Figure 2 and 3, the students in the previous year have higher pre-warning rates except seniors. At the time of sophomore and junior, the pre-warning rate becomes higher since the study task is heavier in these semesters. It also tells us that college teaching and management should focus on the sophomores and juniors to reduce the pre-warning rate probably by carefully adjusting teaching plans and balancing courses. At the same time, we should pay great attention to the seniors and do the pre-warning inverting work well before graduation in order to ensure most students to graduate 39.45 40.08 23.66 29.55 31.60 23.26 20.00 25.00 30.00 35.00 40.00 45.00 05-06 SS 06-07 FS 06-07 SS 5.57 9.23 11.19 0.33 8.09 8.93 7.33 0.14 0.00 2.00 4.00 6.00 8.00 10.00 12.00 Fresher Sophomore Junior Senior PR\(05-06 FS III S TATISTICAL A NALYSIS From the above definition, inverting rate is used to evaluate how many students can convert to the normal ones by taking the re-examinations in the current semester. Newly increasing rate denotes how many students are added to the pre-warning student set. And pre-warning rate can be used to learn the failing credit outline of the enrolled students in a university If the pre-warning rate declines, the teaching quality of a university becomes better in a certain extend; On the contrary if the pre-warning rate increases, then it needs thinking about if there are problems in the teaching and management processes The objective of a university is to increase its inverting rate and decline its newly increasing rate With the given pre-warning course datasets, assume that 2152005-2006 Second Semester \(05-06 SS\ as current semester  In 2005-2006 second semester of the prewarning students are new increasing pre-warning ones The PR\(06-07 FS PR\(06-07 SS 1120 1303 706, 601, 635 A 2 A ir A nir NIR and and In the whole university, there are pre-warning students in 05-06 SS IR  55  29 1120 789 1120 In the pre-warning course datasets, there are  978-1-4244-2108-4/08/$25.00  \251 2008 IEEE 3.96 8.72 8.81 2.89 1.73 6.96 7.79 3.78 0.00 2.00 4.00 6.00 8.00 10.00 Fresher Sophomore Junior Senior Figure 3 Pre-warning rate describing by grade \(Second Semester pre-warning students in 05-06 FS and  212   212  PR\(05-06 SS  45  39 1303 789 1303 C Courses easily incurring pre-warning credits students both in 05-06 FS and 05-06 SS  Figure 1 Comparison of the inverting rate and newly increasing rate 


Then it prunes the candidates that have an infrequent sub pattern. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found Apriori rules must satisfy minimum thresholds on support and confidence at the same time [8,9   From the above section, some basic courses \(such as College English, Higher Mathematics and College Physics usually incur pre-warning credits.

Figure 4 shows the pre-warning times for each course in the 4 semesters. Higher Mathematics II \(CN1\ and College physics I \(CN6\ are the most easily ones to incur the pre-warning students.

The failing times of students in these three basic courses is about 31% of all the incurring courses \(as shown in Figure 5\, which tells us that these three basic courses are quite stable among courses incurring the pre-warning credits In Figure 6, the proportion of the students who cannot pass these basic three courses to the total pre-warning students BCR denotes this proportion\ is about 80%. It indicates that 80% pre-warning students failed in these three courses. Even the proportion in 06-07 SS declines, but it is not obvious. As these three courses are the basic courses of a university, these are to be taken as elective courses by students. Therefore students have higher probability to fail in these three basic courses. These results still show that these three basic courses are critical for college students in their pursuing bachelor degree. It also means that a university should focus on the basic courses in both teaching and management 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Figure 6 The number and porportion of the students incurring pre-warning credits of three basic courses IV M INING ASSOCIATION RULES Data Mining \(DM\s the process of digging data through sophisticated algorithms to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations that may otherwise be hidden. It has been described as \215the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data\216  and \215the science of extracting useful information from large data sets or databases\216 [5   Finding association rules in data mining is discovering interesting relationships among variables in large databases.

That is, a student failing in Higher Mathematic has students cannot pass 2 or 3 these three basic courses. These 601 0.3 0.5 73 0.12 0.8 From Table II, we find most courses have association with MCN14 \(Engineering Mechanics\. From this table, we learn that MCN2 \(College Physics\ MCN11 \(Metallography & Heat Treatment\ and MCN12 \(Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics\ppear particularly important in promoting MCN14 teaching. These rules also show that some antecedent courses are very critical to the subsequent courses in some specialties V C ONCLUSION This paper presents a score data analytical process. With statistical analysis and data mining, some hidden patterns of the pre-warning students are well uncovered. This kind of study is a well data analysis model to make use of a large amount of data in teaching and management in universities The discovered patterns or rules can be used to effectively promote education management and improve college education quality A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by Hubei Province Teaching Research Projects \(NO 20070206\, P.

However, this course ranks 2nd in School of Materials Science and Metallurgy of the selected university. In this school, there are only three specialties \(Inorganic Non-Metallic Materials Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, and Metallic Materials Engineering\ where this course is taken by students in the fourth semester. Moreover, this course ranks 1st in the incurring pre-warning courses in these three specialties With the pre-warning score data of Metallurgical Engineering Specialty, the association rules among the prewarming courses are uncovered.

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%. In Fig. 4, for the column of C1, there are M*cf 1 5*80%=4 elements whose values are T \(namely, S1, S2, S3, S5 Therefore, DCAR2: course\(Cno 004 1  student\(Sno 003 1  study\(Sno, Cno\olds. From Fig. 5, we know that DCAR3 and DCAR6 also hold.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as “for many”, “there are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logic”, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e composition”, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
