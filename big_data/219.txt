It provides another way for doing business.  This paper proposes a new algorithm, IPA \(Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules transaction patterns in the electronic commerce environment.  The IPA algorithm takes both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time to overcome the disadvantages of pure association rules mining and pure path traversal pattern mining.  The experimental results show that the IPA algorithm can simultaneously and efficiently capture the user  s traversing and purchasing behaviors 1. Introduction Today, Web has turned to be the largest information source.  Applications are ported to the Web at rapid pace.  As the electronic commerce \(EC become more and more diverse, it is very critical to provide the right information to the right customers In EC environment, how to find the association rules between purchasing items is very important.  If we provide this kind of information to the web site manager, the performance of cross-selling should be improved.  There are many researches worked on this field, e.g., Apriori algorithm [1], DHP \(Direct Hashing and Pruning  Frequent Pattern-Growth  managers may also pay attention to the navigation behaviors of customers.  Association rule mining just purely considered the purchasing behaviors of customers.  It cannot fully satisfy the managers   requirements Path traversal pattern mining is the technique that finds most of the navigation behaviors of customers in the EC environment.  The web site designer can use this information to improve the web site design, and to increase the web site performance.  Besides, this information can also provide the navigation suggestions to customers.  There are many researches worked on this field, e.g., FS \(Full Scan Selective Scan  Mining Frequent Traversal Patterns  algorithm [6, 7, 8].  However, the web site manager considers not only the pure navigation behaviors but also the purchasing behaviors of customers.  Do these purchasing items have associations?  As the result path traversal pattern mining just purely considered purchasing behaviors of customers.  It also cannot fully satisfy the managers  requirements To overcome the disadvantages of the pure association rules mining and pure path traversal pattern mining, [9] proposed an algorithm that takes both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into 


traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time.  We use an example to explain their method.  Figure 1 is an example of web transaction of a customer.  It shows the customer traverses from A to B \(buys the item 1 customer goes to C, and then goes to D.  Thereafter the customer backs to C and then goes to E \(buys item 3, 4 the item 2 at that time First, [9] cuts each web transaction into several web transaction records.  Then, MTS algorithm is used to discover the final results based on these web transaction records.  In [9], when the customer has the backward behavior, a web transaction record is generated.  Besides, if the last web page of a web transaction record does not purchase any items, it cannot be generated.  According to the Figure 1, three web transaction records are generated shown in Table 1 Because web pages D and I do not purchase any items the ABCD and ASI cannot be generated Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology for Dynamic E-Business  CEC-East  04 0-7695-2206-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Figure  1. Web transaction of a user Table 1. Web transaction records Path Purchases ABCE B{1}, C{2}, E{4}, E{3 ABFGH B{1}, H{6 ASJL S{7}, S{8}, L{9 The reason for cutting each web transaction into web transaction records is that they think the backward movement is not meaningful.  Also, it can reduce the complexity of the algorithm.  However, this assumption is not always true in all situations.  In Figure 1, it is easy to see that the customer traverse to E and purchase items 3 and 4, and then back to C and purchase item 2 at that time.  However, the web transaction records in Table 1 show that the customer buys the item 2 at C and then buys items 3 and 4 at E Therefore, the order of traversing and purchasing is not correct after dividing.  Thus, MTS algorithm cannot generate the correct results based on these web transaction records For this reason, this paper proposes a new algorithm IPA \(Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules without dividing any web transactions.  The IPA algorithm also takes both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time, and considers not only user forward traversal information but also backward information.  Besides web structure is also used in this algorithm to prune the unnecessary candidates.  Especially, the IPA algorithm allows the noise exist in web transactions The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 introduces several definitions used in this paper.  Section 3 describes our algorithm.  Before concluding, we compare our algorithm with the existing methods 2. Definitions The following shows an example of mining results lt;ABCE: B{1} ? E{4}&gt This example explains that if the customers purchase item 1 at web page B, they usually buy item 4 at web page E and the traversal path is ABCE.  Now we define the support of &lt;ABCE: B{1},E{4}&gt; is X/N N denotes the number of total customers.  X denotes the number of total customers who visit ABCE sequentially and purchase item 1 at web page B then purchase item 4 at web page E.  We also define the support of &lt;ABC: B{1}&gt; is Y/N.  N is the same as 


support of &lt;ABC: B{1}&gt; is Y/N.  N is the same as above.  Y denotes the number of total customers who visit ABC sequentially and purchase item 1 at web page B.  Based on the definition of support, we can define the confidence of &lt;ABCE: B{1} ? E{4}&gt;.  It is shown below Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology for Dynamic E-Business  CEC-East  04 0-7695-2206-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE YX      Confidence         The confidence explains that customers traverse ABC and purchase item 1 at web page B, and the probability of purchasing item 4 at web page E is X/Y Besides, a traversal sequence, e.g., ABC, is a set of web pages ordered by increasing traversal-time.  The support for a traversal sequence is the number of customers who visit this sequence sequentially divide by the number of total customers.  If the support for a traversal sequence q satisfies the user-specified minimum support, then q is called a frequent traversal sequence.  The length of a traversal sequence is the number of web pages in the sequence.  A traversal sequence of length k is called a k-traversal sequence and a frequent traversal sequence of length k is called a frequent k-traversal sequence.  Before generating the frequent traversal sequences, we need to generate the candidate traversal sequences, and scan the database to count the support for each candidate traversal sequence A candidate traversal sequence of length k is called a candidate k-traversal sequence.  Similarly, a purchase sequence, e.g., AB  C, is a set of web pages ordered by increasing traversal-time, and at least one of these web pages, e.g., B, has purchasing behaviors.  The length of a purchase sequence is the number of web pages in the sequence.  A purchase sequence of length k is called a k-purchase sequence, and a frequent purchase sequence of length k is called a frequent k- purchase sequence 3. IPA Algorithm Based on the definitions described in Section 2, the IPA \(Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules input of the IPA algorithm is the customer traversing and purchasing database, i.e., TDB, the user-specified minimum support for traversal sequence, i.e., s, and the user-specified minimum support for purchase sequence i.e., s  Because most of the users do not purchase any items in access paths, we usually set s  to s * \(t / n The t denotes the total number of web transactions which have purchasing behaviors and n denotes the total number of web transactions In IPA algorithm, CTS.k denotes the candidate k-traversal sequence, and CPS.k denotes the candidate k-purchase sequence.  The FTS.k denotes the frequent k-traversal sequence, and FPS.k denotes the frequent k-purchase sequence Algorithm IPA\(s, s  TDB Begin FTS.1, FPS.1, M CTS.1, CPS.1, s, s  TDB FTS.2, FPS.2 M, s, s   CTS.3, CPS.3 FTS.2, FPS.2 k = 3 While\(CPS.k z I begin 


begin FTS.k, FPS.k CTS.k, CPS.k, s, s  TDB TDB = TrimDB\(FTS.k, FPS.k, s, TDB CTS.\(k+1 k+1 CandidateGeneration\(FTS.k, FPS.k k end End The IPA algorithm uses the Count1 module to count the supports of CTS.1 and CPS.1 based on the TDB, and output FTS.1 and FPS.1 based on s and s  The Count1 module also constructs a two-dimensional matrix M for counting the possible CTS.2 and CPS.2.  The Scan module is used to output FTS.2 and FPS.2 based on M, s and s  The CandidateGeneration module then firstly put FTS.\(k-1 k-1 different frequent \(k-1 2-k21 S,,S,Sr, }  and ^ `t,S,,S,S 2-k21 } , a k-sequences t,S,,S,Sr, 2-k21 }  will be generated.  Finally, the CandidateGeneration module checks the subsequences of all generated k-sequences.  If a subsequence, which has a direct link in the web site structure for any two consecutive web pages of subsequence, is not frequent the k-sequence will be eliminated When CPS.k is not empty, the IPA algorithm will generate longer patterns.  FTS.k and FPS.k are generated by the CountK module based on CTS.k, CPS.k, s, s  and TDB.  The TrimDB module then is used to remove redundant records from TDB In order to clearly explain our algorithm, the following shows an example.  The web site structure is shown in Figure 2, and the customer traversing and purchasing database \(TDB Figure 2. Web site structure B D A C F E Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology for Dynamic E-Business  CEC-East  04 0-7695-2206-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE The notation  in Table 2 represents that the customer purchases on that web page Table 2.

Then, the minimum support for purchase sequence is usually set to 3/6  5/6 \(the minimum support count is 2 In this example, CTS.1 is {A, B, C, D, E, F} and CPS.1 is {C', E', F'}.  Next, we count the supports of CTS.1 and CPS.1.  After the Count1 module, we find that FTS.1 and FPS.1 are the same as CTS.1 and CPS.1, respectively In Count1 module, the support count of C is added up the original support count of C, i.e., 2, and support count of C', i.e., 3.  This is because C  includes traveling and purchasing behaviors At the same time, we construct a two-dimensional matrix M in Count1 module for counting the possible CTS.2 and CPS.2.  The results are listed below Table 3. Matrix M A B C D E F C  E  F  A 0 0 5 0 3 2 3 2 2

That is, only these 9 sequences are counted in M.  According to M and two minimum supports i.e., s and s  we can FTS.2 and FPS.2.  In this example FTS.2 is {AC, AE, BA, BE, CA, DA, DE} and FPS.2 is AC', AE', AF', BE', C'A, FC Then, CandidateGeneration module joins FTS.2 and FPS.2 into the same set, i.e., {AC, AE, BA, BE, CA, DA DE, AC', AE', AF', BE', C'A, FC'}.  For any two different frequent 2-sequences, i.e., ^ `1Sr,  and ^ `t,S1 , a 3-sequences ^ `t,Sr, 1  will be generated.  According to this way, we can generate the following 3-sequences i.e., {ACA, BAC, BAE, CAC, CAE, DAC, DAE AC'A, AF'C, BAC', BAE', BAF', CAC', CAE', CAF DAC', DAF', C'AC, C'AE, C'AC', C'AE', C'AF', F'CA After we generate these 3-sequences, we check each subsequence of these 3-sequences.  If a subsequence which has a direct link in the web site structure for any two consecutive web pages of subsequence, is not frequent, the sequence will be eliminated.  For example, DAE' will be eliminated.  This is because D and E have a direct link in the web site structure, and DE' is not frequent in FPS.2.  After this process, we output FTS.3 and FPS.3.  In this example, FTS.3 is {ACA BAC, BAE, CAC, CAE, DAC, DAE} and FPS.3 is AC'A, AF'C, BAC', BAE', BAF', CAC', CAE', CAF DAC', DAF', C'AC, C'AE, C'AC', C'AE', C'AF', F'CA After we find FTS.3 and FPS.3, we calculate the possible generation length for each transaction to trim TDB.  It is listed in Table 4.  In this example, we trim two records, i.e., IDs 3 and 6, because the possible generation lengths for these two IDs are all less than 4 Table 4.

Web Site Structure for the Real Dataset As shown in Table 5, we consider not only forward information but also backward information, and we use web site structure to prune unnecessary candidates Especially, our algorithm allows the noise exist in the transactions.  For example, suppose that a user traverses AXBC and the web site structure has a direct link between A and B.  Although AB is not successive in the access path, AB is counted in the counting procedure.  In other words, X can be seen as a noise, hence we can ignore it 4. Experimental results The following experiments use a real web transaction dataset and several simulated datasets for testing the performance of IPA algorithm.  In the real dataset, it is a networked database used to store information for renting DVD movies.  There are 82 web pages in the web site We collect the user traversing and purchasing behaviors from 02/18/2001 to 03/24/2001 \(seven days There are 428,596 log entries in the original dataset Before mining the web transaction patterns, we need to preprocess these web logs.  The steps are listed below 1. Data Arrangement: A customer's request to view a particular web page often results in several log entries since images are downloaded in addition to the HTML file.  Because we want to get a picture of the customer's behavior, the log entries about images are not important.  Thus, all log entries with filename suffix like .JPG, .GIF, .SME, .CDF are removed After this step, 53,246 log entries are reserved 2. User Identification: Next, users must be identified In this paper, we partition the log entries according to the user's IP address.  That is, we assume that each IP address is used by only one user even if different users may share the same IP address Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology for Dynamic E-Business  CEC-East  04 0-7695-2206-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 3. Session Identification: It is very possible that user visit a web site more than once.  Thus, the goal of the session identification is to identify the different visits for each user.  The method of achieving this is through time out.  That is, if the time between two requests exceed the time limit, we assume that the user start a new session According to these steps, we reorganize the original log entries into 12,157 users  traversing and purchasing sections.  In these sections, the maximum traversing and purchasing length is 27, the minimum length is 1 and the average length is 3.9.  Only 535 \(4.4 records have purchased items.  Based on this real dataset, Table 6 shows the execution time of IPA algorithm in different minimum supports for traversal sequences.  It ranges from 1.251 to 1.071 seconds Table 7 then shows the rule number generated by the IPA algorithm.  It ranges from 44 to 8 rules Table 6.

The connection probability for any two web pages is set to 30%.  The purchasing probability for a customer in a web page is set to 30%.  The maximum rule length and navigation length is set to 6 and 20, respectively.  According to these settings, we generate 200,000 users' traversing and purchasing records.  Table 8 shows the execution time of IPA algorithm in different minimum supports for traversal sequence.

patterns and to help user  s purchasing and navigation Thus, it is important to use these patterns in real world situation.  In real dataset experiments, one of the special rules is &lt;children.htm, bogustheclown.htm, children.htm thebuppetsgotolondon.htm: thebuppetsgotolondon&gt;.  According to the web structure in Figure 5, the children.htm is the genre page.  It contains links to all associated product pages.  The bogustheclown.htm and thebuppetsgotolondon.htm are all product pages They introduce the related information about the product.  Because many customers bought the product thebuppetsgotolondon bogustheclown.htm.  Thus, we can establish a dynamic hyperlink from bogustheclown.htm to thebuppetsgotolondon.htm.  This dynamic hyperlink is oriented towards the possible purchasing product according to this user behavior.  If we adopt the MTS algorithm to the same work, this rule cannot be discovered because of their assumptions for backward movements.  Obviously, our algorithm can efficiently capture the whole behaviors of users 4. Conclusions In this paper, we propose an IPA \(Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules mining web transactions in the EC \(Electronic Commerce show that our algorithm can correctly find the customer  s traversing and purchasing behaviors and outperforms MTS algorithm when they generate equal size of rules.

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
