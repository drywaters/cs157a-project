204Generally, a user will access a website with a certain interest. Mining web us ers\220 interest access patterns has been an important research direction in web usage mining. These patterns are a kind of the special 
interest association rules essentially. In this paper, we pr opose a new approach for mining

based on Hidden Markov Model \(HMM\ our approach, pages\220 contents and web server\220s log need to be preprocessed firstly. Next we presen t some definitions of users\220 access interest in a website. In addition, a new incremental algorithm Hmm_R is given to disc over the interest association rules. Finally, we report on experiments conducted with simulative and real data and then testify that the algorithm can find all interest association rules efficiently 
such rules 
I I NTRODUCTION In recently years, The World Wide Web is an immense source of data that can come either from the Web content represented by the billions of pages publicly available, or from the Web usage, represented by th e log information daily collected by all the servers around the world. Web usage mining as a branch of web data mining which aims at discovering web users\220 access patterns has become very active in academic and application dom When a user plans to access a web site, he must have a certain interest. From the other side, the designers of a website will make the web pages confirm some kind of interest classification structure Understanding the way users navigate the web helps in formulating guidelines for web site 
reorganization, in providing th e user data needed to build adaptive web sites, in making available statistics for effective placement of web advertising [2   Currently, there are some methods to discovery web users\220 navigation patterns

But the approach will flat the web site\220s structure and when there are a large numbers of web pages, the number of the index page will become overabundant. The idea of \217\217footprints\220\220

These patterns can be broadly used in analyzing paths, recommendation, and reconstructing the web site Web server log file records the properties of every access request e.g.: access time, IP address, URL or script. The aim of log preprocessing is to transform the requests submitted consecutively by users into user transactions. To be specific the steps of web server log preprocessing are Remove all the data tracked in Web logs that are

Some important keywords in a page can be extracted as a brief description of its cont ent. When a user is visiting a website, all contents in the pages he has browsed can be characterized by the keyword set extracted from these pages Specific steps of keywords extraction in a page are 
In order to extract page contents efficiently, several cleaning procedures are needed: Removing HTML XML or SGML tags; Filtering out all punctuations in contents like comma, full st op, quotation mark, etc Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under

Used-for references in the LCSH into holonym/meronym relations in our WKB  In the experiments we assume that each topic comes from an individual user We attempt to evaluate our model in an environment that covers great range of topics However it is not realistic to expect a participant to hold such great range of topics in personal interests Thus for the 50 experimental topics we assume each one coming from an individual user and learn her his personalized ontology An LIR is collected through searching the subject catalogue of Queensland University of Technology QUT Library 3 by using the title of a topic Librarians have assigned title table of content summary and a list of subjects to each information item e.g a book stored in QUT library The assigned subjects are treated as the tags in Web documents that cite the knowledge in the WKB  In order to simplify the experiments we only use the librarian summarized information title table of content and summary to represent an instance in an LIR  All these information can be downloaded from QUT's Web site and are available to the public Once the WKB and an LIR are ready an ontology is learned as described in Section 3.3.1 and personalized as in Section 3.3.2 The user con\002dence rates on the subjects are speci\002ed as in Section 3.3.3 A document d i in the training set is then generated by an instance i  and its support value is determined by support  d i   X s 2 021  i  s 2S sup  s Q  14 where s 2 S in O  Q  are as de\002ned in De\002nition 5 As sup  s Q   0 for s 2 S 000 according to Eq 11 the documents with support  d   0 go to D 000  whereas those with support  d   0 go to D   4.4 Performance Measures The performance of the experimental models are measured by three methods the precision averages at eleven standard recall levels 11SPR the mean average precision MAP and the F 1 Measure They are all based on precision and recall the modern IR evaluation methods The 11SPR is reported suitable for information gathering and is used in TREC evaluations as a performance measuring standard An 11SPR v alue is computed by summing the interpolated precisions at the speci\002ed recall cutoff and then dividing by the number of topics P N i 1 precision 025 N  025  f 0  0  0  1  0  2      1  0 g  15 N is the number of topics and 025 are the cutoff points where the precisions are interpolated At each 025 point an aver3 http://library.qut.edu.au Figure 2 Experimental 11SPR Results age precision value over N topics is calculated These average precisions then link to a curve describing the recallprecision performance The MAP is a stable and discriminating choice in information gathering evaluations and is recommended for measuring general-purpose information gathering methods The average precision for each topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each relevant document is retrieved The MAP for the 50 experimental topics is then the mean of the average precision scores of each of the individual topics in the experiments The MAP re\003ects the performance in a non-interpolated recall-precision fashion F 1 Measure is also well accepted by the information gathering community which is calculated by F 1  2 002 precision 002 recall precision  recall  16 Precision and recall are evenly weighted in F 1 Measure For each topic the macro F 1 Measure averages the precision and recall and then calculates F 1 Measure whereas the micro F 1 Measure calculates the F 1 Measure for each returned result and then averages the F 1 Measure values The greater F 1 values indicate the better performance 5 Results and Discussions The experiments attempt to evaluate our proposed model by comparing to an implementation of mental model We expect that the ONTO model can achieve at least the close performance to the TREC model The experimental 11SPR results are illustrated in Fig 2 At recall point 0.3 the TREC model slightly outperformed the ONTO model but at 0.5 and 0.6 the ONTO model achieved better results than the TREC model subtly At all other points their 11SPR results are just the same For the MAP results shown on Table 1 the ONTO model achieved 0.284 which is just 0.006 below the TREC model 2

TREC ONTO p-value Macro-FM 0.388 0.386 0.862 Micro-FM 0.356 0.355 0.896 MAP 0.290 0.284 0.484 Table 1 Other Experimental results downgrade For the average macroand microF 1 Measures also shown on Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
