  1. Introduction  The boom in the use of the Web and its exponential growth are now well known. Just the amount of textual data available is estimated to be in the order of one tear byte. In addition, other media, such as images, audio and video are also available. Thus the Web can be seen as a very large, unstructured, heterogeneous but ubiquitous database, which triggers the need for efficient tools to retrieve and filter information from this database. The general search engines are such 
tools, but could not satisfy the users information needs, since the users interests were represented only in keywords but the contents of the presented information were a list of Web pages. Without the support of a powerful tool for analyzing the huge raw data, finding the user-needed information sometimes resembles looking for a needle in a bottle of hay To help users in this task of finding their needed information, Question Answering \(QA\ systems whose main task is providing a short answer to a 
natural- query, were proposed. However, the current QA systems dont necessarily match the users individual interests and knowledge Intelligent Information Push-Pull \(IIPP Technology just is developed to solve the problems above. Push and Pull have their own merit and shortcoming, and they should learn each other Combined with artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, database and Internet, Push and Pull can help the user overcome the information overload 
Comprehensive Information Theory \(CIT\s a new way of describing knowledge, which makes use of syntactic information, semantic information and pragmatic information of data attributes. We present IIPP and CIT based Intelligent Autonomous QA System \(IAQA\, which can provide services to users under heterogeneous requirement levels and changing situation of users and providers  2. The Architecture of autonomous Question Answering system 
 Much of the classical research and development in QA system has occurred in context of centralized systems. These systems postulate a service provider who is in effect a service czar having complete control over the service aspects of the system However, it is generally agreed that implementing and maintaining the service systems is difficult As the breakthrough over the conventional systems Intelligent Autonomous Decentralized System \(IADS have been proposed by Prof. Tu Xuyan and their 
technologies have been developed 1 In IADS we must go beyond the traditional view to consider systems which have multiple autonomous points of control service. IADS is composed of Autonomous Decentralized Systems \(ADS\ and Distributed Artificial Intelligence \(DAI\e Systems Cybernetics \(LSC\ and Intelligent Management Systems \(IMS\. Three Architectures of IADS based on 


Agent are given: Union-IADS, Market- IADS and Group- IADS IADS has three design methods and two implementation techniques. Three methods are Agent-Oriented\(A/O\ethod, Generalized Modeling Method\(GMM\ and Intelligent Optimization Method\(ZOM\, while two techniques are Multi-Bases Cooperation\(MBC\ and Intelligent Information push-pull\(IIPP\ for IADS IADS based on Multi-Agent Systems \(MuAS\ and Mobile Agent Systems \(MoAS\ has not only Autonomous Controllability and Autonomous Coordinatility, but also some anthropopathic Distributed Artificial Intelligence\(DAI\ such as Activity, Mobility, Sensibility, Reactivity and Sociality A general architecture of Intelligent Autonomous QA System is shown in Fig 1  0004\000$\000\003\0000\000D\000Q\000D\000J\000H\000P\000H\000Q\000W\000\003\000$\000J\000H\000Q\000W 000\\000L\000O\000W\000U\000D\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000$\000J\000H\000Q\000W 000,\0003\000X\000O\000O\000$\000J\000H\000Q\000W 000,\0003\000X\000V\000K\000$\000J\000H\000Q\000W 0008\000V\000H\000U 000P\000R\000G\000H\000O\000V 000N\000Q\000R\000Z\000O\000H\000G\000J\000H 000E\000D\000V\000H 000&\000,\000\003\000%\000D\000V\000H 0000\000D\000F\000K\000L\000Q\000H 000/\000H\000D\000U\000Q\000L\000Q\000J 000.\000Q\000R\000Z\000O\000H\000G\000J\000H 000'\000L\000V\000F\000R\000Y\000H\000U 000,\000,\0003\0003\000$\000J\000H\000Q\000W 000\016 000&\000R\000Q\000W\000U\000R\000O\000\003\000D\000Q\000G\000\003\000&\000R\000R\000U\000G\000L\000Q\000D\000W\000H\000\003\000$\000J\000H\000Q\000W 000&\000U\000D\000Z\000O\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000$\000J\000H\000Q\000W 0005\000H\000D\000O\000\003\000:\000R\000U\000O\000G  Fig.1 A general architecture of IAQA system  The IAQA system, which uses the techniques of Multi-Bases Cooperation\(MBC\ffers a cooperation of user models base, knowledge base, CI base, IIPP is applied for providing personalized information presentation and recommendation  3. The technique of autonomous Question Answering system  Push and Pull are popular methods in question answering system. Pushing information is when users say, "I need to know this information immediately when it happens." Push is a new model for delivering information over the web. Push simply means that new information is retrieved and delivered automatically from a remote computer to the users PC.  It is helpful to the user mining the valuable information efficiently Pulling information is when users say, "I want to have access to this information when I decide to go get it." The "puller" just needs to know where it is stored and uses the Web to send a query and gets the needed information To improve the efficiency of acquiring the useful information from the Internet and database, enlarge the capability of the Internet and database offering the active and personalized information service, we combine the artificial intelligence with knowledge engineering and database to develop a technology of IIPP-Intelligent Information push-pull 3 see Fig.2  000,\000Q\000W\000H\000O\000O\000L\000J\000H\000Q\000W\000\003\000L\000Q\000I\000R\000U\000P\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q 000S\000X\000V\000K\000\020\000S\000X\000O\000O 000L\000Q\000I\000R\000U\000P\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003\000S\000X\000V\000K\000L\000Q\000J\000\017 000L\000Q\000I\000R\000U\000P\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003\000S\000X\000O\000O\000L\000Q\000J 000P\000D\000F\000K\000L\000Q\000H\000\003\000O\000H\000D\000U\000Q\000L\000Q\000J\000\017 000N\000Q\000R\000Z\000Q\000O\000H\000G\000J\000H\000\003\000G\000L\000V\000F\000R\000Y\000H\000U\000L\000Q\000J 000D\000U\000W\000L\000I\000L\000F\000L\000D\000O 000L\000Q\000W\000H\000O\000O\000L\000J\000H\000Q\000F\000H\000\017 000N\000Q\000R\000Z\000O\000H\000G\000J\000H\000\003\000H\000Q\000J\000L\000Q\000H\000H\000U\000L\000Q\000J 000,\000Q\000W\000H\000U\000Q\000H\000W\000\017\000\003\000G\000D\000W\000D\000E\000D\000V\000H Fig.2 the Framework of the IIPP  3.1. IPushAgent  Through the association rules, standard technique and user model, Intelligent Information Push is an automatic mechanism for getting information that statifies the users perspective from the web, and regularly transferring the information by Web page or email to the user. The structure of the IPushAgent is IPush Agent MAgent     //Management Agent DFAgent    //Directory Facilitator Agent WCAgent    // Web Crawling Agent ARMAgent  //Association Rules Mining Agent IRAgent      // Information Retrieval Agent IPAgent      //Information Push Agent RM         //Resource Management Task Coordination MTS         //Message Transport System  IPush Agent can automatically search the topic information that users concern and transfer it to the users at the time and spot the user preference after selection, classification and ranking, according to the users request including the users personal archives information topic and research direction, etc Intelligent Information Push Technology realizes the professional and intelligent network topic information 


service in the Internet/Intranet environment, and it will become the technology base of personalized knowledge service in the future. Intelligent Information Push Technology switches the search mode from people search information to information search people, sends information to people by email, channels pushing and Web ordering  3.2. IPullAgent  Intelligent Information Pull is a multi-agent system IPull Agent decomposes the users query task generates query term, then searches the user-concerned information efficiently, accurately and feedback it to the user The structure of IPull Agent is IPull Agent MAgent     //Management Agent DFAgent     //Directory Facilitator Agent PGAgent    // Question Parsing Agent REAgent    //Result Extraction Agent IRAgent     // Information Retrieval Agent IPAgent     //reasoning Agent RM        //Resource Management Task Coordination MTS      //Message Transport System  IPull Agent provides the direct answers to user questions by consulting its knowledge base. Combined with information retrieval \(IR\ and NLP techniques IPull Agent has the potential to answer questions of a wide variety of topics from huge documents collection e.g., the web itself IPull Agent lies on the top of documents collection and handles retrieval requests. In the context of web this is a search engine that indexes web pages analyzes these documents and extracts answers from them  3.3. IIPPAgent  The IAQA system is an information service system that recommends the selected information by users interest, concern and preference. It requires the system be able to track the users daily browsing and the searching, deduce the information user need and recommend the new information Association rules identify collections of data attributes that are statistically related in the underlying data 6 An association rule is of the form X  Y  where X and Y are disjoint conjunctions of attributevalue pairs. The confidence of the rule is the conditional probability of Y given X Pr Y  X and the support of the rule is the prior probability of X and Y  Pr X and Y Here probability is taken to be the observed frequency in the data set. The traditional association rule mining problem can be described as follows. Given a database of transactions, a minimal confidence threshold and a minimal support threshold find all association rules whose confidence and support are above the corresponding thresholds Topic-based Association Rules Mining will apply the CIT for finding all association rules and a new criterion, which makes use of syntactic information semantic information and pragmatic information of data attributes The Comprehensive Information provided by an object and perceived by a subject is defined as a trinity the form, the meaning, and the value all related to the objects states and the manner of the states varying. So CI is a name for the entirety of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information of the object concerned \(see Fig.3            Fig.3 Model of comprehensive information  As we can see from Fig.3, the states of objects can be represented by sequence of symbols. Relation among them can demonstrate the manner of states varying, so they are the formalized syntactic information of objects. When symbols are used to refer to realistic object, the syntactic information is endowed with true meaning, which is semantic information. And when these two kinds of information are related with specific human users \(subjects\, they will exhibit certain value, or utility, to the users goal, which is pragmatic information The characteristic of CIT makes it especially fit for our IAQA system, since in the case of personalized recommendation syntactic information concerns if a user utterance can be parsed. Semantic information concerns if the utterances meaning is true in logic Pragmatic information describes if the user utterance is related with the previous system utterance For any given object 000^\000 n x x x X    2 1 000\026 000 three kinds of descriptive parameters are introduced, named Syntactic Information   Meaning                     Value    Semantic                        Pragmatic Information                     Information Object State Symbol  Subject  


the certainty denoted by 000^\000 n c c c C    2 1 000\026 000 the logical truth denoted by 000^\000 n t t t T    2 1 000\026 000 and the utility denoted by 000^\000 n u u u U    2 1 000\026 000 CI can thus be described by using a matrix n n n n u u u t t t c c c x x x 000\026 000\026 000\026 000\026 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1  Based on Eq.\(1\, the amount of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information as well as CI can all be derived 3    4. An Application   The information service system for the rural area and society development resource is an application of IIPP and CIT based Intelligent Autonomous QA System \(see Fig.1\, including Crawling Agent discovering, collecting the web pages from the Website automatically with the support of a high performance spider \(or robot\awler acts like hyper-caffeinated web browsers. Seeded with a set of URLs, it downloads Web pages, then: extracts all links on every page for further Crawling; finally hands the pages off to the indexer Filtering Agent filtering for MBC  index is established from the retrieved Web information, in which inverted files is generally used. An inverted file is a word-oriented mechanism for indexing a text collection IPullAgent The system performs the personalized information retrieval and information push-pull with the users interests to achieve high-speed, high-precise personalized information service IPushAgent The popular key-word based retrieval technology retrieves information from the Web according to user keywords and their logic relation and then returns the relative information to the users. It only concentrates the syntactic information and ignores the semantic information, causing much useless information retrieved. In addition, several keywords are unable to express the users query, especially for the low-educated peasants for their query usually is in some colloquial style. In order to make the computer understand the users request and improve the retrieval efficiency, we apply the natural language processing technique into the system QA Management Agent A friendly, simple and easy-using interface is very important to the main users of the system-people in the rural area. The use interface of the system can acquires users input display retrieval results, provides feedbacks, which take the user favorites into consideration carefully  5. Conclusion   Based on the combination of IIPP and CIT, the Intelligent Autonomous QA System is proposed and developed, which helps user cope efficiently with the rapidly evolving widespread growth of the Internet. In this paper, IAQA systems architecture and performance are given. Some methods and techniques for design and implementation of IAQA system are introduced. IAQA system is more effective as the value-addition to the users information service system which is built under the open and standard technologies  References   u Xuy a n Ta n g T a o.

Empirical Section This part is to validate our adapted CBA algorithms on three credit scoring datasets in table 1. In order to get a more comprehensive evaluation, these datasets are also classified by original CBA, the classical decision tree technique C4.5 [14] and Neural Network three layers and Back propagation employed parameter ?  in dilated chi-square and the number of neurons in hidden layer were tuned for best classification accuracy. C4.5 and Neural Network were implemented by the software package of WEKA [15 The number of The continuous attributes are discretized based on entropy [16] if needed datasets Inputs \(con./dis Austr 14\(6/8 Germ 20\(7/13 Bene 28\(18/10 Table 1. Credit scoring datasets Among these three datasets, Austr and Germ are from UCI repository datasets [17], and Bene is from one major financial institution in the Benelux Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg the dataset size of Austr and Germ are no more than 1000, 10-cross validation method was applied to evaluate the classification performance so as to reduce the fluctuations that stem from random sampling. For dataset Bene, 2/3 of its samples were taken as the training set and 1/3 of them as test set As shown in Table 2, adapted CBA 1 and CBA 2  which correspond to the adapted CBA algorithms that incorporate intensity of implication and dilated 2 respectively, perform well with respect to classification accuracy and number of rules they generated \(for Austr and Germ, the number of rules are the average results of 10-cross validation carried out on Bene in a train/test way, McNemar test 18] are employed to examine whether the predictive performance of these algorithms are significantly different with each other. The test results are listed as follows Original CBA Adapted CBA1 Adapted CBA2 C45 NN Original CBA 1.000 0.393 0.554 0.005 0.752 Adapted CBA1 1.000 0.221 0.038 0.718 Adapted CBA2 1.000 0.001 0.377 C45 1.000 0.019 NN 1.000 Table 3. McNemar test on dataset Bene The p-values in table 3 reveals that there are no significant differences among original CBA, adapted CBA and Neural Networks at 1% confidence level 


CBA and Neural Networks at 1% confidence level while they are all significantly better than C4.5 decision tree. Taking the interpretability of classification model into account, these two adapted CBA algorithm seem to be appropriate choices for credit scoring because they generated much more compact decision lists \(less sequential rules original CBA. They therefore favour the well-known Occam  s Razor theory and are more suitable for decision makers to understand. A deeper insight into the rules structures shows that original CBA and adapted CBA 1 both focus on generating classification rules that predict good clients \(with bad clients as the default class implication, numerous rules with high confidence but low support have lower ranks than they are in original CBA. These rules are finally discarded since they are not fired by any training samples, which are matched by these rules with higher intensity of implications thus making the decision lists generated by adapted CBA 1 more compact. Adapted CBA 2 mainly mines these classification rules for bad clients \(with good clients as the default class compact rule sets Original CBA Adapted CBA1 Adapted CBA2 C45 NN dataset accuracy no. of rules accuracy num. of rules accuracy no. of rules accuracy accuracy 1 Austr 85.65% 130.5 86.52% 26.4 86.96% 12.4 86.52% 85.07 2 Germ 73.30% 134 74.40% 56.5 73.20% 19.7 72.40% 74.90 3 Bene 72.92% 393 72.30% 186 73.51% 51 70.21% 72.63 Table 2.

Conclusion Intensity of implication is proposed in the beginning as an interestingness measure for association rules Another novel interestingness measure called dilated chi-square is designed by us to reveal the statistical interdependence between the antecedents and consequents of association rules We then adapt CBA algorithm, which can be used to build classifiers based on class association rules, by coupling it with intensity of implication and dilated chi-square respectively. More concretely, Intensity of implication \(or dilated chi-square primary criterion to rank class association rules at the first step of the database coverage pruning procedure in CBA algorithm. Experiments on three credit scoring datasets proved that these two adapted algorithms compared with original CBA, classical C4.5 decision tree and neural network, achieve satisfactory performance and generates classifiers much more compact than CBA 6.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type. The pattern-covering operator, denoted as ?p\(c,D all patterns in c representing D. More formally p\(c,D t.a1, ..., t.an true Note that: ?p\(c,D p,D 6. Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
