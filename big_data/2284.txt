tion to infer larger clusters of text reuse As we explain in more detail below there are two primary sources of error in this process in addition to the appearance of resemblance arising by chance that affects other work on sequence similarity from NLP to bioinformatics First since our collections contain multiple documents from the same source precision can be hurt by often substantial amounts of intra-source text reuse which are not as important when looking for evidence of interaction among sources Second since we are often interested in mapping networks in historical data text that has been poorly transcribed by optical character recognition can depress recall Our approach like many others involves shinglingéÑevaluating document pairs by the intersection of their n-gram features but these considerations require further reìnements to optimize effectiveness and efìciency In particular we employ hashing for space-efìcient indexing of repeated n-grams and the use of overlapping n-grams to prune dynamic programming for local alignment Before describing methods for detecting and clustering passages of local text reuse in  3 we provide background on reprinting in 19c newspapers in order to motivate some of our design choices   2 In  4 we describe an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efìciency of various text reuse detection approaches Finally we investigate interesting properties of the most popular texts explore the geographic spread and network connections of different texts and publications and analyze some of the text reuse dynamics of different genres of texts   5 2 Tracking Viral Texts in 19c Newspapers In American Literature and the Culture of Reprinting  McGill ar gues that American literary culture in the nineteenth century was shaped by the widespread practice of reprinting stories and poems usually without authorial permission or even knowledge in newspapers magazines and books Without substantial copyright enforcement texts circulated promiscuously through the print market and were often revised by editors during the process These viral textsÑbe they news stories short ction or poetryÑare much more than historical curiosities The texts that editors chose to pass on are useful barometers of what was exciting or important to readers during the period and thus offer signiìcant insight into the priorities and concerns of the culture Nineteenth-century U.S newspapers were usually associated with a particular political party religious denomination or social cause e.g temperance or abolition Mapping the speciìc locations and venues in which varied texts circulated would therefore allow us to answer questions about how reprinting and the public sphere in general were affected by geography communication and transportation networks and social political and religious afìnities To study the reprint culture of this period we crawled the online newspaper archives of the Library of Congressês Chronicling America project chroniclingamerica.loc.gov Since the Chronicling America project aggregates state-level digitization efforts there are some signiìcant gaps e.g there are no newspapers from Massachusetts which played a not insubstantial role in the literary culture of the period While we continue to collect data from other sources in order to improve our network analysis the current dataset remains a useful and open testbed for text reuse detection and analysis of overall trends Another difìculty with this collection is that it consists of the OCRêd text of newspaper issues without any marking of article breaks headlines or other structure The local alignment methods described in  3.2 are designed not only to mitigate this problem but also to deal with partial reprinting One newspaper issue for instance might reprint chapters 4 and 5 of a Thackeray novel while another issue prints only chapter 5 Since our goal is to detect texts that spread from one venue to another we are not interested in texts that were reprinted frequently in the same newspaper or series  to use the cataloguing term This includes material such as mastheads and manifestos and also the large number of advertisements that recur week after week in the same newspaper The methods we discuss in this paper could also be applied of course to other domains Most closely related to previous work on plagiarism detection is the investigation in historical and literary studies of the sources that inîuenced a text sometimes referred to as source criticism  3 Text Reuse Detection As noted above we are interested in detecting passages of text reuse individual articles that comprise a very small fraction of the containing documents newspaper issues Using the terminology of biological sequence alignment we are interested in local alignments between documents Henzinger provides a good overview of text reuse detection research and provides an empirical evaluation of the two primary methodsÑn-gram shingling and localitysensitive hashing LSH near-duplicate webpage detection tasks The need for local alignments makes LSH less practical without performing a large number 87 


of sliding-window matches 1 We therefore base our approach on n-gram shingling Several attributes distinguish the present approach from previous work  The boundaries of the reused passages are not known in contrast to near-duplicate document detection and to work on meme tracking that takes text between quotation marks as the unit of reuse 1  Also in contrast to this work on the contemporary news cycle and blogosphere we are interested both in texts that are reprinted within a few days and after many years We thus cannot exclude potentially matching documents for being far removed in time  We are looking for reuse of substantial amounts of text on the order of 100 words or more in contrast to work on detecting shorter quotations 8 9 10  We wish to compute all nearest neighbor passages instead of running a small number of query documents against a corpus  Text reuse that occurs only among documents from the same source should be excluded Henzinger notes for instance that man y o f the errors in near-duplicate webpage detection arose from false matches among documents from the same website that shared boilerplate navigational elements  We require methods that are robust to noisy OCR transcripts While we could adopt a pipelined approach and perform OCR correction before text reuse detection it is worth noting that a promising source of data for OCR correction are the clusters of similar passages found in other documents In common with work in duplicate detection we start the search for reused passages by rst nding likely document pairs For each document pair returned by this rst step we then identify a passage embedded within each document that is a good local match for the other We then greedily aggregate this pairwise data into large clusters of reused text passages We now describe the details of each step in turn 3.1 Search for Candidate Document Pairs We begin with a scan for document pairs likely to contain reprinted passages We use shingling which represents documents by an unordered collection of its 1 While there is some work on embedding string edit distances for LSH it applies to measures of global alignment such as Hamming distance and cyclic shifts n-grams to provide features for document similarity computations We balance recall and precision by adjusting the size of the shingles and the proportion of the shingles that are used to calculate document similarity After determining which features will be used to represent documents we build an index of the repeated n-grams and then extract candidate document pairs from this index Table 1 shows the parameters used in our approach 3.1.1 N-gram Document Representations The choice of document representation affects the precision and recall as well as the time and space complexity of a text reuse detection system In our experiments we adopt the popular choice of n-grams contiguous subsequences of n words Very similar passages of sufìcient length will share many long subsequences but long n-grams are less robust to textual variation and OCR errors As we see in the experiments below   4 values of n between 5 and 7 provide a reasonable tradeoff between accuracy and efìciency for the newspaper corpus In previous work on detecting short quotes or memes short contiguous n-grams have been proven to be quite effective Suen et al for instance use 4-grams to identify similar quotes in newspaper articles and blogs Many xed phrases however will also be detected by that approach For instance two documents are not much more likely to be derived from the same source if they both include the 5-grams it is no accident that and in the nal analysis it As describe below we can mitigate this problem by putting an upper bound on the document frequency of the n-grams we use In addition to standard contiguous n-grams therefore we also explored the use of skip n-grams or non-contiguous subsequences of the document Skip ngrams allow us to look at subsequences of words that fall in more widely separate parts of the document We parameterized our skip n-grams by n  the number of terms included g  the minimum gap between terms and w  the maximum number of terms covered by the skip n-gram A contiguous 5-gram would thus be n 5 g 1 w 5 In this paper we conìne ourselves to skip bigrams  n 2 with width up to 105 3.1.2 Downsampling Document Features Since duplicate texts will share many matching n-grams many duplicate detection systems use only a small fraction of the n-grams to represent each document One of the most popular downsampling techniques is 0 mod p  When inde xing a document this technique hashes each n-gram to an integer and then 88 


determines whether the hash value is divisible by some integer p  Since instances of the same n-gram in all documents hash to the same value the algorithm does not need to maintain a dictionary of the downsampled features This also permits easy parallelization since the hash functions can be computed independently in each batch Many duplicate detection systems for the web use values of p of 50 or above which drastically reduces index sizes This do wnsampling technique is less effective for local as opposed to global text reuse and can also hurt recall for noisily OCR d documents as we see below For bigrams we also adopt ltering on stopwords While indexes of longer n-grams are not dominated by stopword-only entries pairs of stopwords can increase the size of a bigram index signiìcantly Due to the prevalence of OCR errors in the newspaper dataset we treat all words of four or fewer characters as stopwords Also on the stoplist are the terms with the highest document frequency that make up 2  3 of the tokens in the corpus On the newspaper collection leaving out the four-character-or-less terms this amounted to 1440 stopwords We ignore any bigram with at least one stopword This lter proved to be too stringent with longer n-grams though some variants might be successful 3.1.3 Efìcient N-gram Indexing The next step is to build for each n-gram feature an inverted index of the documents where it appears As in other duplicate detection and text reuse applications we are only interested in the n-grams shared by two or more documents The index therefore does not need to contain entries for the n-grams that occur only once We use the two-pass space-efìcient algorithm described in Huston et al which empirically  i s v ery ef cient on lar ge collections In a rst pass n-grams are hashed into a xed number of bins On the second pass n-grams that hash to bins with one occupant can be discarded other postings are passed through Due to hash collisions there may still be a small number of singleton n-grams that reach this stage These singletons are ltered out as the index is written In building an index of n-grams an index of n-1 grams can also provide a useful lter No 5-gram for example can occur twice unless its constituent 4-grams occur at least twice We do not use this optimization in our experiments in practice n-gram indexing is less expensive than the later steps 3.1.4 Extracting and Ranking Candidate Pairs Once we have an inverted index of the documents that contain each skip n-gram we use it to generate and Table 1 Parameters for text reuse detection n n-gram order w maximum width of skip n-grams g minimum gap of skip n-grams p modulus for downsampling n-grams using 0mod p 11 u upper bound on distinct series in the posting list rank document pairs that are candidates for containing reprinted texts Each entry or posting list  in the index may be viewed as a set of pairs  d i p i  that record the document identiìer and position in that document of that n-gram Once we have a posting list of documents containing each distinct n-gram we output all pairs of documents in each list We suppress repeated n-grams that appear in different issues of the same newspaper These repetitions often occur in editorial boilerplate or advertisements which while interesting are outside the scope of this project We also suppress n-grams that generate more than  u 2  pairs where u is a parameter 2 These frequent n-grams are likely to be common xed phrases Filtering terms with high document frequency has led to signiìcant speed increases with small loss in accuracy in other document similarity work We then sort the list of repeated n-grams by document pair which allows us to assign a score to each pair based on the number of overlapping n-grams and the distinctiveness of those n-grams When downsampling n-grams with 0 mod p  we use the entire ranked list otherwise we conìne our evaluation to document pairs with 5 or more shared n-grams 3.2 Local Document Alignment The initial pass returns a large ranked list of candidate document pairs but it ignores the order of the n-grams as they occur in each document We therefore employ local alignment techniques to nd compact passages with the highest probability of matching The goal of this alignment is to increase the precision of the detected document pairs while maintaining high recall Due to the high rate of OCR errors many n-grams in matching articles will contain slight differences Unlike some partial duplicate detection techniques based on global alignment we cannot e xpect all or even most of the articles in two newspaper issues or the text in two books with a shared quotation to align Rather as in some work on biological subsequence alignment we are looking for re gions of high overlap embedded within sequences that are otherwise 2 The lter is parameterized this way because it is applied after removing document pairs in the same series 89 


unrelated We therefore employ the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm with an afìne gap penalty We use the simplest form of a weight matrix common in the bioinformatics community matching characters have a weight of 2 mismatches have 1 opening a gap is 5 and continuing a gap is 0.5 This use of model-based alignment also distinguishes this approach for other work for detecting shorter quotations that greedily expands areas of n-gram overlap 8 W e do ho we v e r  prune the dynamic programming search by forcing the alignment to go through position pairs that contain a matching n-gram from the previous step as long as the two n-grams are unique in their respective texts Even the exact Smith-Waterman algorithm however is an approximation to the problem we aim to solve If for instance two separate articles from one newspaper issue were reprinted in another newspaper issue in the opposite orderÑor separated by a long span of unrelated matterÑthe local alignment algorithm would simply output the better-aligned article pair and ignore the other Anecdotally we only observed this phenomenon once in the newspaper collection where two different parodies of the same poem were reprinted in the same issue In any case our approach can straightforwardly align two passages in the same document to different passages in two other documents 3.3 Passage Clustering We now have a set of aligned passage pairs We sort the passage pairs in descending order by length and perform greedy single-link clustering If two passages in the same document overlap by 80 they are taken to be the same passage for purposes of clustering otherwise they are treated as different passages Given this placement of passages into equivalence classes we can view this step as detecting connected components in the graph of aligned passages The V equivalence classes form the vertices the edges are the E pairwise connections between passages determined by the previous alignment step When clustering in a single pass through the pairwise data using Tarjanês disjoint set algorithm required O  V  space and O  V  E    E V  time where   m n  is the inverse Ackermann function This function gro ws so slo wly that the algorithm is effectively linear in the input size Table 2 shows an example cluster 4 Evaluating Reprint Detection For the pre-Civil War period our corpus contains 1.6 billion words from 41,829 issues of 132 newspapers The collection was created with OCR of middling accuracy as can be seen in table 2 To evaluate the precision and recall of text reuse detection we create a pseudo-relevant set of document pairs by pooling the results of several runs with different parameter settings For each document pair found in the union of these runs we observe the length in matching characters of the longest local alignment Using matching character length allows us to abstract somewhat from the precise cost matrix We can then observe how many aligned passages each method retrieves that are at least 50,000 character matches in length at least 20,000 character matches in length and so on The candidate pairs are sorted by the number of overlapping n-grams we measure the pseudo-recall at several length cutoffs For each position in a ranked list of document pairs we then measure the precision what proportion of documents retrieved are in fact 50k 20k etc in length Since we wish to rank documents by the length of the aligned passages they contain this is a reasonable metric As a summary of these precision values we employ the average precision  the mean of the precision at every rank position that contains an actually relevant document pair One of the few earlier evaluations of local text reuse by Seo and Croft compared ngerprinting methods to a trigram baseline Since their corpus contained short individual news articles the extent of the reused passages was evaluated qualitatively rather than by alignment Table 3 shows the average precision of different parameter settings on the newspaper collection ranked by the number of pairs each returns If the pairwise document step returns a large number of pairs we will have to perform a large number of more costly Smith-Waterman alignments On this collection a good tradeoff between space and speed is achieved by skip bigram features In the best case we look at bigrams where there is a gap of at least 95 and not more than 105 words between the rst and second terms n=2 u=100 w=105 g=95 5 Exploratory Data Analysis For a reader of today one of the most striking aspects of 19c U.S newspapers is the mixture of what we would recognize as news items with other genres such as poetry chapters of novels jokes and morally edifying anecdotes of vague origin After looking in detail at some of the more popular reprinted texts   5.1 we look in aggregate at the geographic and network connections among newspapers that can be inferred from the reprinting data   5.2 Finally   5.3 we explore how different genres may be distinguished 90 


Table 2 Example cluster from newspaper corpus Only the beginnings of the text of the story by popular temperance writer T S Arthur are shown In addition to the many obvious OCR errors there are editorial changes as well such as omitting Mr in the third text or changing backwards to backward in the second two texts These changes were checked against the page images Such changes provide evidence for how texts propagate 1841-04-17 soft answer n y t s arthur ill give him law to his hearts content the scoundrel said mr singleton walking backwards and forwards Sunbury American 1847-02-05 soft aasffch bv t s arthuit 1 4 ill give him law to his hearts coii ent fhe scoundrel said mr single on walking backwards and forwards Anti-slavery Bugle 1847-05-04 soft answer by t s arthur ill fìve him inw to his hearts content the scoundrel said singleton walking bick ward and forward Somerset Herald 1847-07-22 soft answer e y t s arthur ill give him law to his hearts content the scoundrep said singleton walking backward and forward Vermont Watchman Table 3 Average precision on detecting reprinted passages of different minimum lengths measured in the number of matching characters See Table 1 for explanations of the parameters of different runs Average precision on passages at least Method Pairs 50k 20k 10k 5k 2k 1k  n=10 u=100 3,342,162 0.18 0.09 0.10 0.10 0.24 0.31 n=7 u=50 3,579,992 0.22 0.18 0.20 0.20 0.22 0.30 n=2 u=50 w=55 g=45 4,297,764 0.32 0.30 0.28 0.27 0.21 0.27 n=6 u=50 4,433,792 0.21 0.20 0.22 0.21 0.21 0.31 n=7 u=100 5,971,269 0.20 0.11 0.12 0.14 0.30 0.44 n=5 u=50 6,443,100 0.21 0.22 0.25 0.22 0.20 0.31 n=2 u=100 w=105 g=95 7,512,442 0.34 0.30 0.25 0.29 0.40 0.47 n=2 u=100 w=55 g=45 9,756,985 0.31 0.26 0.21 0.24 0.32 0.45 n=2 u=100 w=25 g=15 12,798,056 0.28 0.24 0.19 0.21 0.26 0.39 n=5 u=100 15,258,185 0.19 0.15 0.15 0.17 0.30 0.47 n=4 u=50 17,954,922 0.19 0.23 0.27 0.23 0.18 0.28 n=5 u=100 p=10 43,701,236 0.19 0.15 0.15 0.16 0.26 0.35 n=4 u=100 71,263,521 0.16 0.17 0.17 0.18 0.26 0.42 n=5 u=100 p=5 77,771,798 0.18 0.15 0.15 0.17 0.28 0.41 not only by their content but also by the timing of their spread from one publication to another 5.1 Reprinting and Textual Repurposing Our initial list of the most reprinted articles is generically quite diverse indicating that reprinting was not limited to particular genres of writing but reîected the range of materials included in most 19c newspapers Top reprints from the corpus we have analyzed from the period of 1830Ö1860 include the following  the March 4 1857 inaugural address of President James Buchanan over 150 reprints  Washingtonês Farewell Address 53 reprints  a recipe for making starch with gum Arabic to refresh and renew lawns linens and muslins 46  A Beautiful Reîection by Edward BulwerLytton on the certain immortality of life 43  message of Queen Victoria to Pres Buchanan conveyed over the Atlantic telegraph upon the completion of the Atlantic cable in 1858 43  December 1860 speech by President Buchanan proposing a subsequently failed amendment to the constitution guaranteeing the right to own slaves 36  the text of the 1848 Treaty of GuadeloupeHidalgo ending the Mexican War and granting the US ownership of Texas and California 35  the Soldierês Bill passed by Congress in 1850 guaranteeing pension rights to soldiers and their widows 34  report on the defeat of the Austrian army in the Battle of Montebello during the Second Italian War for Independence in 1859 33  a story titled Household Economy proclaiming the educational and moral value to children of reading newspapers in the home 32 As this list indicates reprints provide a vivid and engaging picture of the quotidian concerns of the American newspaper public in the nineteenth century as well a sharp historical lens onto the period But given the diversity of genres and interests included on this list of heavily reprinted articles what might account for the virality of heavily recirculated texts One hypothesis is the following quite a number of texts that are frequently reprinted have resonances in 91 


multiple contextsÑthat is these texts have legs that allow them to migrate into new publication venues The second most reprinted article on our list Washingtonês Farewell Address provides an instance of this phenomenon Unlike Buchananês inaugural address which clearly had news value in 1857 Washingtonês addressÑinitially delivered in 1796Ñdid not But whereas Buchananês address or excerpts from it was often reprinted as a stand-alone article Washingtonês address or more accurately signiìcant excerpts from it typically appears embedded within an article on another topic Further the excerpts from Washingtonês address are most often those concerning the need for national unityÑa topic with signiìcant political and rhetorical currency in the period preceding the Civil War However the articles in which Washingtonês address appears are themselves diverse for instance portions of the address appear in a report on the Republican convention denouncing the slave power of the south in the Vermont Phoenix August 25 1855 in a context one might expect but also in a less anticipated contextÑnamely a piece on the swearing in of Freemasons to the third degree that appeared in the Nashville Union and American May 29 1855 A second example shows evidence of legs as well but of a different sort In the case of the message from Queen Victoria to President Buchanan transmitted over the newly completed Atlantic Telegraph the reprinting of the Queenês words involved an unfolding news story that hinged upon the error of a hapless telegraph operator Initially only half of the Queenês greeting was transmitted because the telegraph operator snipped the message in half Thus following an initial round of stories including half of the Queenês words a second round of articles appeared in which the Queenês full message was included And nally a third round of articles appeared that repeated the Queenês message following a 60,000-person march in Chicago celebrating the completion of the transatlantic telegraph The words of both Queen Victoria and George Washington then were put to multiple uses and went viral in part because they had meaning in the context of diverse narratives of news and politics 5.2 Geographic and Network Analysis Looking beyond the details of individual texts we can use our large and growing index of viral texts to begin modeling the systems that underlay nineteenthcentury print culture If we take reprinted texts as strong indicators of connection and inîuence among newspapers and among their editors we can use our database of recirculated texts to map those connections both geographically and as a network Literary scholars and historians have in the past been limited in their analyses of print culture by the constraints of physical archives and human capacity A lone scholar cannot read much less make sense of millions of newspaper pages With the aid of computational linguistics tools and digitized corpora however we are working toward a large-scale systemic understanding of how texts were valued and transmitted during this period Using geographic information system software our uncovered print histories can be correlated with other spatial data such as historical county boundaries census reports and transportation data to construct individual and comparative models of geographic dispersal Using only the broadest data point from the censusÑraw populationÑwe can compare the potential audiences for different viral texts For instance John Greenleaf Whittierês agricultural hymn The Huskers was reprinted 30 times within our data set and 634,499 people lived within 5 miles of its sites of reprinting By contrast the Scottish poet Charles MacKayês religious poem alternately titled The Inquiry and The Resting Place was reprinted 30 times with 5 miles of 609,709 people There are a range of other interesting data points in the census reports that we plan to explore more fully as the project develops In 1840 for instance census takers were interested in the print industry and they recorded the number of daily weekly and monthly newspapers in each county as well as the number of magazines and other periodicals These data will help us understand how the print culture reconstructed through recirculation data lines up or does not line up with 19c Americans understanding of print culture Perhaps most compelling in our early spatial analyses has been the close correlation between the growth of reprinting networks and the growth of transportation technologies particularly the railroad As the rail network grows connecting ever-smaller pockets of the country to the major hubs in the east so to do the reprinted stories spread further and further outside major cities Indeed trafìc seems to have moved in both directions though unevenly While the majority of the viral texts in our data set do seem to begin in major cities such as New York and spread from there to the south and west a more signiìcant minority of texts than we expected move in the opposite direction beginning in smaller country newspapers and spreading from there into more metropolitan papers In future we plan to develop more robust techniques to

 Figure 1 Visualization of the links among newspapers induced by shared reprinted texts Colors indicate communities derived from graph modularity ography gure 1 In these graphs the nodes represent individual newspapers while the edges are weighted based on how many texts two newspapers share The communities of practice highlighted in these graphs often stretch across antebellum America One community of reprinting partners for instance includes newspapers in Vermont New York Ohio and Missouri which was in the west of the United States during the period of our study These connections suggest further research When the network graphs suggested a close connection between the Vermont Phoenix Brattleboro Vermont and the Fremont Journal Fremont Ohio for instance we investigated further only to discover that the editors of these papers were brothers-in-law These geographic and network modeling techniques then have pointed to new and relevant questions for humanities elds such as history and literary studies 5.3 Reuse Dynamics Reading Fast and Slow The corpus of reprinted texts also reveals interesting temporal patterns Some texts are reprinted frequently at rst and then become less popular others continue to attract interest from newspaper editorsÑand presumably readersÑfor years afterwards Figure 2 shows the median lag time in log number of days between the rst observed appearance and later reprints The lag times are plotted by the year of a textês rst occurrence We omit plots for 1856Ö60 due to boundary effects Most obviously there are simply more texts and more newspapers as time goes on In many years there are two peaks in the frequency of lag time at around one week and over 3 years In 1846Ö7 for example there is an increase in short lag-time fast texts due in part to coverage of the Mexican-American War In later years these fast texts become more frequent We suspect that this is in part explained by the rise of wire services though more research is needed Not surprisingly different kinds of texts travel fast and slow We divided reprinted texts into a fast set with median lag times under one year and a slow set with median lag times over ve years which gave approximately equal sets We trained a logistic regression model to predict whether a text would be fast or slow Features were all words in a textês rst occurrence that 1 were ve characters or more in length and 2 occurred ve or more times in the corpus The year of rst occurrence was included as a categorical feature to account for the different proportions in fast and slow texts over time The training objective function was regularized with an L 1 Lasso penalty to achieve a sparse set of predictors Table 4 shows the top negative fast and positive slow coefìcients Highly correlated with fast textual propagation for example are terms related to the Mexican-American War such as Texas  Mexico  and Taylor  Also interesting are government and tariff  cases and corpse  Slow texts focus on love and other affective terms on heaven and interestingly woman  The year 1840 is also a useful predictor since fewer texts from that year were fast With a random split between training and test logistic regression achieved 73 accuracy on test When earlier years 1840Ö1849 were used to predict a later one 1850 accuracy fell to 60 Taking the cross product of year and word features only slightly diminished this overìtting effect and more analysis of the rhetorical patterns of different genres should be helpful Linear regression on the log median lag produced similar coefìcients but fairly poor predictive accuracy 6 Conclusions We have described efìcient algorithms that exploit shingling space-efìcient hashed indexing and local alignment to detect clusters of passages reprinted within large collections of noisily OCRêd texts without a priori knowledge of which texts were repeated Applied to a collection of 19c U.S newspapers these techniques uncover a corpus of popular but now often obscure texts of diverse genres geographic distribution and temporal dynamics By analyzing patterns of reprinting we hope to explore how ideas spread which ideas spread and which segments of the public shared ideas These techniques thus stand to yield insight into the nature of the print public sphere in the nineteenth century at a level of speciìcity heretofore unavailable 93

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
