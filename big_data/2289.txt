 HOW TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY ON ANALYSING BIG DATA ON A LARGE NUMBER OF MEASUREMENT AND VERIFICATION PROJECTS  GP De Jager and LJ Grobler School for mechanical engineering Potchefstroom Campus, North-We st University, South Africa  ABSTRACT  Big data can be defined as a collection of large and complex data sets which are difficult to process using readily available or traditional data processing applications. These big d ata sets introduce new challenges such as capture, storage, search, sharing transfer, analysis, versioning and visualization  This paper present a design philosophy, techniques and experience, from an information technology perspective, in dealing with large quantities of energy data. It provide a vehicle for the general \(non-IT to increase his or her efficiency in analysing and visualizing energy data for business decisions  1 INTRODUCTION  The inevitable result of dealing with a vast number of energy projects is big data Big data can be defined as a large and complex collection of data which became difficult to process using readily available or traditional data processing applications  Raw data on its own is nothing but a bunch of unusable numbers, letters, or words and working through t housands of these can be laborious and confusing u m e of data makes it big, however even small amounts of data can be leveraged by some new tech niques r words data is not just big in terms of size, but also big in terms of comparative advantage  This paper focus on the infrastructure and technologies underlying the management of large quantities of Measurement and Verificatio n \(M&V\ related data. M&V has the objectives to quantify and assess impacts and sustainability of Demand-Side Management \(DSM\nd energy-efficiency projects  Usually M&V teams receive data in no standardized manner.  The means of data collection may vary from manual techniques such as te xt files received via email, to automated systems integrated with real-time-metering solutions. Without the correct systems in place, the unavoidable consequence w ill be unstructured and distributed data which hold challenges as numerous as the opportunities  Effective data management and the ability to refine data into greater business insights may deliver benefits such as profitable decision-making, enhanced quality of service and new product offeri Dat a i s changi ng t h e gam e  i n a lot of industries and those who have the ability to wield it can perform more efficiently than those who do not. Once the domain only of actuaries and scientists, big data can now be exploited with new tec hnologies by a wide range of peopl   This paper briefly discuss a typical M&V data life cycle and its underpinning infrastructure to support further data mining  2 THE DATA LIFE CYCLE  At the start of the data life cycle, individuals will have primary responsibility for stewardship But  i f data grows rapidly and are to be consolidated and shared frequently a good and reliable infrastructure is essential The importance of a solid data infrastructure cannot be more emphasized as scientists are not necessarily good data managers and can more effec tively spend their time doing science. Also, it is increasingly ineffective to assign long term information management tasks for example to a rotating staff of students or in   Figure 1 depicts the typical life cycle of M&V data Because of the various data sources and collection techniques of raw M&V data, the data is unstructured and dispersed and must be standardized. The final outputs can be numerous, but most common is to use data from one or more projects to generate reports or to mine valuable information from the data sets by further exploration   Figure 1 M&V data life cycle  The life cycle stages as depicted in figure 1 will be shortly discussed in the following sections  2.1 DATA CAPTURE  The first step is to Extract, Transform and Load \(ETL from the different sources of energy \(and other\a for each M&V project to a central database. A web based application allows general \(non-IT\ users to map data sources, whether it is a locally stored text file or data from a real-time metering solution from a relational database. The application also allows users to add functions to calculate  DB  www  ETL  DB  text Project Calc  BI  Reports  Analytics 


 new fields e.g. to calculat e demand \(kW\ values from one or more fields. The initial setup is a fairly once off process if  the supplier of the data is consistent with data structures and delivery methods. New data is periodically fetched from the specified source\(s\ a nd imported to the raw set of data. Where applicable the original documents are also stored. For Eskom M&V reporting the outcome is always 30 minute interval demand \(kW\ values \(and related data such as kVA, temperature, stat us, etc.\ which is stored in a relation database, centrally available to other systems  2.2 PROJECT INFORMATION  A user will add a new M&V project and capture specific and supportive information such as descriptions geographic information, demand and/or energy targets tariffs, etc  Also, part of the project is setup to fetch the correct data from the centralized collection of raw data \(as discussed in section 2.1\he project owner \(user\can export the 30 minute interval demand \(kW\ data for instance to use in a set of tools to engineer a baseline. A baseline is also uploaded to the central databa se and associated with a specific project   Figure 2 Visualization of Actual and Baseline data  At this stage a project is asso ciated with monthly actual and baseline data \(30min kW web based tool allows users to visualize the data \(see Figure 2\ in order to confirm data quality or spot irregularities  2.3 CALCULATIONS  At first all calculations was done on the fly when a report was generated. Calculations varies from the grouping of data into Eskom MegaFlex Time-Of-Use \(TOU\ods computing of targets and impacts, tariff calculations handling public holidays, etc.  However, when data sets accumulated to a few millions of records, report generation became time consuming. On top of that new report requirements increased complexity of calculations which on its turn worsen generation time and degrade user experience With traditional databases \(relational databases\is easier to get the data in than out as these are designed for efficient transactions processing such as inserters, updates or retrieval of small amounts of data Because of experiencing this first handed, a complete reconsideration of the infrastructure designs wa s necessary. This led to the investigation of a move towards a Business Intelligence BI  Instead of concurrent calculations, calculations are initiated by the user as soon as data actual and baseline imported. The calculation results are stored in a data warehouse which is also centrally available for any client tools to utilize. Data validations exists to ensure calculated data match with source data. It can happen that source data changes, e.g. better quality data was received and imported or there was a change to the tariff being used. In  such a case, calculations for the specific period will rerun  2.4 REPORT GENERATION  Getting data in has limited value, but when users and applications can utilize the da ta to support decisions the full value of the data warehouse can be realized Th e generation of M&V or related reports is one of the end goals of the infrastructure in place and the final stage in the data life cycle  Fundamental to a good user experience is quick report generation. Stored calculations in a data warehouse, holds the advantage of rapid report ge nerations. In a recent test case the ability was demonstrat ed to calculate M&V project summary results for the last month, Year To Date \(YTD and Inception To Date \(ITD\ore than 300 projects in just over one minute. Amongst ot hers, the results contained impacts, averages and totals for each Eskom MegaFlex TOU period and for each day type \(Weekday, Saturday Sunday  However, the value of the data it is not only limited to generating reports. The populat ed data warehouse is the fundamental core for analytics and the exploration of further information  from it, will be discussed in section 3  3 SELF SERVICE BI  Business Intelligence \(BI r to the key technologies that support the activity of transforming data into useful informatio The m a i n technol ogi es of BI enco m p ass data warehousing, On-Line Analytical Processing \(OLAP and data mining The p u r pose of t h ese sy st em s i s t o  support managers and other levels of decision makers in an organization to make informed decisions.  Also, BI as a term replaced decision support, executive information systems, and management information systems   To implement BI, an organizat ion need to re ly heavily on highly skilled professionals to source information from data using enterprise BI tools such as SAS or Business Objects  so t h e co m p l e x i t y associ at ed wi t h  t h e implementation of a BI system may require considerable resources. Self-service BI is the new buzzword, which allows users without specialised BI training or analytics experience, to develop data models and calculations 


 except the setup of a data warehouse underpinning the BI system Furt her m ore, sm all- t o m i d-si ze co m p an i e s need the ability to yield information without requiring unreasonable investments in hardware, software and people  In the engineering world, where M&V is no exception Microsoft Excel is probably the most used tool. However dealing with millions of rows in Excel can be challenging and time consuming. But, Microsoft released PowerPivot which is a add-in to the 2010 version and a built-in functionality of Excel 2013. As a self-service BI product PowerPivot allows users to conduct powerful BI in an environment that is already fa miliar and allows processing and analysing vast amounts of data that come from different and dispersed sources for discovering new knowledge [13    Figure 3 Subset of a PowerPivot data model with relationships  In this contribution, we show that Excel PowerPivot tables can be used to answer many questions or needs. Because self-service BI in the form of PowerPivot is used mostly by non tech-savvy staff, the IT department help users to understand what data is available and often also help to prepare the initial data models with its relationships and hierarchies \(see Figure 3\. The available data from the data warehouse and/or other sources can be defined as a metadata dictionary at the business layer level   Figure 4 Tabular view of a data model  By giving the staff Excel documents with already build data models, helps them to focus on the meaning of the data and not necessarily th e technology itself. Another major advantage is that the data in the Excel document is preloaded and disconnected from the life systems, which gives the user the freedom to add calculations or run big queries without hitting the da tabases or data warehouse with straining queries. Also, users can design and customize their own reports and create their own views of the data  Using PowerPivot as a self-service BI solution empower users with a large number of features and advantages. A short discussion of four of th ese is given in the subsequent sections  3.1 MANAGE LARGE DATA SETS  As mentioned previously, a standard Microsoft Excel worksheet is not ideal for large amounts of data. With a PowerPivot data model, the user can enjoy fast calculations on millions of rows with about the same experience as a few hundred of rows  3.2 COMBINE DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES  Data can be combined from multiple sources including relational databases, spread sheets, reports, text files internet data feeds, etc.  This functionality is really powerful. For example, a user retrieved M&V project data actual and baseline\m the data warehouse, but needs to correlate it with weather patterns. It is as easy to retrieve the weather data from an Internet data feed and relate it to the energy data timestamps. Also, a nice and important feature is that a user can refresh data to ensure that decisions is based on the most recent data  3.3 CALCULATIONS  Once the data is retrieved, the user has the freedom to add relationships, hierarchies, calculated columns,  measures or key performance indicators \(KPIs\ and has the ability to literally aggregate over millions of rows. Data analysis expressions \(DAX\s used for calculations, which is a very powerful formula language quite similar to normal Excel expressions. For example use BaselineValue    ActualValue to calculate a new field named Impact see Figure 4  3.4 VISUALIZATIONS   PowerPivot for Excel allows users to create a variety of visualizations in normal \(familiar\s. For example, data can be presented in pivot tables, pivot charts combinations of tables and charts or flattened pivot tables see Figure 5\her useful feature of Excel 2013 is PowerView, where users can de sign interactive reports that allows interactions such as drill-in and out.  The discussion of the functionality of these are beyond the scope of this paper. However, by combining these different visualizations, an appealing da shboard view can be built for really easy and fast analytics  


  Figure 5 PowerPivot with a PowerChart visualizing a summary of 25 M&V projects using more than 2 million records  According to research, organizations must embrace visualization tools as a form of communication, because business success can be hindered by falling into old habits of representing data    4. CONCLUSION  This paper included a discussion on the typical M&V data life cycle and mentioned some of the underlying technologies and importance of a good and solid infrastructure. The heart of the system is a good designed data warehouse which allows in stantaneous generations of large reports. However, fixed re ports is merely one of the numerous outputs. The true value lies in further exploration of valuable information hidden in the sea of data. Instead of investing in an expensive end-to-end BI solution \(which may have steep learning curves and require additional resources\ce BI solution was proposed  Microsoft Excel PowerPivot was presented as a self-service BI solution to handle a vast amount of M&V data from a data warehouse \(and other da ta sources\scovering new knowledge. The major advantage of this solution is that users work in a familiar environment where the focus is on the value of data instead of the technologies and infrastructures    5.

transfer this data would have been 2.47 seconds.  Figure 3 shows only data movement, and not the extra RTT required to confirm the transfer, which is included in the 2.47 and also reported by nuttcp.  The nuttcp command and output is nuttcp-7.1.6 -w512m -n 4102 20.20.20 100 256.3750 MB /   2.65 sec =  812.1586 Mbps 100 %TX 13 %RX 22 retrans 180.27 msRTT  C  Sensitivity to Variations in Latency and Packet Loss We have assumed throughout this paper a latency value of 180ms and packet loss rate of 0.01% in each direction and have argued that the former is a realistic estimate based on real-world measurements, and the latter is a worst-case scenario.  To show the sensitivity of the benchmark results to variations in those assumptions, the test in the preceding section was performed for a range of latencies and packet loss percentages.  Table 1 provides the results as reported by nuttcp As discussed earlier in this paper, the time needed by TCP to enable window scaling \(1 RTT\ is easily avoided Table 2 shows the median times from Table 1 with the additional assumption that TCP connections are reused or otherwise initialized such that the receive window is set as needed before data transmission is initiated D  Retransmission Tail In all of the tests conducted for Table 1, the throughput pattern is the same as that shown in Figure 3.  If we imagine the shape of the data in Figure 3 as a box, then the width of the box is exactly 2.30 seconds or less for all the runs listed in Table 1.  Packet loss rates influence the width of the box only very slightly, and latency does not affect it at all.  Even at 10% packet loss \(not shown\, the width of the box is only 2.66 seconds The higher transfer times at the higher latency and loss rates \(the bottom right portions of Table 1 and Table 2 caused by a “retransmission tail”.  This is a result of retransmission timeouts, with latency delays aggravated by the binary exponential backoff of the retransmission timer For example, in one of the runs with a RTT of 800ms and a packet loss rate of 1%, the box width was 2.30 seconds, as expected, but it took an additional 4.42 seconds to get the final bytes transferred and acknowledged.  We believe this retransmission tail can be reduced to just a just a few RTT times.  Implementing and testing this is left as future work E  Application Control This paper is focused on optimizing the network throughput in the context of a specific application.  This is necessary as the approach described here is not a general service whose run-time behavior can be implemented independently of the application using it.  The application controller or system administrator must be aware of all processes allowed to use a fixed congestion window.  Each application system needs to assess its ability to meet this requirement as part of the application system design process F  Latency Variability In this paper, the congestion window was calculated based on an unchanging latency \(RTT\ of 180ms.  On real networks, many factors cause the latency to change from the expected baseline value.  With respect to the application’s requirements, the crosstalk-corrected transfers do not miss their required time deadline until latency exceeds 360ms.  At higher latencies, the impact on payload throughput is inversely proportional \(twice the latency results in a halving of payload throughput\ so one could argue that a fixed latency assumption for this specific application use case is good enough.  There are no requirements problems in the case where latency is lower than the expected value However, in practice, we would chose to improve how the latency variations are handled, which is included in the future work section  Table 1.  Mean, median, and standard deviation time, in seconds, to transfer 10% of a compressed crosstalk-corrected image on a 1Gbps network for the indicated latencies and packet loss rates.  The results of 20 consecutive runs were included in each entry.  These results incl ude the extra time needed by TCP to adjust the receive window for new connections to use the window scaling factor 141 


VI  F UTURE W ORK  There are a number of operational and usability improvements that can be made to the congestion control code used in this testing.  The existing code serves only as a proof-of-concept.  Specific areas of improvement include adding flexibility to how the connections that are subject to the fixed congestion window are specified, and allowing the system administrator to specify an existing congestion control module for all other connections \(changing this module into a “stacked” kernel module\  Adjusting the congestion window for changes in latency \(RTT\ would likely be performed in the congestion control code, although other designs exist that would make this adjustment elsewhere.  There should also be some additional code to guard against extreme conditions, such as falling back to normal congestion control if packet loss begins to occur at catastrophic rates This paper does not discuss the controller design in any detail, but that is an important component of any application system leveraging this approach.  Such a controller could optionally, work in concert with a dynamic network provisioning system such as OSCARS[12 t o  en s u re  th e  required bandwidth guarantee.  In the special case where there is a one-to-one relationship between TCP sessions and virtual circuits, then the cwnd can be set at a maximum effectively transferring control of bandwidth management from the congestion control routine to the network devices In the alternative, some projects may elect to design their system such that congestion window assignments do not need to be changed dynamically, thus eliminating the need for a controller As with all testing conducted by simulating certain network characteristics, it is valuable to conduct the same benchmarks tests on real long-distance networks whenever possible.  For example, packet loss in this paper was assumed to be random, whereas testing on the real network is likely to reveal correlations in the distribution of packet loss Additionally, should LSST encounter packet loss rates far in excess of what is currently expected, then future work should include RTO modifications to reduce the retransmission tail which provides lower and more predictable transfer times at those very high packet loss rates VII  C ONCLUSION  In the era of big data, extracting the most value from expensive long-haul networks is critical.  This paper has presented an approach where, if bandwidth is guaranteed and connected hosts are managed, then data can be transferred at full link speed over high-latency international networks This approach to bandwidth management is transparent to userspace processes, and is compatible with all existing file transfer applications and utilities.  No application-layer code needs to be modified or recompiled The LSST project provided the use case scenarios discussed in this paper, but the solution can be adopted by any project or system if the necessary prerequisites are met A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The author would like to thank those who provided valuable feedback on early drafts of this paper, including Gregory Dubois-Felsmann, Jeff Kantor, Kian-Tat Lim, and Darrell Newcomb R EFERENCES  1  Martin-Flatin, J.
