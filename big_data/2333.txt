lung nodules in up to 30 of the positive cases To reduce the number of missed lung nodules in a method is presented to detect regions of lung images with abnormalities Studies presented in sho w an impro v ement in the performance of radiologists supported by a CAD system in detecting abnormalities in mammograms Also the diagnosis of colon cancer which is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world benef\002ts with the development of CAD tecniques In a method is presented that employs topographical height maps to analyze colon images and to reduce the false-positive colon cancer detection rate In a fuzzy c-means cl ustering technique is employed to classify the colon data Other very promising works in CAD 002eld have been developed to work with brain and li v er 5 In 10  a frame w ork which uses a decision-tree inductor is employed to discover relevant knowledge for medical image analysis and diagnosis Relevant works also applied association rules for image analysis 9 4 Association rule mining is one of the most important tasks in the data mining 002eld and it has been extensively studied and applied to market basket analysis The problem of mining association rules was 002rstly stated in  as follo ws Let I  f i 1      i n g be a set of literals called items A set X 022 I is called an itemset Let R be a table with transactions t involving elements that are subsets of I  An association rule is an expression of the form X  Y  where X and Y are itemsets X is called body or antecedent of the rule Y is called head or consequent of the rule The support is the ratio between the number of transactions of R containing the itemset X  Y and the total number of transactions of R  Con\002dence is the fraction of the number of transactions containing X that also contain Y  The problem of mining association rules as it was 002rstly stated consists of 002nding association rules that satisfy the restrictions of minimum support minsup and con\002dence minconf speci\002ed by the user CAD systems employ image mining a more complex process than the traditional data mining Image mining employs image processing algorithms to extract relevant features from the images organizing them in feature vectors The feature vectors are employed in place of the images to model them as transactions which are used in the mining process Features quantify intrinsic visual characteristics of the images such as color shape and texture leading to vectors with hundreds or even thousands of elements However a large number of features to represent the image can lead to the curse of dimensionality problem where the significance of each feature decreases To avoid this problem the IDEA method incorporates the Omega algorithm that also performs feature selection eliminating redundant and noisy features of the feature vector In this paper we present IDEA  a method based on association rules to support the diagnosis of medical images which is detailed in the next section 3 The IDEA Method IDEA is a supervised method that mines association rules relating visual features automatically extracted from images with the reports given by radiologists about the training images The reports are composed of a set of keywords Figure 1 shows the pipeline and the Algorithm 1 summarizes the steps of the IDEA method Algorithm 1 The steps the IDEA Method Input Training images a test image Output Report set of keywords 1 Extract features of the training images 2 Execute Omega algorithm 3 Mine association rules 4 Extract features of the test image 5 Execute ACE 6 Return the suggested report set of keywords Figure 1 Pipeline of the IDEA method In the training phase see Algorithm 1 features are extracted from the images and feature vectors are used to represent the images line 1 The feature vectors and the class of the training images are submitted to Omega which removes irrelevant features from the feature vector and gives a discretization of the remaining features line 2 The class of an image is the most important keyword chosen by the specialist to describe the image In the training phase a processed feature vector is merged with the diagnosis keywords about the training images producing the transaction representation of the images The transaction representations of all training images are submitted to the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining line 3 limiting the minimum con\002dence to high values In the test phase lines

4-6 the feature vector of the test image is extracted line 4 and submitted to the ACE algorithm line 5 which uses the association rules to suggest possible keywords to compose the diagnosis of the test image We discuss each step of the IDEA method as follows 3.1 Feature Extraction When dealing with medical images the earliest stage of a CAD system demands to extract the main image features regarding a speci\002c criterion One question that should be answered when working with image mining is which features best represent the semantical meaning of a given image Essentially the most representative features vary according to the image type e.g mammogram brain and lung and according to the focus of the analysis e.g to distinguish nodules and to identify brain white matter For instance when working with mammograms histogram features give a very poor identi\002cation of breast lesions However features of shape can work well to distinguish malignant and benign breast lesions Nevertheless most shape features demand a previous step of lesion segmentation and this step increases the computational effort to a great extent The IDEA method can work with various types of medical images with different focus of analysis However for each type of image and goal an appropriate feature extractor should be employed In our experiments we used two datasets of mammograms The images of the 002rst dataset are regions of interest and the focus of analysis is to identify characteristics of morphology histology and the severity of the lesions To represent this dataset we used a compact feature vector that combines texture shape and color characteristics The images of the second dataset are full mammograms and the focus of analysis is to identify the breast side the mammogram view and the breast density For this dataset a more robust feature vector is employed detailed in Section 4 3.2 The Omega Algorithm Omega is a new supervised algorithm that smartly prepares the feature vectors for the mining of association rules The Omega algorithm performs simultaneously data discretization and feature selection A measure of inconsistence is employed to determine the 002nal number of intervals and to select features As the number of intervals gets smaller the number of inconsistence increases Omega aims at keeping the minimal number of intervals with minimal inconsistency establishing a tradeoff between these measures A cut point is a limit of an interval of real values An interval is also called bin and the most frequent class in a bin is called majority class of the bin An inconsistence is an occurrence of a class different from the majority class in an interval Omega 002rst sorts the continuous values and de\002nes the initial cut points Every time that a change in the class label of the instances occurs a cut point is created In this step Omega produces pure bins wherein the entropy is the lowest possible zero In a second step Omega restricts the minimum frequency that a bin must present avoiding a huge number of cut points Omega removes the right cut points of the intervals that do not satisfy the minimum frequency restriction given by an input parameter H min  The higher the value of H min  the fewer the bins obtained in this step However some caution should be taken before adjusting the H min value the higher the H min  the higher the inconsistencies generated by the discretization process In a third step Omega fuses consecutive intervals using the inconsistence rate to determine which intervals should be merged Let M T i be the majority class of an interval T i  Equation 1 gives the inconsistence rate 020 T i of an interval T i  020 T i  j T i j 000 j M T i j j T i j 1 In Equation 1 j T i j is the number of instances in the interval T i and j M T i j is the number of instances of the majority class in T i  The Omega algorithm fuses consecutive intervals that have the same majority class and also have inconsistence rates below or equal an input threshold 020 max 0 024 020 max 024 1  The last step of Omega algorithm is to perform feature selection Let T be the set of intervals in which a feature is discretized For each feature Omega computes the global inconsistence 020 G value according to Equation 2 020 G  P T i 2 T  j T i j 000 j M T i j  P T i 2 T j T i j 2 The feature selection criterion employed by Omega removes from the set of attributes every attribute whose global inconsistence value is greater than an input threshold 020 G max  Since the number of inconsistencies of the features is the factor that most contribute to disturb the learning algorithm discarding the most inconsistent attributes can contribute to improve the accuracy and to speed up the learning algorithm 3.3 Association Rule Mining The IDEA method employs the Apriori algorithm to mine association rules The output of the Omega algorithm and the keywords of the report of the training images are submitted to the Apriori algorithm A constraint which restricts the diagnosis keywords to the head of the rules is added to the mining process The body of the rules is composed of indexes of the features and their intervals The

values of minimum con\002dence are set to be high greater than 97 An example of rule mined in this step is   malignant mass 0.05,1.0 This rule indicates that the images having the 4 st feature value in the closed interval 0  1 000 0   tend to be images of malignant masses The values 0.05 and 1.0 indicate respectively the support and the con\002dence values of the rule The support of 0.05 indicates that 5 of the training images has the 4 st feature value in 0  1 000 0   and also are malignant mass The con\002dence of 1.0 indicates that 100 of the training images which has the 4 th feature value in interval 0  1 000 0   are malignant masses The mined rules are used as input of the ACE algorithm 3.4 The ACE algorithm Before discussing the ACE  A ssociative C lassi\002er E ngine algorithm it is necessary to clarify some terms We say that an image matches a rule if the image features satisfy the whole body of the rule An image partially matches a rule if the image features only satisfy part of the rule's body An image does not match a rule if the image features do not satisfy any part of the rule's body ACE is a new special classi\002er able to return multiple classes keywords when processing a test image The ACE algorithm stores all itemsets set of keywords belonging to the head of the rules in a data structure An itemset h is returned by ACE in the suggested diagnosis if the following condition is satis\002ed M  h  025 1 and w  3 M  h  P  h  3 M  h  P  h  N  h  025 w min where M  h  is the number of matches of the itemset h  P  h  is the partial number of matches and N  h  is the number of no matches w is the weight of the itemset It indicates the strength that an itemset belongs to the diagnosis The higher the value of weight  the higher the con\002dence that h belongs to the diagnosis of the image A threshold of minimum weight w min 0 024 w min 024 1  is employed to limit the weight of an itemset in the suggested diagnosis If w min  0  all itemsets that have at least one match is returned Figure 2 shows an example of ACE working In this example M  h   1  P  h   1 and N  h   1 for the itemset h  f benign g  Therefore if 4 5 025 w min  the itemset h  f benign g is returned by the algorithm otherwise it is discarded Figure 2 Example of ACE working This section presented our proposed method As we will show in the section of experiments our proposed method is well-suited to suggest diagnoses for medical images enhancing and bringing more con\002dence to the diagnosing process 4 Experiments The experiments were performed employing 10 of the images from the datasets for testing and the remaining images for training The parameters of the Omega algorithm were set to H min  2  020 max  0  2 and 020 G max  0  3  which are tunning parameters of the algorithm The parameters of the algorithms remained the same for both experiments The values of minimum support minsup=0.005 and con\002dence minconf=1.0 were used as Apriori input parameters The value w min  0  which maximizes the ACE accuracy was employed as ACE input parameter 4.1 Experiment 1 the ROI Dataset The ROI dataset consists of 446 images of ROIs Regions of Interest comprising tumoral tissues taken from mammograms collected from the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System of the Department of Radiology of University of Vienna www.birads.at These ROIs were used to train new students of radiology Each image has a diagnosis composed of three main parts morphology mass or calci\002cation BI-RADS Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System and histology In the feature extraction step the images were segmented and features of texture shape and color were extracted from the segmented regions The segmentation process were performed eliminating from the image the regions with graylevel smaller than 0.14 in a gray-scale ranging and applying the well-known Otsu's technique to the resultant image The features shown in Table 1 were extracted from the segmented regions and used to compose the feature vector representation of the images Table 1 Features extracted from the ROI dataset and their positions feature position average intensity contrast 1-2 smoothness skewness 3-4 uniformity entropy 5-6 invariant moments 7 to 13 histogram mean standard deviation 14-15 The Omega algorithm was applied to the image features removing the 13 th feature It means that the 13 th feature is the least differentiating feature for the ROI dataset The output from Omega was submitted to Apriori algorithm where

662 rules were mined The association rules generated and the test images were submitted to the ACE algorithm which produced suggestions of diagnosis for each test image In a batch execution the test images were submitted to the IDEA system and the accuracy obtained considering the main parts of the diagnosis morphology and Bi-RADS were Morphology 91.3  BI-RADS value 96.7  Since BI-RADS categorization has a fuzzy separation among consecutive levels even for a human being we considered correct if the BI-RADS level suggested was the same or adjacent of the level annotated by the radiologist in the image report This result indicates that the employed features represent more the BI-RADS level of the lesion than the morphological properties of the images Table 2 shows the values of accuracy sensitivity and speci\002city achieved by IDEA in detecting the BI-RADS levels Table 2 Results achieved by IDEA in detecting the BI-RADS levels over the ROI dataset Accuracy 96.7 Sensitivity 91.3 Speci\002city 71.4 The system was also evaluated by two radiologists who demonstrated a high degree of acceptance for it They reported that the system had indicated lesions that they did not see in a 002rst analysis Figure 3 shows a screenshot of the system when analyzing the image on left of the screenshot The system shows the weight of each diagnosis keyword between parentheses The weight indicates the strength of the respective diagnosis part The higher the weight the higher the con\002dence that the keyword re\003ects the true diagnosis of the image Figure 3 Screenshot of the IDEA system 4.2 Experiment 2 the Mammogram Dataset The Mammogram dataset is composed of 1,080 mammograms collected in the Clinical Hospital of University of Sao Paulo at Ribeir  ao Preto The Mammogram dataset contains images classi\002ed in 4 levels of breast tissue density 1 mostly fatty 362 images 2 partly fatty 446 images 3 partly dense 200 images and 4 mostly dense 72 images Figure 4 illustrates examples of the images of this dataset Breast density is an important risk factor in the development of breast cancer In this experiment the images are represented by the feature set proposed in compounding a vector of 85 features including shape and size of the breast the conditions of the breast contour nipple position and the distribution of 002broglandular tissue level 1 level 2 level 3 level 4 Figure 4 Examples of images from the Mammogram dataset Images from left to right correspond respectively to mammograms of density levels 1 2 3 and 4 The visual analysis of mammograms by radiologists is a subjective task and suffers from a high degree of variability Thus it is a fair criterion to set as relevant not only the images of the same density class of the query image but also the images in the adjoining classes This is the approach used in this paper The same steps of the 002rst experiment were performed in this experiment In the training phase Omega algorithm reduced 34 of the feature vector size keeping only 56 of the original 85 features Apriori mined 30,996 association rules In the test phase the association rules and the features of test images were submitted to the ACE algorithm We measured the ability of IDEA in distinguishing a breast side  right breast or left breast  b type of the view medio-lateral oblique or cranio-caudal and c density level The values of accuracy obtained considering these parts of the diagnosis were Side 73.5  View 85.1  Density 94.8  Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the system when analyzing the image on the left of the screenshot Observe that the system suggests density 1 and 2 for the analyzed image However density=2 gets a higher value of weight than density=1 thus indicating that most likely the image is from

density=2 which is the density of the image that is in the specialist's report The system can suggest more than one diagnosis hypotheses to the radiologists work on However the hypotheses with a higher value of weight should be 002rstly considered by them Figure 5 Screenshot of the IDEA system The results of the Experiments 1 and 2 are very promising because they show a very small error rate regarding the main part of the diagnosis BI-RADS and density level for Experiments 1 and 2 respectively making the system more reliable 5 Conclusions In this paper we presented the IDEA approach based on association rules to assist the specialists in the task of image diagnosing IDEA encompasses four main steps feature extraction feature selection and discretization association rule mining and generation of diagnosis suggestions Two new algorithms were developed to support the method Omega and ACE Omega executes two tasks in a single step feature selection and supervised discretization The ACE algorithm generates diagnosis suggestions by assigning multiple keywords to a test image The results of using real datasets show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy up to 96.7 being more sensitive than speci\002c what is desirable in medical domain The radiologists demonstrated acceptance for the IDEA system showing enormous interest in employing the system to aid them in their daily work The IDEA method has an important characteristic that makes it different from other CAD methods it can suggest multiple diagnosis hypotheses for the same image and employs a measure of quality to rank them The results indicate the proposed method is very suitable for the task of suggesting diagnosis of medical images enhancing and bringing more con\002dence to the diagnosing process Acknowledgment We thank the Brazilian funding agencies FAPESP CAPES and CNPq References  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A  N Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In The ACM SIGMOD ICMD  1993  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Intl Conf on VLDB  1994  M Al-Shalalf a and R Alhajj A ttracti v e feature reduction approach for colon data classi\002cation In 21st Intl Conf on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops   M.-L Antonie O R Zaane and A Coman Associati v e classi\002ers for medical images In LNAI 2797 MMCD  pages 68–83 Springer-Verlag 2003  E.-L Chen P C Chung C.-L Chen H.-M T  A H.-M Tsai and C.-I C A C.-I Chang An automatic diagnostic system for ct liver image classi\002cation IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering  45\(6 1998  K Do i and H Huangb  Computer aid ed diagnosis cad and image-guided decision support Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics  31\(4-5 2007  S K Kinoshita P  M d Aze v edoMarques R R P  Jr  J A H Rodrigues and R M Rangayyan Contentbased retrieval of mammograms using visual features related to breast density patterns Journal of Digital Imaging  20\(2 2007  N Otsu A thresholding selection method from grayle v el histogram IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics  9:6266 1979  H P an J Li and Z W ei Mining interesting association rules in medical images In Advance Data Mining and Medical Applications   P  Perner  Image mining issu es frame w ork a gener ic tool and its application to medical-image diagnosis Engineering Applications of Arti\002cial Intelligence  15\(2 2002  S Quek C Thng J Khoo and W  K oh Radiologists detection of mammographic abnormalities with and without a computer-aided detection system Australasian Radiology  47\(3 2003  O T alak oub J Alirezaie and P  Babyn Lun g se gmentation in pulmonary ct images using wavelet transform In J Alirezaie editor Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing 2007 ICASSP 2007 IEEE Intl Conf on  volume 1 pages I–453–I–456 2007  X W ang M Smith and R Rang ayyan Mammograp hic information analysis through association-rule mining In IEEE CCGEI  pages 1495–1498 2004  J Y a o J Li and R Summers Ct colonograph y computer aided polyp detection using topographical height map In J Li editor IEEE Intl Conf on Image Processing  volume 5 pages V  21–V  24 2007  W L Zhang and X.-Z W ang Feature e x traction and classi\002cation for human brain ct images In X.-Z Wang editor Intl Conf on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  volume 2 pages 1155–1159

This is indeed a revolutionary concept in the fields of exploration and development of petroleum fields, which has more future scope of commercial research 2 Data instances from CDP, COP, CRP, CSP dimensions can easily be structured and integrated in a warehouse environment for the purpose of interpreting seismic signals and their attributes as required by geologists, well planners, reservoir and production engineers 3 Framing of business rules, constraints among usage of attributes within th e integration process and design of business rules have definite impact on correlation and mapping and thus on data mining 4 Ontology based data structuring has definite advantage, especially when attributes and their relationships are conceptualized using appropriate semantics and contexts 5 Integrating on tologically structured data in a warehousing environment has more flexibility and consistency in attribute mapping and interpretation during data mining stage 6 Structural data views taken from implemented warehoused metadata fo llow definite structure shapes, in terms of seismic high and low data instances, depicting geological knowledge 7 Integration of exploratio n data, modeled from different hierarchically derived multiple dimensions; facilitate the data mining process thus extracting knowledge of commercial petroleum plays. Issues of reuse and interoperability of denormalized fine-grained exploration data structures have also been emphasized in the context of implementing ontology based warehousing in petroleum exploration industries This research work addresses new methodologies, which have the potential to revolutionize the exploration and resources industries worldwide This is an on-going commercial research work at Curtin Business School Curtin University of Tech nology, Au stralia.

and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
