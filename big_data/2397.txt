The results show that: the residents 222 income gap of our country is large the Gini coefficient has exceeded the warning line, th e per capita income of households and the income gap is quite different because of the differences in urban and rural areas and regions, and the basic characteristics and human capital of the head of household; the residents 222 income gap at this stage is be yond a reasonable boundary trading for money and power, rent seeking and corruption" is the main reason for the widening of income gap; residents 222 affordability to the widening income gap is strong, but they are not satisfied with the state of the income  distribution; the main possible consequence caused by the aggravation of income distribution inequity is "the increase in the  degree of social instability"; "the initial distribution and redistribution should handle the relationship between efficiency and  equity, with particular emphasis on equity of redistribution"; compared with urban residents education", "social security" and "public infrastructure are the main feature s of unfairness to rural residents corrupt officials" and "big wealth gap" are the main factors and risks affecting social stability and hi ndering    Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China  71173189\, the Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Higher Ph.D. class topics \(20123326110003\ and the Soft Science Research Project of Zhejiang Province 2012C35018  the economic efficiency  ban illegal incomes, punish corruption" is the most important measure of promoting  fair distribution and narrowing the income gap. On this basis, this article puts  forward the corresponding policy recommendations  Keywords income gap moderation, questionnaire survey, Gini Coefficient, fairness, efficiency   1 Introduction  The moderation problem of income gap is not only the problem of efficiency and fairness on economics, but also related to the s ocial harmony and stability. Moderate income gap is beneficial to improving the production efficiency and optimizing the allocation of resources However, if the income gap is too large and the tendency of broadening can 222 t be suppressed, it is likely to affect the sustained economic growth and social stability and equity 1 Since the reform and opening, with the sustained and rapid economic growth, the income level of residents in China continues to rise up and the quality of life improves significantly, while the residents 222 income gap is broadening unceasingly. Hence, the theoretical and empirical research on the income gap moderation can reveal the nature and crux of the problem of income gap  and is helpful in the search for the countermeasures to narrow the income gap of residents, which has very important theoretical significance and practice value for the government to establish scientific and reasonable income distribution policy, to regulate and control the income gap  effectively and to promote the harmonious develop ment of economy and society  There are a few related researches about the moderation problem of resident income gap at home and aboard. The main viewpoints are as follows o n the connotation of income gap m oderation, the research group from the Academy of Macroeconomic Research of the State Planning Commission  2001,2002  2][3  made whether it would stimulate economic growth and the public subjective endurance level as two basic principles to judge income gap  moderation. Shen Shibo 2005   thinks, the moderate income gap is the gap with a Gini coefficient that in an appropriate interval, neither too big   20 13  International Conference on Management Science & Engineering 20 th   July 17-19, 2013  Harbin P.R.China 


   1075   nor too small. Fan Lishu 2005 5 thinks that the moderate income gap should be compatible with a certain l evel and stage of economic development, not only can support or promote the sustainable economic development, but also is conduc t ive to social stability and advancement. Wen Kui and Ren Hongyan 2007 6 think, the influence of income gap on the social and economic system is embodied in two aspects of efficiency and fairness the  understanding of  the  relationship  between  efficiency and fairness  is  the  benchmark  of  income  gap moderation Li Jiong and Zhang Ying 2007 7]93 think, reasonable income gap refers t o the existence and expansion of income gap can produce productive efforts and economic growth motivation, on the contrary the existence or expansion  of  the  income gap  is  not  associated  with  the  element contribution  even  deviates from the  performance  pri nciple of distribution  it is unreasonable  income gap Liu Chengli 2008   think, fairness and efficiency are the common standards to draft distribution policy and measure the allocation effect. Wang Shaoguo and Chang Jian\(2010 9 consider, the most mode rate income gap always  corresponds to a certain stage, at different stages of development, the most moderate income gap will develop and change, which will form a social trajectory of the most moderate income gap. Sun Jinshui and Huang Yuanyuan 2012  10 c onsider resident s\222 income gap moderation  refers to the  income gap  which is in coordination  with the  economic  growth  resource allocation  fair  distribution of income  and  social stability in  a certain period of time  within a certain range  On the judgment  and evaluation of the income gap moderation of residents at the present stage of our country, scholars have various views with big differences The main viewpoints are as follows: Chen Zongsheng and Zhou Yunbo\(2002 11 deem, the income gap of our country is moderate, although the income gap in both absolute gap, or gap expanded, but income levels are generally improving, the social order is stable, so this gap is recognized at present. Li Jiong and Zhang Ying  2007 7]89-94 think that our country has not a ppeared polarization, at least only can be regarded as a differentiation. Wang Shaoguo and Wang Zhen 2009   have made empirical test of moderate level of the gap between urban and rural, and results show that the income gap between urban and rural in China has deviated from the moderate level, which must be adjusted. Zhao Renwei and Li Shi\(1999 13 consider that Chinese residents 222 income gap shows the trend of full expansion, the Gini coefficient has already exceeded the reasonable range, if not being a dministrated timely China may appear polarization to affect social stability Zeng Guoan\(2003 14 thinks that China 222 s G ini coefficients, looking from stat  ic transverse, has exceeded the internationally recognized warning line of the unequal distributi on, showing that the income gap has "deteriorated" properties from the  perspective  of  vertical development distribution conditions  deteriorate further  with  the  deepening of the process of marketization   Xu Xianxiang and  Wang Haigang  2008  15 investigat ed the evolution  of  income distribution  of  the  country  in  the  initial distribution, and discovered that our residents 222 factor income grew generally but in the growth process, low income residents 222 income growth was slow, high income 222 s was rapid, showing the polarization. Sun Jinshui and Dong Lifeng 222s 2012    study shows that our country 222 s resident income gap showed a tendency to expand from 1990 to 2010, the state of income gap in general is not appropriate or not appropriate basically  In general, the researches in academic circle are more about the current situation, cause and influence  at present  but less about the problem of resident income gap moderation, most of them limit to theoretical research  and the empirical analysis is  relatively weak  lack ing of  first hand  research  information  dedicated  questionnaire survey  and quantitative investigation what 222 s more, there is almost no literatures based on extensive  research data about the statistical analysis  and evaluation of the  problem of resident inc ome gap moderation. Therefore, we organize this questionnaire survey of residents 222 income gap moderation. On one hand, the survey data obtain ed can help us to carry out statistical analysis and assessment on residents 222 income gap moderation issues; on the other hand, it can also provide reference for government to formulate corresponding policies  Overall, the most research of academia is about the status, causes and effects of the income gap, and it 222 s enriched our understanding of the income gap problem b ut most of the existing research is limited to the meso or macro level, and its main limitation is not to detect hidden micro level factors which behind these economic issues. The use of survey data, in depth analysis from the microscopic individual factor s on the income gap is relatively rare, however, micro data covering the detailed behavior of decision makers information, easy to dig more fundamental factors in empirical research. The research of income gap requires high quality survey data but it 222 s di fficult to obtain such kind of data due to various reasons. These data are difficult to reflect the rapidly changing realities even if we 222 ve gotten some representative data, because our country is in a period of economic and social transformation, economic  structure has also undergone some new changes. A certain impact on the social, economic and political changes in the pattern of income and the income gap, but because of there is no new first hand survey data, research in these areas is less, and timeline ss is not strong. This is the topic what our paper need to study  The existing research on the moderation of the i nc ome gap is few, and it 222 s mainly limited to theoretical research. Empirical analysis is relatively weak, because its lack of first hand resea rch data, specialized survey and quantify the investigation, and there almost no paper which based on extensive research data on the moderation issues of the income gap related to statistical analysis and evaluation. Satisfaction from aspects of the

Based on the survey results, we conclud ed six corresponding policy recommendations, providing an important reference for government departments to develop appropriate po licies. And the content which mentioned above is the innovation point and the difference between the existing researches   2 Research methods and survey samples  2.1 Research methods  In the long term, theoretical circles form a lot of analytical methods an d indicators to measure the gap in studying the income distribution. Evaluation indexes includ e the s tandard d eviation, the C oefficient of V ariation, the Gini coefficient, Theil index, Atkinson index and Kuznets ratio  these indicators have their own chara cteristics and have different emphases in practical applications. Theoretical circles used the C oefficient of V ariation, the Gini coefficient and Theil index to measure the income gap on the basis of five properties of Anonymity i ndependence  Population T ransfer Principle Strong Lorentz c onsistency Wan, 2004  And this is the measure ment  which is used in this paper  1 Coefficient of Variation \(CV The formula is     1 1 2 n i i y n CV         1  which n  is the  number of samples i y  is the  individual income  of  ith  sample n i i y n 1 1  is the average income on all samples  2 Gini coeffi cient  Gini  coefficient  was  first proposed by Gini in 1910 and was given in the form of a conti nuous function, but the process of the  data in practical applications  is ofte n discrete individuals, this article propose s the following formula by Sen \(1973          n i i yin nn G 1 2 1 21 1   2  3 Generalized Entropy index  GE  Theil \(1967   19 applied the concept of entropy into the inequality meas ure.

   1079   EViews6.0, we have regression results shown in Tab.3 In Tab.3, model 1, model 2 1, model 2 2, model 3 and model 4, which reflect the impact of basic characteristics the individual human capital \(education, culture degree institutional factors  dual structure of rural urban and regional differences on the family annual income The regression coefficients of all variables have the expected sign, the variables all have higher statistical significance and the regression equation of the goodness of fit is high after eliminating heteroscedasticity. In addition, the influencing fac tors can explain the family annual per capita income in more than 99%, the results are satisfactory  4.2.1 Analysis based on the results of regression  1\Effects of basic characteristics of the personal on annual income of the family  Model 1 results show t hat the basic characteristic of the individual has a significant impact on the average annual family income. In the other factors remain unchanged, the male head of the household income is 10.52  higher than that of the female head. In our country, gender  discrimination has been watered down but we can not ignore the impact on residents 222 income The physiological differences between men and women and traditional concepts are difficult to eradicate, explicit discrimination has weakened, but the invisible d iscrimination is still widespread. Annual per capita income of Chinese households is 62.58% higher than that of minority residents, which may be related to ethnic minorities living in remote areas. The coefficient of age to lny is 0.0152, square coefficien t is 0.0002, shows that with each additional year of work experience, income increases 1.53%. Effect of age on the income of residents has obvious nonlinear effect showing a clear inverted U" type relationship, this shows that along with the increase of the age, the income has a diminishing marginal effect. Family size and annual per capita income of family shows a significant negative correlation namely increasing per person, per capita family income decreased by 23.19%. Overall, the national feature ow ns the highest rate of income, followed by family size and age feature owns the minimum rate among the basic characteristics of the individual  2\Effect of human capital on the annual income of the family  The unbalanced development of education has become  an important factor in further widening income gap. There is significant difference effect of educational factor on income level in different regions, urban and rural, unit, and family. In order to verify the judgment of importance of the human capital de ciding income, we conduct quantitative analysis of income gap caused by the difference of human capital in our country  Model 2 1 in Tab.3 shows that, years of education has a significant positive effect on the annual per capita     Note  linear models, the influence degree of explanatory variables to dependent variables is e 1\ \327 100%, hereinafter the same  income of family, the education years for every increase of 1 year, the average annual family income will increase 9.31%. In order to compare different culture degrees impacting family income, we take primary school and below as reference, using culture degree dummy variables instead of education years. The results are shown in Tab.3 model 2 2. The result shows that the average annual family income gradually increases with schooling increases. Person with higher level of education owns higher production capacity and configuration abi lity, as its reinforced mechanism, the ability to earn income will be further enhanced Specifically, the family income of householders with junior middle school, high school or technical secondary school, junior College, university, and graduate education  are 54.70%, 96.56%, 130.48%, 186.42 200.51% higher than primary school and below respectively  In human capital theory, with the cultural level increase, the individual rate of return to education has increased significantly, and the increasing rate is  rising By the regression results we can draw a consistent conclusion, higher education income rate is higher than that of secondary education and elementary education and the difference becomes larger and larger. This indicates that the income gap betwe en the university or above education group and other education groups appeared a widening trend. Therefore, years of schooling and education have become increasingly important influence factors on income of our country dweller and income gap. Cultural degr ee increase the rate of return reflecting China 222 s income distribution system reformation led to increase in knowledge gains from the side, but also reflects the society emphasis of knowledge education on the increase  3\Effect of institutional factors du al structure of rural urban on the annual income of the family  Model 3 in Tab.3 shows that institutional factors  dual structure of rural urban have a significant effect on the average annual family income, the income of urban residents is 78.09% higher than that of rural residents Continuing expanding the level of per capita income gap between urban and rural residents in China is an important cause of widening income gap of residents However the gap between urban and rural areas is largely caused by t he institutional and policy factors, such as income distribution system, social security system and the household registration system, etc.. The most prominent manifestation of China 222 s social inequality is the dual social structure of rural urban. The urba nrural system divides the 1.3 billion population into two social groups of inequality. With the rapid development of the technology progress and economy, the marginal productivity of urban residents increased determines the corresponding rising of income level. However, simple agricultural production occupies the main position in the rural areas, and the existence of a large number of rural surplus labor as well as the limited agricultural resources determines the rural low income residents

This implies  that the matter of unfairness of educational resources distribution needs to be resolved as soon as possible only in this way can we make contribution to solve the income gap between urban and rural areas. Secondly, we should pay sufficient attention to social security and public infrastructure. As the results above consistent with the situation of our country, the factors of social security imperfect coverage, backwardness of public in frastructure in rural areas are still the  causes of  the  income gap between urban and rural areas  which can not be ignored  57.85 60.77 55.15 39.01 38.52 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Social security Education Public infrastructure Emp loy ment discrimination Household registration system  Fig.6 Main feature s of unfairness of rural residents compared with urban residents at present   5 7 Relationship between fairness an d efficiency currently  Obs erving the result  of the national questionnaire  survey statistics, for the relationship between fairness and efficiency currently, the proportion of selecting  the relationship between efficiency and equity in the initial distribu tion and redistribution should be handled properly, with particular emphasis on equity in redistribution  is 34.62  ranking the first, followed by  efficiency and fairness promote each other and should be paid equal attention  27.71%\ and  efficiency and  fairness cannot coexist  fair priority is more important   14.73%\ \(see Fig.7\.

A statistic analysis and evaluation is conducted on the basic judgment for the appropriateness of residents\222 income gap at the present stage, main reasons and the public endurance for the enlarging of the gap, the public satisfaction for income distribution situation, the potential consequences for the aggravated unfair income distribution, the current relations between the fairness and efficiency, the most important way for the distribution fairness, the main manifestations of rural residents\222 unfairness, the major factors and risks affecting social stability and economic efficiency and the key policy to promote fair distribution. The following are the research conclusions an d its related policy implications   6.1 Research conclusions  Conclusion 1 The income gap of our residents is large, and Gini coefficient has exceeded the cordon Because of the differences on disparities among regions, urban and rural areas, the householde rs\222 essential features and the human capital, there are greater differences on the average income of residents\222 family and the income gap The results of questionnaire survey indicate that the average per capita income of the urban family is higher than th at of rural residents, while the rural residents\222 income gap is higher than that of urban residents; the average per capita income of family and the income inequality in eastern China are higher than those in central and western China the average per capi ta income of the Han family and the income gap are higher than that of the family of ethnic minority; the average per capita income in the families headed by males and the income gap are higher than that of the families headed by females. The relationship between the age of householder and the family\222s average per capital income presents an inverted U shape, which is smaller on two sides and larger on middle, besides, the residents\222 income gap between 51 and 60 years old is the largest. From the perspective  of educational background there are positive correlations between the average family income and the educational background of the house  holders. Also there is an inverted U shape relationship between the educational background of the householders and th e average family income gap  Conclusion 2 The current income gap of residents surpasses rational limit  The result of questionnaire survey shows that 60% of the residents think that the current income gap of residents has surpassed rational limit  Conclusi on 3 "The transactions between power and money, rent seeking and corruption" is the main cause of the enlarging of residents\222 income gap at present  The questionnaire research has revealed that transactions between power, money, rent seeking and corruption the imperfect social insurance system          67.69 45.61 53.71 52.24 34.22 65.53 43.60 52.75 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Ban illegal incomes, punish corruption Eliminate monopoly, establish a fair competitive market environment Improve the tax system, give full play to the tax adjustment function Gain efforts to narrow the income gap between urban and rural residents Improve the level of public goods distribution and the balance of allocation Improve the social security system, gain efforts to help low-income groups Guarantee the equality of the starting point and opportunity Establish a mechanism for regular p ay increases  Fig.10 Policy focus on promoting fair distribution 


   1084   unfair opportunity of the individual", "trade monopoly and "the invalid policies and measures to improve the situation of fair distribution" are the most im portant reasons for the current enlarging of residents\222 income gap. These are the first five reasons selected by respondents, while other reasons are less selected  Conclusio n 4 Residents 222 endurance to the widening of income gap is stronger, but most resid ents are not satisfied with the current income distribution situation  The outcome of questionnaire survey reveals that more than 50% residents think that they can endure the lagering of income gap at present W hereas, more than 50% of them are not satisfi ed with the current income distribution situation  Conclusion 5 "The increasing society instability is potentially the main consequence resulted from the aggravated unfairness of income distribution  offic i al corruption" and "big gap between rich and poo r" are the major factors and risks affecting social stability and economic efficiency The result s of question naire survey indicate  that ove r a half residents think that "the inc reasing of social stability the growing of public 222 s dissatisfa ction the intensifying of social differentiation" and " the dropping of policy prestige" are the top 4 potential consequences for the aggravated unfairness of income distribution, while fe w of them chose the result of the slowing of economic development speed" and " the frequent social crowd acting  According to the result of the questionnaire survey more than a half respondents choose "polarization of wealth", "official corruption" and "unemployment conditions" as the first three main factors affecting the soci al stability at present; few of them choose the fac tors of "currency inflation state of poverty" and "security of society  Conclusion 6  The relationship between equity and efficiency should be balanced both in the primary distribution and redistribution, and more emphasis should be put on equity in redistribution"; compared with the urban residents, the inequity for the rural residents mainly manifests in "education", "social security", and "public infrastructure serv ice  As to the current relationship between equity and efficiency most respondents agree that "the relationship between equity and efficiency should be balanced both in the primary distribution and redistribution, and mo re emphasis should be put on equity in redistribution". In general, the majority of residents point out that the  cake should not only be made bigger but distributed well. In contrast, people pay more attention on equity than efficiency. The result of questionnaire survey shows that more than 50% residents think that compared with the urban residents, the inequity for the rural residents mainly manifests in "education", "social security" and public infrastructure service", and few of them choose househo ld system" and "employment discrimination  Conclusion 7  Banning illegal and abnormal income, and punishing the corruption" is the most important measure to improve fair distribution and narrow the income gap The outcome of questionnaire survey reveals that over half of the respondents consider banning illegal and abnormal income, a nd punishing the corruption building up a perfect social security system and strengthening the supp ort for low income group" and  perfecting the tax system, giving the fu ll play to the adjusting role of tax" as the leading three policies to promote fair distribution. However, few respo ndents choose the policies of establishing the normal gr owth mechanism of the wages", "trying to narrow down the income disparity between urban and rural residents eliminating the monopoly, establishing market environment with fair competition", "ensuring the fairness of the starting point and the equity of opportunity" and " improving the supply level of public goods and the proportionali ty of distribution", which are ranked behind the former three policies   6 2  Policy implications  1  E xpand the cake  and w ell distribute it keep paying attention on efficiency and maintain the fairness The result of questionnaire survey indicates that th e income gap of our residents is large, and Gini coefficient has exceeded the cordon; for the relationship between equity and efficiency, most residents hope that it should be well handled both in the primary distribution and redistribution, and more emphasis should be put on equity in redistribution. The cake should be expanded and well distributed at the same time; while the cake is well distributed, it should be made bigger and better   Because of the stages of ec onomic development, it requires different policy choice orientations towards equity and efficiency. In the early stages of economic development, the distributable cake  is small due to the small scale economy, so the cake  should be made bigger firstly, and then it can come to be distributed. The bigger the  cake the more people will be distributed. When the economy develops into a considerable level, the distributable cake  has formed a considerable scales and a certain distribution pattern which leads to the  unfairness of income distribution has been established, the adjustment of distribution structure becomes more important. With the development of more than 30 years the economy grows increasingly, and the resident s\222 income level and living quality has imp roved obviously our country has fallen in a crucial stage of constructing a well being society. Currently, there still exits some urgent and troubl esome issues in income distribution namely, the devel o pment of urban rural area is still in biggish gap, th e issue of substandard income distribution order, invisible income and illegal income is obvious 23  In this case, the expanding and the distribution of the cake should be taken in harmony. The enthusiasm of the workers to make a bigger cake  should be sti mulated and the cake  should be properly distributed around the people 222 s liveli hood so as to realize the social fairness and harmonious develo pment. Whether to expand or to well distribute the  cake its ultimate goal lies in that the 


   1085   people enjoy together a ll the development achievements The inherent requirement for the construction of socialistic harmonious society is that more attention should be paid to fairness on the basis of economy development and efficiency improvement    2  Ban illegal and abnormal income, eliminate the rent seeking and punish the corruption, regulate the gray income to promote the income information open and transparent The result of questionnaire survey indicates that "the transactions between power and money rent seeking and c orruption" has become the main cause of the enlarging of resident 222 s income gap in most people 222 s heart at present. "Banning illegal and abnormal income  and punishing the corruption" is the leading policy for the promotion of fair distribution. Therefore to  ban illegal and abnormal income, eliminate the rent seeking and punish the corruption resolutely is the key link for the regulation of income distribution. People are not satisfied with the enlarging of income gap  as a matter of fact  they are mainly not  satisfied with the huge wealth obtained by illegal and irregular act. Hence, all kinds of illegal income should be severely punished; the hole of the reform of state owned enterprise, Land Grant System and exploitation of mineral resources should be plugg ed; commerce bribery should be deeply governed The illegal activities, like power rent seeking, collusion between government officials and businessmen corruption, smuggling, insider transactions, manipulation of stock market, manufacturing and selling fakes, fraud of loan and foreign exchange, should be severely attacked  The definition of political rights and market power should be clear. The expansion and abuse of the political rights should be prevented in order to maintain the market fairness, try to drop out the political rights out primary distribution. It is necessary to further regulate the gray income, such as cash gifts, red envelopes appearance fees, favor fees and all kinds of welfare cu t of f the channels of gray income. Open and transparent income information is the premise to strengthen supervision and promote fair distribution. The establishment of the data  base for income information should be accelerated includ ing the citizen 222 s personal data, income, property, housing, and so on. The sy stem of individual payment and settlement should be built advance the settlement system of resident 222 s fixed account credit card and check, promote computerized transactions. To boost the open  ness and transparence of income information, the super  vision  functions of the public and press needs to work effectively and the resident 222 s right to  be  informed should be respected. If one 222 s income and family burden is trans  parent, the gray and illegal income will hide nowhere and tax evasion will lost space 24  3 Break up the dual structures, and promote regio nal, urban and rural economy coordination development The outcome of questionnaire survey reveals that the average per capita income of the urban family is higher than that of rural family, while the rur al residents 222 income gap is higher than that of urban residents; the average per capita income of family in eastern China is higher than that in central and western China. The economic discrepancy between rural and urban areas, region is obvious, because the market role in allocation of resources between rural and urban areas particularly among regions is restricted by the dual economic structure, and the resources concentrate on large and medium sized city or developed area. To narrow the income gap, firstly, it needs to reduce the restriction for the population flow by household system try to eliminate its barrier and all kinds of obstacles for the labor mobility, let the manpower flow freely between rural and urban areas, and regions, offer equal employ ment opportunity for the urban rural population and make the rural workers normally enjoy the public service of city 222 s education and medical treatment. On one hand, it can improve the rural residents 222 income, overall plan the resources between urban and rural areas; on the other hand, it is helpful for the transfer of rural surplus labor force and the reasonable flow of human resources between urban and rural areas. Secondly, great efforts should be taken to construct the rural infrastructure and narrow dow n its gap with  urban areas. The rural infrastructure tends to be underdeveloped, and it is not only difficult to solve the problem by depending on market but impossible by relying on its own accumulation. Therefore, to improve the income of rural residents  and narrow the income gap between urban and rural areas, it is necessary to strengthen the infrastructure construction in poor rural areas and to promote the equalization of their infrastructure and basic public service. Thirdly, the transfer from agricul tural labor to nonagricultural one should be facilitated, more employment opportunities, nonagricultural ones in particular, should be offered to the rural surplus labor force in order to improve the farmer 222 s nonagricultural income. Meanwhile, the governme nt can encourage the urban enterprise to employ the rural residents by the policies of tax preference and finance so that the income of rural residents will increase in a large scale and the income gap between rural and urban areas will narrow down  The key point to solve the issue of regional income disparities is to harmonize the regional economic development, give full play to their comparative advantages and form the pattern of complementary advantage, mutual promotion and development. The government s hould strengthen the policy support for underdeveloped areas, realize the rational gradient transfer from developed areas to less developed areas by the necessary transfer payment and industry guide, lead the capital and talents to flow to less developed a rea so as to raise its economic development level, increase the resident 222 s income and narrow the income gap between residents in developed areas   Meanwhile, it needs to increase the policy support for remote areas and minority areas, try to reduce the ba sic condition disparities of the development of 


   1086   economic society in these areas, promote their own competitiveness  so as to achieve the goal of narrowing the income gap 25  4  Strengthen the help system for low income group and vulnerable groups, ensure every worker 222 s rights and interests to participate in the economic  activities fairly, establish perfect minimum living standard security system for the poor population and medical aid system Result of research indicates that the average per capita income and the income gap in the families headed by males are higher than that of the families headed by females. With the advance of marketization, labor force production factor is strongly influenced by survival of the fittest in market. Male worker has more ad vantages than female worker in market competition and his degree of participation is higher, so his income must increase more than the female worker and it leads to the enlarging of income inequality At present, the government has carried out many definit e regulations on the protection of employment equity for women and vulnerable groups, and the work focuses on further perfecting these policy measures and paying more attention on supervision, make sure that each system is really implemented and every work er has the right and interests to participate in the business activities fairly  The outcome of questionnaire reveals that more than 60% of the respondents select "perfect the social security system, and strengthen the help system for low income group" as the key policy to promote fair distribution. It fully proves that the system of social security and social assistance plays an important role in the adjustment of resident 222 s income distribution Currently, the poor population, rural poor population in part icular, mainly concentrate on the areas with poor geographical environment, remote areas, minority  areas old liberated areas and  remote mountain areas. The population quality in these areas is not high, the opportunity and ability to shake of poverty and obtain development is limited, so it is necessary for the government to innovate continually in helping the poor and find a new way. The government should increase financial input for the poor areas and poor population strengthen the help system for low income groups and vulnerable groups, establish perfect minimum living standard security system for the poor pop ulation and medical aid system  reduce the incidence rates of poverty make low income groups and vulnerable groups share the achievements of economic developments. With the increasing growth of economy, the social security system enjoyed by the whole society with different regions, ages genders and occupations should be gradually established While the governm ent attaches the importance on the wor k of living assistance, it should strengthen the poverty relief and the develop ment, take more effective measures, improve their self  developing ability, change the support for poverty from transfusion to creation develop production according to the loca l conditions foster and enlarge the advantage  industry and characteristic economy in poor areas, strengthen the hematopoiesis functions increasingly, improve their ability of self accumulation and self development, speed up the steps to eliminate poverty  5  Complete the tax system, intensify taxation supervision and regulate the excessively high income The result of questionnaire survey indicates that more than half of the respondents consider "perfecting the tax system and giving full play to the adjustment function of fax  as the crucial policy to promote fair distribution. It fully shows that the taxation plays a critical role  in the adjustment of residents 222 income distribution In our country, the redistribution function of tax should be further enha nced. However, there exist many problems in our country 222 s tax system. The tax system of individual income, consumption and property is not perfect. Besides the inheritance tax, gift tax and social security tax have not been levied yet. In addition, the in dividual income tax is levied by classification, the management system is incom plete and supervision is poor. Because of these, the function of tax to adjust the distribution of income is weakened. Thus, to give full play to the tax function of adjusting t he distribution of income, it is necessary to buil d and perfect the tax system and management system which are beneficial for the adjustment of the distribution of income. The individual income tax should be adjusted reasonably and timely in line with the change of resident s\222 wages price  of  commodities basic living costs etc. The government should pay more attention on the tax levying and regulation, severely punish the be havior of tax evasion. The management and supervision of tax from monopolized industry and high income people should be well done in particular for the effective adjustment of the excessively high income. As for the regulation of high income, the method of  individual income tax should be used and overseas experiences should also be borrowed. The inheritance tax gift tax, social security tax and the special consumption tax should be levied earlier for the regulation  6  Develop education greatly, intensify  the equity of education opportunity, enhance the workers 222 skill and level of human capital  The outcome of questio nnaire reveals that the higher education level is, the more the average family income will be; there is an inverted Ushape relationship between the educational income gap; the higher education level is, the stronger the endurance to the widening of income gap will be and the more satisfied people are with the income distribution situation. It proves that education, as the important resources for human capital, plays an increasingly important role in the promotion of economic development, and the increase of knowledge yield is well reflected in the reform of income distribution system Because of the dual labor market, the labor force with lower  education mainly work in the traditional labor market and the supply o f labor force exceeds demand due  to the lack of skill. The fierce market competition leads to the low income of the labor force   The modern labor market requires skilled labor force so the labor force with higher education mainly work here and their 


   1087   income is also higher. Besides, the demand of labor force exceeds the supply or they are in balance. The important measures to narrow the income gap are the following intensify the equity of education opportunity; increase the input of public expenditure on education; add the inves tment of human capital further, especially for the low income groups so as to offer equal education opportunity to every worker. Therefore, the government shou ld expand the expenditure in education, especial in the areas of less developed, poverty and minority so that residents in these areas will enjoy the same education  Education will enhance the worker s\222 quality and skills increase the knowledge content and  creativity of labor and raise the income. To satisfy the demand of increasingly trans  forming the way of economic development and adjusting economy structure vocational education, skill training and further education should be paid more attention to improve the labor 222 s quality and skill. It is beneficial to promote labor factor fluxion in market, overcome structural unemployment increase the labor 222 s income and narrow the income gap   References   1 un  Jing shui, D ong  Li feng.

  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar. The H1RG is the current generation of the HAWAII series and the TIMS FPA is first generation Comparison is given in table 6. The newer generation has improved pixel to pixel uniformity Table 6.

To achieve high SNR in low light conditions a 4.08s exposure \(or stare time is used. For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two. The resulting E/W scan rate is 2400 km per observing hour and facilitates mapping of  the gases CO 2 CH 4 and CO with 2.7 km sample spacing on continental size regions several times per day The optical design code, using actual tolerances as have been achieved in previous LM ATC space instrument builds predicts spatial resolutions per sample of 4.1 km NS and 5.4 km EW Per 4.08s stare time twelve consecutive spectral images or frames, with 340 ms integration times are acquired and coadded per pixel to a 1024  x 1024 buffer array. The coadded buffer comprises the spectral image that is reported to telemetry.  Correlated double sampling \(CDS\used per each of the 12 frames. In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively. This measurement set is capable of providing break through reduction of uncertainty and attribution for the sources of CO 2 CH 4 and CO within the large geostationary field of regard of the geoCARB References 1  J.
