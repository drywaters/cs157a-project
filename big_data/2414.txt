different markets To date although many market segmentation methods have been proposed the problem of service policy making for different segmented markets is still not well addressed In this paper the service policy making problem is 036rst modeled as a multi-criteria decision problem and then an analytic network process ANP based method is proposed to solve the problem Finally a case study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and method 
I I NTRODUCTION Customers in today\222s marketplace are more demanding not just of product quality but also of service The companies have to offer better customer service to remain competitive 
and pro\036table One focus of supply chain management SCM is increasingly turning towards to provide better services A clear service policy is of primary importance in supply chain design operation and optimization Service is a multi-faceted concept which consists of many factors The diversity of customer requirements has driven the enterprises to provide versatile services As a result it is cursory to provide standard service to all the customers However it is impossible and unadvisable to meet all the customers\222 service demands An effective way is to segment the customers and adopt different service policies for each market segment Jonker presents a Markov decision model to determine the optimal mailing policy for each segment 
Based on the data mining results Lin discusses the electronic catalog design policy for each market Y u proposes a h ybrid mining approach and the classi\036cation and association rules are used to design returns policies and marketing strategies  Most of the r esearches concentrate on making mark et policies and the problem of service policy making for different segmented markets is still not well addressed With the increased importance of customer service many researchers have proposed new methods to study supply chain optimization using service level as constraint Most of these methods consider service policy as increasing the 223order 036ll rate\224 while ignore the multivariate nature of service and the 
market differentiation This excessive simpli\036cation can not give an exact description to the real situation Overall the service policy research is very important in SCM In this paper we model customer service policy making problem as a multi-criteria decision problem on the basis of the segmented markets Our formulation incorporates many many factors of service such as the trade-off between service and cost The priorities of each service elements and the proportions of different service costs are assigned as the decision objects To handle the complicated relations between service elements and other factors in service process we employ the Analytic Network Process ANP to build the decision model 
ANP extends Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP to cases of dependence and feedbacks recently introduced Although AHP has been extensively investigated ANP has not been fully studied yet Some examples of ANP applications include re-engineering supply chain performance 8 logistics 9 business forecasting supplier selection 11 and project selection decisions The ANP method pro vides a more generalized model for decision-making It does not require the assumption on the independency between elements at different levels or the dependency between elements at the same level which is more suitable to the real situation In this paper we 036rst analyze the customer service elements and the relations between these elements and other factors in supply chain 
operation Then we propose an ANP model of service policy decision and develop its decision steps Through the operations of supermatrix we obtain the decision objects The remainder of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 the relations between service and other factors are indicated and the service elements are summarized In Section 3 the ANP model for service policy decision and the decision steps are proposed In Section 4 an application example in Auto Supply Chain is provided Conclusion is given in Section 5 II C USTOMER SERVICE ANALYSIS IN SCM SCM can be de\036ned as a set of approaches used to ef\036ciently integrate suppliers manufacturers warehouses and

retail stores so that merchandise is produced and distributed in the right quantities to the right location at the right time and at optimal cost Ob viously  product quantity  customer  time and cost are the 036ve main factors in the service process The relations between these factors are shown in Fig.1 The goal of customer service is to meet the customers\222 multi-faceted demands In SCM 223customer\224 and 223product\224 are the key components of service since customers initiated 1

demand variety and the Customer Products in 222A\222 category Products in 222B\222 category Products in 222C\222 category Spare parts in 222B\222 category Spare parts in 222C\222 category Proportion

rate Product inventory cost Product transportation cost Spare part transportation cost with service are listed in 223Cost\224 cluster It must be pointed out that only the main elements in each cluster are listed to avoid that the primary elements is diluted by too many unimportant elements in decision process Making service policy for a certain market is to decide the priorities of each service elements and the proportions of different service costs Using the six clusters we can describe the characteristics of each market and the relations between the market and the customer service Such characteristics and relations provide a solid foundation for the service policy making The decision process is shown in Fig 2 According to Fig 2 the characteristics of service policy making problem include 1 The decisions are multi-objective 2 The decision objects related to many elements which have complexity interactions 3 The history business data the customers\222 opinion and the business strategies should be consulted in the decision process Thus it is a human-involved multi-cluster multi-criteria Product The core of service The foundation of service Service differentiation To provide right products, to the right product in the right quantity, at the right time and at optimal cost Changed with different service Customer  taxonomy three categories are used to differentiate the importance of different customers products and spare parts In 223Time service\224 cluster the elements are the main service facets related to time and in 223Quantity service\224 the elements are the main service facets related to quantity Due to the demand uncertainty emergent service elements are considered in both 223time\224 and 223quantity\224 clusters The cost elements which have very close relations TABLE I C LUSTERS AND ELEMENTS Five main factors of service process in SCM  D1 D2 D3 P1 P2 P3 S1 S2 S3 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Sale cycle Spare part OOS cost rule the service should be different in 223Quantity\224 and 223Time\224 dimensions for different combinations of customer and product For example the combination of 223VIP customer\224 and 223key product\224 the service requires high level in both 223Quantity\224 and 223Time\224 dimensions while the combination of 223small customer\224 and 223general product\224 223Quantity\224 service may places more priorities on 223Quantity\224 than 223Time\224 The aim of SCM is to maximize the revenue by keeping the supply chain costs low There are several 036xed operational costs associated with a supply chain such as materials inventories transportation facilities technology and labor All the costs are used to provide service and make pro\036t 223Cost\224 is the foundation of service and the proportions of the cost elements change with different service For example to meet an important emergent demand products will be transported by air so the transportation cost will account for a large proportion of the total service costs while for general demands the inventory cost are the majority of service costs Thus the enterprises must optimize the service cost structure to provide better services for different demands with less cost Obviously service can not be isolated from the other factors The relations and interactions must be considered in service policy making process In this study the 036ve factors form the basis of customer service analysis Considering the increasing importance of maintenance service the 223Spare part\224 is also included as a special 223Product\224 As a result six clusters related to customer service in SCM are de\036ned and the elements of each cluster are listed in Table I According to the Spare part Time service T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T7 T8 Service Cost Spare part inventory cost Product OOS

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%. In Fig. 4, for the column of C1, there are M*cf 1 5*80%=4 elements whose values are T \(namely, S1, S2, S3, S5 Therefore, DCAR2: course\(Cno 004 1  student\(Sno 003 1  study\(Sno, Cno\olds. From Fig. 5, we know that DCAR3 and DCAR6 also hold. In Fig. 4, there are at least N*cf 2 4*75%=3 columns which have value T \(namely, in the column of C1 there is S1, in the column of C2 there is S1, in the column of C3 there is S2, in the column of C4 there is S5 therefore DCAR5: course\(Cno 003 1  student\(Sno 004 1  study\(Sno, Cno  VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as “for many”, “there are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logic”, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e composition”, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
