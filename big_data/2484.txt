whole data At last it calculates the min-support of these global candidate itemsets and generates globalfrequent itemsets for the whole data By dividing the massive data into a number of blocks it enhance generic application of algorithm Besides it increases algorithm efficiency that database scans is replaced by Bitset logical AND operation in each of block especially for massive remote sensing image data And the algorithm has been applied to remote sensing images Mining Association Rules Keywordsdata mining remote sensing image association rule partition Bitset 1 INTRODUCTION Association rule mining is one of important tasks in 
the area of data mining The initial application of association rule mining was on market basket data 1 An association rule is a relationship of the form X=>Y where X and Y are sets of items X is called the antecedent and Y the consequence An example of the rule can be customers who purchase an item X are very likely to purchase another item Y at the same time There are two primary quality measures for each rule support and confidence The rule X=>Y has support s in the transaction set D if s of transactions in D contains 
X and Y The rule has confidence c if c of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y The goal of association rule mining is to find all the rules that exceed user specified support and confidence thresholds.[2 The following are characteristics of association rule mining on remotely sensed imagery  In remotely sensed imagery each pixel can be considered as a transaction  Each transaction pixel has the same number of items which is the number of bands  Special types of association rules we are particularly interested in the kinds of rules where the left side of the rule 
is a combination of band intervals while the right side of the rule 978-1-4244-3531-9/08/$25.002008 IEEE Yongbin Liu2 2.Department of Computer Science University of Finance  Economics Tianjin China qingbin1iu\(l63.com is a particular interval of yield band For example B 1-low A B2-high A B3-mid  Y-high Where BI-low={Bandl,0-93 B2-high Band2,192-255  B3-mid={Band3 93-191 Y-high={Yield 192-255 Besides accessing to the huge volume of remote sensing data with a variety of remote sensing platform and development of sensor technology but it is difficult to carry out effective treatment Based on these characteristics we propose a new approach which partition massive 
remote sensing data into several independent blocks in which uses bitset to organize remote sensing data Efficiency is an important issue for a mining algorithm By using partition and bitset the association rule mining algorithm only scans transaction database twice with fast computation This paper is organized as follows 1 a TP-PB algorithm is described in Section 2 Experiment results and performance analysis are given in Section 3 Finally the TP-PB algorithm is applied to crop remote sensing image for association rules mining 2 TP-PB ALGORITHM Given a user specified minimum support minsup 
and confidence minconf the task is to find association rules where support and confidence are at least minsup and minconf This can be broken into two steps I Find all itemsets with support above minsup find all frequent item sets II For each frequent item set derive all rules that are supported by that set which have at least minconf That is given a frequent item set X find all antecedent subsets A of X such that rule R A 
 X-A has at least minconf Various improved algorithms have been proposed to discover correlations in large 
itemsets Most of them are variations of the Apriori Algorithm[3][4][5][6 Overall performance of association rules mining is largely determined by the first step Generally speaking these algorithms first construct a candidate set of large itemsets based on some heuristics and then discover the subset that indeed contains large itemsets This process can be done iteratively in the sense that the large itemsets discovered in one iteration will be used as the basis to generate the candidate set for the next iteration We propose a new approach which partition massive remote sensing data into several independent blocks in which 161 


uses bitset to organize remote sensing data Firstly this algorithm divides massive database into several independent blocks logically Boolean values are stored in the compressed BitSet in each of block It generates frequent itemsets by Bitset logical AND operation replaces database scans for each of block Then it unifies the frequent itemsets and generates global candidate itemsets for the whole data At last it calculates the min-support of these global candidate itemsets and generates global frequent itemsets for the whole data In the first phase of the algorithm for remote sensing data according to the predefined range of remote sensing images Remote Sensing Image RSI data to process discrete quantitative attributes of the image  then divided into several non-overlapping blocks The second phase according to the mapping Bitset of association rules mining algorithm mining frequent itemsets of each of the block then it unifies the frequent itemsets and generates global candidate itemsets for the whole RSI data.The final generates global frequent itemsets for the whole RSI data A modified Apriori TP-PB algorithm is given below Algorithm TP-PB algorithm Input Database D minimum support threshold min-sup;minimum confidence threshold min-conf Output The complete set of frequent itemsets Method  Generation frequent itemsets  1 P=partition-database\(D 2 m Number of partition m represents the number of blocks for Boolean database  represents the transaction number of block database  2 For j  1 j   N j   N represents attribute number of block database 3 if the row i of column j is 1 4 set value of the row i of bit equal to 1 5 else 6 set value of the row i of bit equal to 0 7 end  1-frequent set generation procedure gen_2_ itemsets p i I i  1 to  Cp 1   generate 2-frequent itemset Cp and non frequent itemset C l 2 forj=i+1to Cp  3 Join\(cl i cl j byUsingthejoin method of bitset class to process Bitset CI i AND Bitset cl j operation generate c2 i,j 4 if c2  i j count>min-sup 5 CjPCfUC2 i,j 6 else phase P 3 for i=l;i<=m;i 4 C1 find frequent_1 itemsets\(pi scanning block pi of the database Constructing Bitset  5 gen_2_ itemsets pi 6 C  apriori_gen\(p i 7 8 CG U i=1,2 m Ci   unify frequent itemsets of block Cl and generates global candidate itemsets for the whole data CG  phase IP 9 i=l i<=m;i  calculate the min-support of these global candidate itemsets and generates global frequent itemsets for the whole data  IO final_counts CG,p i ll  ce CG c.count>=Min-Sup 12 Answer LG 13 procedure find_frequent_ itemsets\(p i  scanning block of the database Constructing Bitset  I  i  1 i   rowcount i    rowcount 7 C22 2 UC2 i,j 8  9  1 0 end procedure apriori_gen\(p i I k=2 C  0 k   generate f itemsets of block p 2 foril to Cp 1  3 forj=i+lto C/p  4 if non\(ci 1]=Acj 1k]A Ci 2 cj 2 A..A ci k-l C j kI I A ci k  cjy k 5 6 7 8 9 10 frequent i  for each itemset E Ce 2 if  ci k cj k  c j Ck+l i,j ci  c1 if Ck+l  i j  162

Association Rule mining using TP-PB the rules of fulfilling the minimum support and minimum confidence is strong association rules The association rules the user likes to mine are in the form of B1,B2,B3 Y Now we know that B 1 B2 and B3 are Antecedent and yield is Consequent Assume the minsup  15 and minconf 50 We derive following association rules TABLE 2 ASSOCIATION RULES ID Rules 1 B 1 mid Y-high Sup:33.5 B2-high Y-high Sup:25.3 Duanqiong Chen conf:75.3 200 B I mid conf:73.3 1105 B 1-mid B2-high B3-low Y-high Sup:22.1 conf:70.6 From the table 2 we can see the rule B 1 mid B2-high,B3-low Y-high Sup=22 1 Conf=70.6 which means Bi reflectance falling within 36-55 B2 reflectance at least 161 and B3 reflectance at most 40 implies Yield will be at least 171 namely the high yield This correlation shows that we can adjust the soil moisture fertilizer and crop growing to change to increase crop yield or through remote sensing to crop yield assessment 5 CONCLUSION AND PROSPECT In this paper we presents TP-PB algorithm It applies two phases Association Rule Mining one based Partition and Bitset for massive Remote Sensing Images data Firstly,this algorithm divides massive database into several independent blocks logically Boolean values are stored in the compressed BitSet in each of block It generates frequent itemsets by Bitset logical AND operation replaces database scans for each of block Then it unifies the frequent itemsets and generates global candidate itemsets for the whole data At last it calculates the min-support of these global candidate itemsets and generates global frequent itemsets for the whole data By dividing the massive data into a number of blocks it enhance generic application of algorithm Besides it increases algorithm efficiency that database scans is replaced by Bitset logical AND operation in each of block especially for massive remote sensing image data And the algorithm has been applied to remote sensing images Mining Association Rules in precision agriculture The sequential algorithm is not very suitable for large databases because large-scale databases are generally great in GB and TB Parallel algorithm is used to improve efficiency on Massive Data Mining Partition technology is very suitable for parallel computing So the next step the focus of our work is the combination of parallel computer expands TP-PB algorithm This will further improve the efficiency of the algorithm REFERNCES 1 Agrawal R Srikant R Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules[C In Proceeding of the 20th international Conference on Very Large Databased Santiago Chile 1994:487-499 2 Jiawei Han Micheline Karnber Data Mining Concept and Techniques[M].2001,08 3 Ramakrishnan Strikant Rakesh Agrawal Mining Generalized Association Rules[C Proceeding of the 21st VLDB Conference Zurich Swizerland 1995 4 Tung Anthony K.H Hongjun Lu Jiawei Han Ling Feng Efficient Mining of intertransaction Association Rules J IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering 2003 15\(1 5 Park J S Chen M Yu P S.Using a Hash-based Method with Transaction Trimming for Ming Association Rules J IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering 1997,19\(5 6 Brin S Motwani R Ulman J et al Dynamic Itemset Counting and Implication Rules for Market Basket Data[C In ACM SIGMOD Conf Management of Data 1997 7 Han J Pei J and Y.Yin.Mining Frequent patterns without candidate generation[C In Proc 2000 ACM-SIGMOD Int Conf Management of Data SIGMOD'00 p.p 2000.1-12 8 Huang Hongyu Huang ChongCheng Fan Minghui Map-based BitSet association rule mining of remote sensing images Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2005 IGARSS apos;05 Proceedings 9]Jianning Dong William Perrizo Qin Ding and Jingkai Zhou the Application Association Rule Mining to Remotely Sensed Data Proceedings of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing SAC 00 Como Italy March 2000:1-6 164

association mining The Likelihood Ratio Test fails to extract features also belonging to common vocabulary and it makes the extraction dependent on the feature position in the sentence leading to low recall The dBNP and bBNP based methods yield low recall due to the fact that the product features do not occur with the article the in front of them very often The Association Mining approach returns all frequent nouns which decreases precision Our results suggest that the choice of algorithm to use depends on the targeted dataset If it consists of mainly on-topic content the results of Table 10 indicate that the Association Mining algorithm is better suited for this task due to its high recall If the dataset consists of a mixture of onand off-topic content our results suggest that the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm would perform better due to its ability to distinguish and 002lter out the off-topic features For future work we plan to extend the Likelihood Ratio Test methods especially the dBNP based approach by other determiners such as a or this  which should increase the recall of this method Another possibility which we will investigate regards the BNP patterns The current Likelihood Ratio Test approach is not capable of dealing with discontinuous feature phrases for example in 5 the quality of the pictures is great the feature would be picture quality  This problem could be addressed by introducing wildcards in the BNP patterns We will also investigate whether there are any methods in order to calculate an optimal threshold for the candidate feature extraction in order to increase the recall of the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm We plan to investigate whether a deeper linguistic analysis e.g with a dependency parser can improve the feature

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDDÕ06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821–830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDDÕ99  pages 43–52 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDDÕ01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDMÕ05  pages 713–716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SACÕ06 Data Mining  pages 546–552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117–132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODSÕ03  pages 284–295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILPÕ05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
