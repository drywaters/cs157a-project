However, MapReduce limits itself to a one-\nmap-to-one-reduce framework. Meanwhile, it lacks built-in \nsupport and optimization when the input datasets are shared \namong concurrent applications and/or jobs. The performance \nmight be improved when the shared and frequently accessed \ndata is read from local instead of distributed file system.  \nTo enhance the performance of big data applications, this \npaper presents Concurrent MapReduce, a new programming \nmodel built on top of MapReduce that deals with large amount \nof shared data items. Concurrent MapReduce provides nsupport for processing heterogeneous sources of input datasets \nand offers optimization when the datasets are partially or fully \nshared. Experimental evaluation has shown an execution \nruntime speedup of 4X compared to traditional non-\nconcurrent MapReduce implementation with a manageable \ntime overhead.  \nKeywords Concurrency; MapReduce; Programming Model; \nShared Input Data \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThe highly scalable MapReduce MR  2], an open source \nimplementation of MR, gains popularity due to its reliability \nand scalability in providing a parallel yet simple framework.  \nDue to the ever-increasing complexity of execution logic \nin real-life applications, more and more MR applications \ninvolve multiple correlated jobs. They are encapsulated and \nexecuted in a defined order. For example, a PageRank job [3] \ninvolves two iterative MR sub-jobs; the first job joins a rank \ntable and a linkage table, and the second job calculates the \naggregated rank of each URL. Two non-iterative MR sub-\njobs for counting out-going URLs and assigning initial ranks \nare also included in the PageRank job. \nThough the formulation of each MR sub-job is easy, the \noverall solution may involve many redundant MR sub-jobs. \nThe problem becomes even worse when the MR sub-jobs \ninvolve multiple straightforward but time-consuming tasks. \nA concrete example demonstrating such redundant MR sub-\njobs is given in section 1.A. \nAs a rule-of-thumb, MR has proven to be effective in \nprocessing large amount of dividable unshared input datasets. \nDifferent and concurrently running MR jobs may share input \ndatasets Linkage table in the PageRank job is an example of \nthe shared input dataset. Performance of MR applications ncan be improved if the sharing of input datasets is \nconsidered.  Therefore, we identify two types of data sharing: \ndata sharing among multiple sub-jobs of the same job, and \ndata sharing among multiple distinct jobs.  \nTraditionally, one MR job involves multiple map and \nReduce Tasks. Each Map Task executes the same Map nFunction and processes its own input data splits based on the \ninstructions defined in the Map Function. Each Reduce Task \nexecutes the same Reduce Function and processes its own \nkey-value pair partitions. This one-map-to-one-reduce \nframework, though simple enough, loses its flexibility when \napplications require complex logic. For such complex \nscenarios, users employ multiple jobs, such as the \nimplementation of PageRank and Descendant Query in [3].  \n In this paper, we propose Concurrent MapReduce, \nConMR; a novel programming model that supports multiple \nand heterogonous map and Reduce Functions. Optimizations \nover shared data are offered at the function level and at the \njob level. \nA. A Motivation Example  \nFirst, we discuss a case study of increasing salary for all \nemployees in a multi-national research company for the ncoming year. Fig. 1\(a her current title \nor evaluation score. The left table \(Employee Information or \nEI each employee including ID, \nname, title, current salary, and score. The upper-right table \n\(Title Rate or TR depicts the titles and their corresponding \nsalary increase rates. The lower-right table \(Evaluation Rate \nor ER nfind out the method that costs less.  \nIn Fig. 1\(b is working at. The two tables on the left \(EI \nand BC nstrategies as shown in the two tables on the right \(CR1 and \nCR2 in Fig 1\(a Salary> for each employee. The second \nprocesses TR and outputs <Title, Rate>. The third job joins \nthe outputs and calculates the salary for each employee. \nSimilarly, the other three follow-up MR jobs are launched to \nprocess the EI and ER and join them. Based on this, the \nfollowing points can be observed: \n2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing\n0190-3918/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/ICPP.2013.134\n671\n \(1 Tasks to join.

nconcurrently. \nTraditional MR offers job switching optimization \nmechanisms, such as the use of fair or capacity scheduler, \nbut no such techniques exist for managing shared data \namong different jobs. In this paper, we propose an \noptimization mechanism based on the access frequency of \ndifferent datasets. \nB Contribution and Organization of This Paper \nThe above observations motivate the design of ConMR \nas a new programming model to benefit applications that \nhave shared data on both function and job levels, while nretaining the simplicity of traditional MR. ConMR has the \nfollowing advantages: \n \(1 that supports multiple \ndifferent map and Reduce Functions running at the same \ntime, where each function has either shared or unshared data. \nEach map or Reduce Function corresponds to map or reduce \nstage of traditional MR, which has multiple map or Reduce \nTasks running on different nodes. This is further explained nin section 2. \n\(2 supplies the shared \ndata to different Map Functions that need them. For the \nsame Map Functions that share the data, it further provides \none copy of output to reduce the shuffle overhead. This is \nfurther explained in section 3.B. \n\(3 identifies multiple jobs of \ndifferent users, finds out the frequently- or partially-shared \ndata items, and copies them to the local file system for future \njob use. This is further explained in section 3.A. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 \nintroduces the architecture of our ConMR programming \nmodel Optimization techniques that are applied at the \nfunction- and job-levels to enhance this programming model nare described in section 3. In section 4, we introduce the \nexperimental setting and comparative results on two real \napplications. Finally, we conclude with a review of related \nwork and summarize our technical contributions.  \n672\n II. CONCURRENT MAPREDUCE OVERVIEW \nIn this section, we analyze the example in section 1 to \ndemonstrate the essence of sharing data in our programming \nmodel, and then we introduce the architecture of ConMR. \nA. Concurrent MapReduce Overview \nDifferent map and Reduce Functions may share data at \nthe function level. The shared data can be the input for \ndifferent Map Functions, or intermediate key-value pairs for \ndifferent Reduce Functions. At the job level, the shared data \nare the inputs for different jobs. The shared data can be the \nwhole dataset, or parts of it. Before formally introducing the \nConMR architecture, we propose two scenarios using the \ntwo cases introduced in Section 1. \nScenario 1: In section 1.A, case 1 and case 2 are two \ndistinct jobs that might be written by two different \nprogrammers, who are unaware of each other. In this \nscenario, the two cases are two concurrent jobs illustrated in \nFig. 2\(a b discussed in section 1.A, the four Map Functions for \ncase 1 are denoted as MF11, MF12, MF13 and MF14, which nprocess EI, TR, EI and ER respectively and output key-value \npairs. The first Reduce Function RF11 collects the key-value \npairs from MF11 and MF12 to output the new salaries based \non title. Similarly, the second Reduce Function RF12 \ncollects the key-value pairs from MF13 and MF14 to output \nthe salaries based on evaluation scores. \nVery similar to the first job, the second job has six Map \nFunctions, MF21, MF22,…, MF26 for EI, BC, CR1, EI, BC \nand CR2 respectively. As shown in Fig. 2\(b data from MF21, MF22 and \nMF23 to output the new salaries based on the CR1 rates. \nSimilar map and Reduce Functions are shown for the CR2 \nrate. \n \n\(a nFunctions \n \n\(b of different map and Reduce Functions and their logic \nmappings in scenario 1. \nScenario 2: In this scenario all the map and Reduce \nFunctions are written to run as one job. These are possibly \nwritten by one programmer, who is aware of all the tables \nand datasets and writes the source code of this job. \nThus, there are 10 Map Functions, MF1, MF2,…, MF10, \neach one represents one input entry of Fig. \(2 at the right side of Fig. 2, there are four Reduce \nFunctions named as RF1, RF2, RF3 and RF4. \nThere is one major difference between the two scenarios. \nIn scenario 1, the programmers of the two jobs are unaware \nthat table EI is being shared. They just submit their jobs and \nwait for the results. It is ConMR’s responsibility to discover \nthe shared data and provide mechanisms to optimize the \nconcurrent access. In scenario 2, the programmer has prior \nknowledge about all the tables and datasets that are used and \nshared. Thus, he/she can explicitly indicate the data sharing \nand the ConMR uses this information to provide \noptimization mechanisms for efficient data access.  \nB. Concurrent MapReduce Architecture \nFig. 3 illustrates the architecture of ConMR framework. \nFrom top down, we can see application, ConMR framework \nand file system tiers. A vertical line in the middle separates  \njob related illustrations \(at the left side illustrations \(at the right side a set of map and Reduce \nFunctions. Then it identifies the input data from the \nconfiguration file. For example, job 1 in Fig. 3 is \ndecomposed into a set of Map Functions \(MF11, MF12 RF11, RF12 


submitted jobs. The Shared Job Data Handler \nmanages the shared data at the job level. In the previous nexample, it discovers the shared table EI and copies the data \nto the local file system. This mechanism is further discussed \nin section 3.A.  \nThe Shared Function Data Handler, on the other hand, \nserves and optimizes shared data for map and Reduce \nFunctions. For heterogeneous Map Functions that share the \nsame input data, this handler creates a daemon on each host \nthe data locates, reads the data and supplies them to all the \nMap Tasks associated with these Map Functions. For \nhomogeneous Map Functions that share the same input data, \nthis handler outputs only one copy. We will discuss the \ndetail mechanism in section 3.B. \nEach job tracker, similar to traditional MR, sends map \nand Reduce Tasks to all the nodes. The difference is that it \nhas to manage the tasks of the entire map and Reduce \nFunctions. The job tracker has to communicate with the \nname node to locate the input data and the task trackers. \nEach task tracker is also configured with a bunch of slots for \nmap and Reduce Tasks. An individual job scheduler \nmanages the execution order of the tasks. For example, EI \nshould be firstly joined with BC and then with CR1 in job 2 \nof scenario 1.  \nThe distributed file system is built on top of the local file \nsystem.

Architecture of the Concurrent MapReduce Framework  \nIn the next section, we formally introduce the ConMR \nprogramming model. \nC Concurrent MapReduce Programming Model \nThe ConMR enables defining multiple heterogeneous \nmap and Reduce Functions. We formulate the representation \nas below: \nMap:       \(km, vm k’m, v’m  n{{\(k’\(i,r i,r k’\(j,r j,r  i,r j,r   representation includes M Map Functions and R \nReduce Functions. The Reduce Functions are different from ntraditional MR programming model in that they take input \nkey/value pairs from  multiple key-value pair outputs of \nMap Functions. \(i,r j,r r represents the index \nof the Reduce Function. Symbol pairs \(i,r j,r Function that feed the rth Reduce \nFunction. \nFor example, Map Functions on input key/value pairs \n\(k\(i,1 v\(i,1 k\(j,1 j,1 k’\(i,1 i,1 k’\(j,1 j,1 these outputs are \njoined as the first Reduce Function and the corresponding \noutput dataset is [v”1].  \nMore specifically, we use job 1 in scenario 1 as an \nexample, \(k1, v1 k3, v3 n\(k2, v2 k4, v4 pairs \(k’1, [v’1 k’2, [v’2 k’3, [v’3 k’4, [v’4 in the Fig. 2\(a k’1, [v’1 k’2, [v’2 as [v”1]. These are also similarly \napplied to \(k’3, [v’3 k’4, [v’4 represented [v”3]. All the real key-value pairs of the \nreduce outputs are also shown in Fig. 2 \(a Similar as traditional MR, a configuration file of all the \nfunctions and modules are as follows. A ConMR nprogrammer defines this file in the job configuration file. \nThe ConMR reads this file and initialize the job with the \nconfiguration specifications accordingly. \nClass ConMRJob{ \n   Class Map_m\(key, value  Class Reduce_r\(key, value   Map_m  addReduce\(Reduce_r   mapFunctionList, reduceFunctionList defineJoinRules\(reduceFunctionList Map_m Dir sharedFunctionDataHandler[] sharedFunctionDataHandler It \nimplements a Map Function, which accepts a key-value pair \nand transforms it to a set of new key-value pairs.

SHARED DATA HANDLER \nIn this section, we introduce the shared data handler, \nwhich includes both the Shared Job and Shared Function \nData Handlers. \nA. Shared Job Data Handler \n \nFig. 4 Illustration of two Concurrent MapReduce jobs in scenario 2. Input \ndataset EI, which is shared by two different jobs, is handled by the Shared \nJob Data Handler. \nThe Shared Job Data Handler processes the jobs which \nshare the same input dataset. As being shown in Fig. 4, there \nare two concurrent jobs that share the same table: EI. In this \ncase, we define a handler to orchestrate and manage the \nshared input data among multiple jobs. ConMR finds out \nthat EI is frequently used. Therefore, it computes the input \nsplits only once to feed the Map Tasks, and copies the \nshared input data to local file systems of the system nodes. \nFuture jobs that need EI can read it from local nodes. \nThis handler is implemented in the ConMR framework \nsince the programmer does not know how other jobs define \ntheir input dataset. In algorithm 1, we define a mechanism to ndiscover the frequently used data by recently submitted jobs. \nThe steps of handling shared data are illustrated below. \nAlgorithm 1. Shared Job Data Handler \nInput:  \nConMRJobList[] conMRJobList //Recent submitted jobs \nOutput:  \nSharedJobDataHandler sharedJobDataHandler \nProcedure ninputDataSetList=AnalyzeInputDataSet\(conMRJobList[i isFrequentUsedData\(inputData inputData File System; \nEndFor \nThe procedure above demonstrates the steps to handle \nthe shared input data among multiple MR jobs. In the first \nline, the input data of a new coming job is decomposed into \nan inputDataSetList. Then each input file in this list is \niterated via a isFrequentUsedData function \ndefines if the file is used frequently recently.  \nDifferent solutions can be applied to define the nfrequently used data. For example, the data with an \naccessing statistic average value above a threshold over all \nthe submitted jobs can be deemed as frequently used. A \nshorter time window which considers the newest submitted \njobs can also be applied. In our late experiment, we set the \ndata as frequently used if the newest five submitted jobs \nhave at least visited the input data three times. \nOther than the replication dereplication' can also be \napplied. Imagine the case in which some data has not been \naccessed by the five last jobs, but was previously marked as \n'frequently used', the data can be deleted from local file \nsystem to save storage space of each individual nodes. This \n‘dereplication’ strategy is not tested in this paper, which will \nbe touched in our future work. \nB. Shared Function Data Handler \nIn Fig. 5, we illustrate the Shared Function Data Handler. \nSince EI is shared by MF11 and MF13, it would be better to \npush the data to the two Map Functions instead of pulling \nthe data by the two Map Functions themselves. In this case, \nthe handler creates one copy of its implementation at each \nslave node where data EI is located, and supplies the data to nthe local Map Tasks of MF11 and MF12. \nFor a Map Task, the jobtracker takes into account the \ntasktracker’s location and assigns a Map Task on the nodes \nwhere its input dataset is located. The Map Tasks of MF11 \nand MF13 that process the same split of data of EI can be \nco-located at the same node. Thus, the implementation of the \nShared Function Data Handler can be located at the same \nhost and serves the shared data for both MF11 and MF12. \n \nFig. 5. Illustration of the Shared Function Data Handler for heterogeneous \nMap Functions in one job. Instead of the two Map Functions reading the \nshared data EI separately, the handler supplies EI to both MF11 and MF13. \n \nFig. 6. Illustration of the Shared Function Data Handler for homogeneous \nMap Functions in one job. The handler supplies the shared data EI and BC \nto the Map Functions that need them. It also generate one copy of the \noutput data. \nIn Fig. 6, we illustrate an optimization of the Shared \nFunction Data Handler Notice this handler is currently used \nfor the same Map Function on the same input datasets. For \nexample, two pairs of Map Functions \(MF21&MF24 and \nMF22&MF25 input datasets EI and BC are shared, \nwe still can use the method in Fig. 5 to allocate the handler 


nFurthermore, instead of generating two copies of outputs \nfor EI as shown in Fig. 2\(b Data \nHandler for Map Functions generates only one output copy. \nThis one output does not have to include the identifier key \n“1” or “2” to indicate where the data is from. This is because \nthe Reduce Function does not have to care about the source \nof the input data if the Map Functions are exactly the same. \nThis handler makes sure that the key-value pairs for EI \nare shuffled to Reduce Functions only once.

First, the latter discovers the \nshared data by calculating the recently used data among \ndifferent jobs while the former does not have to. Second, the \nlatter provides optimization by copying the shared data to \nthe local file system, while the former supplies data to \ndifferent Map Tasks.

We \nuse the tuple \(number of graph nodes – nodes connectivity \ndegree example, we use \n10000-0.01 to demonstrate the input graph with 10,000 \nnodes, and each node has 10,000 × 0.01 100 adjacent \nneighbors.  Input data size is defined as small, moderate and \nlarge are graphs with sizes of 10000-0.01, 100000-0.001, \n1000000-0.0001 respectively. \nIn this SSSP benchmark, we test the job-level nconcurrency, which runs multiple jobs over shared graph, \nwe copy the shared data among multiple jobs to local file \nsystem to ensure data locality. \nString Matching is the other benchmark we use. A very \nbig size string \(typically a few GB nwith different users’ strings, which are far shorter than the \nreference string, are used to match the reference string in \norder to find the number of occurrences of this substring in \nthe reference string. This string matching benchmark is \nimportant in genome sequence alignment, where the string \nis a typical genome sequence. \nFor the string matching benchmark, we use both the \nshared data at job-level and function-level to test the \nefficiency of this framework.  \nB. Experimental Results  \nIn Fig. 7 and 8, we show the effectiveness of the Shared \nData Handlers for the two benchmark applications under \nvaried input data size.

benchmark. The execution time \nshown excludes the shared data copy time for ConMR. \nIn both applications, the results demonstrate clear \nadvantage of the ConMR data sharing approach as \ncompared to the traditional Non-ConMR. Moreover, this \nadvantage is much greater as the  number of jobs increases. \nIn the one-job case no matter how large the cluster size \nis, the execution times of the two methods are similar. This \nis because no concurrency can be utilized for the ConMR to \ntake advantage of.  \nIn the multiple job cases as shown below, we can see a \nperformance speedup of up to 4X for the case of a cluster of \nsize eight \(VM=8 number equals to 4 \(see Fig. \n7\(a delays the whole execution time of the \nfour jobs. With 210 seconds in ConMR for runing four \nconcurrent jobs the execution time is 816 seconds for \nrunning the four jobs in a standard MR manner. Similar \nresults also apply to the same configuration in Fig. 7\(b size for the four jobs on eight VMs, while ConMR takes \n1468 seconds instead. \nAnother parameter that affects the performance is the \ncluster size. Using larger cluster size normally shows better \nperformance than using a small one. This benefit is better \nillustrated for larger input data size. In Fig. 7\(a b execution time of Non-Concurrent MR for the four-jobs \ncase is very close across different cluster sizes. In the large \ninput data size case, as shown in Fig. 7\(c nIn ConMR, the large cluster size benefits over Non-\nConcurrent MR in SSSP cases. Except in using large input ndata size as in Fig. 7\(c 2-job and \n4-job cases. This doesn’t apply to ConMR. This is easy to \nexplain. ConMR explores more parallelism when running \nmultiple jobs. Large cluster size would benefit more from \nthis mechanism coupled with large input data size. \nIn short, ConMR performs better than its counterpart. It \nfavors large number of jobs running on large cluster size. \nParallelism in job-level and function-level data sharing are \nbetter exploited and utilized in this case. \n \n\(a 10000-0.01 a 1GB b Moderate input data size \(100000-0.001 b 2GB c 1000000-0.0001 c 4GB running on String Matching Benchmark\n677\n In Fig. 9, we measure the overhead time used to copy \nthe shared input dataset from HDFS to individual VMs. As \nwe can see, copying 4GB shared data to 8VMs in parallel \ntakes around 140 seconds. This is a one-time overhead, \nwhich means the shared data would be copied only once. It nbenefits all the following concurrent jobs. As shown in Fig. \n8, the more jobs we run, the more benefit we get from this \ndata copying. For example in a 4 job case, ConMR has \nreduced the execution time more than 600 seconds at the \ncost of only 125 seconds for the shared data copying. \n \n \nFig. 9. Overhead time of copying the shared input data from HDFS to each \nindividual VM instance. \nV. RELATED WORK \nIn the past, many endeavors have focused on proposing \nextended or new programming models for big-data \nproblems other than the widely accepted MR. We are \ntargeting this problem by exploring the data sharing at \nfunction/job level, and providing a framework to  exploit \nthe advantages of this sharing of data. \nEfficient and effective programming models for different \ncomputing infrastructures have been of interest to both \nacademia and industry. The advent of MapReduce [1] has \nspawned new research efforts on the development of \nprogramming models for big-data processing. Dryad [6][7] \nis proposed as an extension of MR. It employs Directed \nAcyclic Graph \(DAG  motivated by the structure of SQL, for efficient execution \non very large clusters. \nMR has also been enhanced by a number of research \nefforts. HaLoop [3], a revised programming model that \nintegrates loop-based processing for MR applications, has \ndemonstrated significant performance improvement when \nthe input data is partially shared. Map-Reduce-Merge [9] \nintroduces a “merge” stage after traditional MR to merge the \noutputs of multiple MR jobs.  \nThe motivation for the two papers are similar to ours’ in \nfunction-level concurrency Unlike them, we explore data \nsharing in job-level concurrency as well to efficiently \nmanage concurrent jobs submitted by different users. \nAlong the line of MR extensions, other research efforts \naddressed data streaming environments. Nova [10], due to \nits support for stateful incremental processing leveraging Pig nLatin [11], deals with continuous arrival of streaming data. \nIncoop [12] is proposed as an incremental computation to \nimprove the performance of MR framework. Deduce [13] \nand S4 [14] are other new programming models for \nstreaming data applications. \nPregel [15] is a message-based programming model to \ndeal with distributed large graph programs. It uses vertex, \nmessages and multiple iterations in order to provide a ncompletely new programming mechanism. GraphLab \n[16][17] is proposed to deal with scalable algorithms in data nmining and machine learning that run on multicore clusters. \nIn this paper, we focus on an improvement on traditional \nrigid map and Reduce Functions organized in any MR job \nby a more flexible framework, while exploiting job and \nfunction level to enhance the overall performance. \nFor a Reduce Function whose input 


datasets are \nproduced by two or more Map Functions, joining among \ndifferent datasets is widely applied in ConMR. There are a \nnumber of research papers to address the problem of joins \nusing MR related solutions Broadcast join is proposed in \n[18] for one dataset is relatively small. This dataset can be \ncopied to each computing machine for conducting join \noperations at local file systems. Different join algorithms are ncompared in [19]. One-phase-join mentioned in [20] uses a \nfiltering-join-aggregation model to deal with Map-Join-\nReduce. Research papers [21][22] optimize multiple joins \nusing Lagrange relaxation method. In [23 the authors \npropose matrix-based method to balance the input and \noutput dataset size for different Reduce Tasks. In [24], \nHilbert Space Filling Curve is proposed to deal with multi-\nway theta-join problem. \nRestore 25] has been used to keep intermediate results \nfor future workflow use. Unlike this method, our data reuse nis share-aware and corresponding optimization is offered. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper, we propose ConMR, a concurrent MR \nprogramming model. ConMR addresses the need to define \nmultiple independent MR sub-jobs to provide a solution to a \ncomplex problem. Besides this, ConMR reduces the amount \nof work by taking into account data sharing at the job  and \nfunction levels. To summarizes the main contributions.  \n\(1 We propose a concurrent MR framework ConMR \nwith multiple heterogeneous map and Reduce Functions. \nThe shared data of different map and Reduce Functions are \ndefined by programmers to guarantee the data sharing is nimplemented in an efficient manner. \n\(2 levels. For job-level data sharing, the \nframework manages the data by replicating data to ensure \ndata locality. For function-level data sharing, it provides \noptimization by supplying the shared data to multiple Map \nTasks from different Map Functions. It also merges the \noutput of the same Map Functions on the shared data. \n\(3 nMatching. Results have demonstrated up to 4X performance \nspeedup compared to traditional non-concurrent MR n \n \n678\n  \nFuture work will focus on the following three directions. \n\(1 Handler to process \ndifferent Map Functions, we can optimize it further by \nmerging the outputs of the intermediate key-value pairs. For \nexample, we can merge the outputs of MF11 and MF13 in \nFig. 2\(a intermediate key-value pairs can be like \n<EI00, PS, 12000, 96> et al.  \n\(2 method using a large \ncluster size on both a public cloud and a private cloud. \nCurrently we are using up to eight instances on Amazon \nEC2. The advantage of the programming model will be \nfurther amplified given a larger cluster size. \n\(3 programming model \nwith built-in support for job- and function-level optimization. \nAcknowledgments: This publication was made possible by \nNPRP grant # 09-1116-1-172 from the Qatar National \nResearch Fund \(a member of Qatar Foundation acknowledge Amazon for providing \nresearch grant for using Amazon web services. \nVII.

CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
