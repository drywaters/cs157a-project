FP-Growth Algorithm for Application in Research of Market Basket Analysis Yongmei Liu and Yong Guan Capital Normal University Beijing China snowflash@163.com and gxyl69gsina.com Abstract During the process of mining frequent item sets kind of method that cannot have the frequent candidate when minimum support is little the production of candidate sets[21 To FP-Growth algorithm frequent sets are sets is a kind of time-consuming and frequent operation in constructed mainly through FP-Tree FP-Tree is a the mining algorithm The FP growth algorithm does not compression expression of the related information with need to produce the candidate sets the database which the frequent item set in a database During its realization 
provides the frequent item set is compressed to a frequent we realized the entire algorithm by a series of the data pattern tree or FP tree and frequent item set is mining by construction which is from low to high using of FP tree For the sake of researching market basket analysis the Frequent-Pattern is introduced Visual C is II BASIC CONCEPT applied to design the program to mine the frequent item   sets In view of the frequent K-item set the various results The associaton rules are an important research content are contrasted the goods which is sell possibly at the same in the data mining But the production of 
frequent sets is time in the supermarket is arranged in the same place the first step before the production of association rules In majority old realizations people generally used the I INTRODUCTION algorithm that is similar to Apriori 3'41 Apriori has a very big shortcoming we have to obtain the frequent sets by In the past dozens of years the development of the production of the candidate sets unceasingly economic iS SWIft and violent Andtnthevlevel of information enhances unceasingly so the organizations However the cost of candidate sets is very prodigious and agencies have collected the massive business data FP-Growth algorithm's merit is that it can save time and 
generally However we have these massive data does not storage space and use the means of partitioning to avoid mean that we had the rich commercial information The the large-scale database To FP-Growth algorithm we business organization urgent needs to discover the usually construct the frequent sets through FP-Tree Here valuable information and knowledge from the we only introduce the basic concepts related with FP magnanimous data The typical example of mining a growth al orithm frequent item set is market basket analysis 1 through g discovering the connection between the different Let I  I  i 2 i m  be a set of items Let D

classification rule is easy and human-readable. To solve the problems of existing associative classification for text categorization, Closed-AC is proposed in this paper. The advantages of Closed-AC are as follows. On the one hand, rough set is used to dimension reduction. On the other hand, only generic rules composed of closed itemsets are used for classification. Experiment al results show the proposed associative classifier is effective Acknowledgements This work is supported by Beijing Municipal Education Commission \(KM200710009006 Key Youth Research Project of North China University of Technology References  S.

Discussion  Applying DruTiMine on several tissues for cancer has proven the validity of the system where text mining and association rule mining are used based on microarray experiments to identify drug targets for the specified disease and tissue type. DruTiMine can help pharmaceuticals to identify drug targets of proteins/genes/chemical compounds in silicon instead of going through major steps of laboratory tests in vitro This does not mean that laboratory tests will not be needed, but the need for systems like DruTiMine is becoming a must for providing guidance to experts before conducting laboratory experiments Microarray experiments have proven through DruTiMine, to be very useful for deriving drug targets of proteins/genes/chemical compounds. The system is capable of relating proteins identified in Medline database abstracts to differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments and provided insight on possible associations among a variety of related biological information such as gene molecular functions gene biological process and gene cellular components which is definitely of value in speeding up the drug target discovery phase of the drug discovery process      6. C onclusions and future work  DruTiMine has been introduced as a new system for identifying drug targets based on microarray experiments  Given a user-selected disease and associated criteria as mentioned above the user can identify drug targets related to this disease starting with microarray experiments.  We have explained the architecture process and usage scenario of how to discover drug targets through the integration between text mining and association rule mining We have tested our system to cancer with eight different tissues breast kidney ovarian prostate pancreatic liver skin, and lung.  In our future work, we will develop a protein-protein interaction network describing the type of interaction we can extract from related publications in order to understand the type of interaction affecting diseases Finally regarding our microarray experiments\222 retrieval we intend to consider other microarray databases such as ArrayExpress and Stanford microarray database  7.

Therefore, in this paper we mainly focused on the problem to find all the longest intervals for each cycle To confront the above problem efficiently, we introduced two main search techniques IVP Interval Validation Process\ and PSM \(Process Switching Mechanism\.  In this paper we have presented an effective mining approach for finding all the periodic time intervals for a given sequential pattern. As a future work the process presented in this paper can be extended to find periodic time intervals for all the given sequential patterns in one database scan However to accomplish this task a more complex data-structure/memory management technique needs to be implemented REFERENCES 1  X  Chen and I.
