We \nlearn boundaries from simulated data from alternative plan \ninstances of an expeditionary operation, beyond which drastic \nchanges can occur. This is performed in a simulation-based ndecision support system through an event-based simulation that \nmodel plans according to the effects-based planning \(EBP  FOI research project "Real-Time \nSimulation Supporting Effects-Based Planning", which is funded by \nthe R&D programme of the Swedish Armed Forces. \nAnna Linderhed \nDepartment of Sensor Informatics \nDivision of Sensor and E W  Systems \nSwedish Defence Research Agency \nP.O.

These plan instances are nevaluated as to their performance and clustered by neural Potts \nspin clustering [4, 5] into clusters where all plan instances have \nboth common characteristics and outcomes [6, 7]. \nWe extend a methodology for learning the boundaries \nbetween single pairs of clusters [S] to manage any number of \nclusters. These boundaries are represented as high dimensional \nhyperplanes. We use a support vector machine \(SVM  nthat learn support vectors for all clusters and we derive all \nhyperplanes from the support vectors. \nIn order to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperplanes we \nuse Dempster-Shafer theory [1l-13] for model screening of all \nactions of the plan. The idea is to find subsets of action \nalternatives that partition the set of all alternative ways to \nperform the action. This is done individually for each pair of \nclusters, with the purpose of finding those actions of the plan \nwith the highest average discriminating capacity between all nclusters. \nWe provide decision support during execution of a plan by \ncalculating the distance from the plan to the closest hyperplane \nstep-by-step as action-by-action is being executed. By \nvisualizing the change in distance during execution a \ncommander may observe if the operation is approaching a \nboundary beyond which outcomes may be uncertain. \nIn section II we introduce EBP. In section III we describe \nthe scenario of an expeditionary operation. In section IV we \ndescribe event-based simulation of military operational plans \nand the A * -search through simulation increments of alternative \nplan instances. In section V we present a method for clustering \nall simulated and evaluated plans into clusters with common \ncharacteristics and outcomes. In section VI we perform an \ninformation fusion based model screening of all actions of the \nplan in order to find the actions with the highest differentiating \ncapacity between the plans of different clusters. In section VII \nwe use an SVM to learn support vectors of each pair of clusters \nusing the reduced plan instances. From these vectors we derive \nlow dimensionality hyperplanes that work as boundaries \nbetween military plans of different characteristics and \noutcomes of different clusters. The implementation of SVM is ndescribed in section VIII. In section IX we elaborate on the \n978-605-86311-1-3 ©2013 ISIF 1204 \nusage of 


hyperplanes and demonstrate how the distance from a \nplan during execution to the boundary it should not move nbeyond can be visualized for decision support. When a plan is \nat or close to the boundary an unexpected outcome may push \nthe plan over that boundary. Finally, in section X conclusions \nare drawn. \nII EFFECTS-BASED PLANNING \nHow we model a phenomenon depends on the purpose of \nthe model and the questions we want to answer. Since our \nsimulation system aims to support decision-making within an \neffects-based approach to operations \(EBAO  plan, action, effect, end state, etc. \nEBAO is a military approach to the management and \nimplementation of efforts at the operational level. According to \nthe United States Joint Forces Command \(USJFCOM operations that are planned, executed, assessed, and \nadapted based on a holistic understanding of the operational \nenvironment in order to influence or change system behavior or \ncapabilities using the integrated application of selected \ninstruments of power to achieve directed policy aims" [16]. \nWithin the framework of EBAO, EBP is a method for \ndeveloping objectives and effects to be achieved through a \nseries of synchronized actions within a military operational \nplan, conceptually developed starting top-down from a desired \nend state. \nIII. BOGALAND SCENARIO \nWe make use of the same scenario that has regularly been \nused by the Swedish Armed Forces in the Combined Joint Staff \nE xercises. The scenario comprises several fictitious countries ntwo of which, Xland and Bogaland, have been described in­\ndepth. Background histories offer explanations to why and how \nsentiments, stances, identities, loyalties, economic \ndependencies and inequalities have evolved over time, \noccasionally resulting in shifts of power. Phenomena that are \ncommonly found in conflict areas and post conflict areas have \nbeen embedded in scenario contexts that make the origins of \nthe phenomena plausible, Fig. I .  \nFig. 1. The BogaJand scenario. \nIn Bogaland, a newly industrialized country, a civil war nbroke out ten years ago when discontent within the minority \nethnic-religious group had reached very high levels. The root \ncause was increasing social stratification caused by what \nmembers of the minority group perceived as unjust distribution \nof revenues from a natural resource located in an area \npopulated by the minority group. The civil war put an end to \nthe exploitation of the resource, in this case oil, and revenues ndropped to very low levels. The country was split into two \nparts, roughly along ethnic lines, with each part having its own \ngovernment. A post-war economy evolved over the next \ndecade, and several irregulars and insurgents are now \nchallenging the incumbent presidents. \nThe incumbent presidents have signed a peace-agreement, \nand an international force, BFOR, is present to support the \nimplementation of the agreement. Irregular groups in Bogaland \nseek to preserve or increase their influence by undermining the nefforts ofBFOR, the governments or competing irregulars. \nIV. EVENT-BASED SIMl!LATION OF PLANS USING A* \nA Plans \nA plan as it is defined in the context of EBAO is a sequence \nof actions that together leads to a desired end state which is set \nby a military force. \nA typical plan instance PI in our scenario of study is n[1 2 41 61 43 108 20 8 21 12 0 62 64 50 \n60 52 18 25 63 53 55 56 70 78 67 82 90 \n79 80 97 0 95 96 104 106 29 30 0 0 0 58 \n46 47 3215.1 2422.0 793.1] \nwhere all but the three last numbers in this sequence are the nnumbers of the selected alternative for each action in this plan \ninstance. For example, action number 3 i.e., position 3 in the \nsequence actions are numbered with running numbers in no \nparticular order. The three last parameters are different nevaluation measures called f, g and h. They are distance \nmeasures calculated from changes in the scenario state and \nused in an A *-search algorithm. If all possible plan instances \nare represented in a tree, a full plan instance is a path from the \nroot of the tree down to one particular leaf. Obviously, the \ndepth of the tree is the length of the sequence minus three \(i.e., \nnot counting the f, g and h estimates PI above \ncorresponds to a sequence of 43 specific simulations for the 43 \nactions where the actions take the numbered alternative listed \nin the sequence as its input parameter [2]. A few actions have \nvalue "0". These are actions not performed in this particular \nplan instance. \nB. Simulating action alternatives \nThe scenario consists of participating actors, their initial \nstates and probability distribution for different actions nenvironmental data, as well as the plan that is to be evaluated. \nThe system state Sn is defined as the combination of all \nactors' state parameters. Consider action An- It transforms \nsystem state Sn_1 according to Sn = j\(Sn_], An agendas and response operations, and other \nexternal events. Hence, our function j\(Sn-b An event-driven simulation model in order to manage the \ncomplex interactions in a transparent manner [17]. \nWe know that the goal of the simulation is to execute \ndifferent plans and identify those plans that result in system \nstates that are closest to our end state, i.e., has the shortest \ndistance to it. \nC. Searching among action alternatives \nTo fmd good combinations of alternatives for all actions of \nthe plan we apply A search. [t means that, on the basis of a \ngiven system state, we simulate the effect of each alternative 


naction in our plan, but only one step at the time. Doing so, for \nevery alternative, we get a new system state whose distance to \nthe desired end state is calculated. Given the alternative that is \nbest, i.e closest to our end state, we simulate possible \nsubsequent alternative actions provided, but again only one nstep ahead in our action/event list. One of these alternatives \nleads to a condition that is closer than the others. However, it is \npossible that all the alternatives actually lead away from the \ntarget as seen by Fig 2. \n812 \nappears 10 be "closest" fo the target \nFig. 2. An example illustrating the four first steps in a simulation of a plan \nstarting with initial system state So with the distance of 100 to the desired end nstate. \nTherefore, we must also compare the new distance with the \nbest of the distances that have been simulated and recorded in \nthe previous simulation steps, but then had opted out in favor \nof a better sequence of alternative actions. The best sequence \nnow becomes the basis for the next simulation step nDuring simulation an assessment is made of how well each \naction is performed. This is done by the functions g and h. \nFunction g measures the consequence of all performed actions \nas a distance from the initial state So,o to the current simulated \nstate Sx, Yx action-by-action [ I ,  2]. We have, \nx-I \ng\(y Si.Yi Si I.Yi+l 1 state. \nThe estimated distance from the current state to the end \nstate is given by \n\(2 weighted estimated distance from the initial \nstate to the end state via the current state Sx.y, is \n\(3 is the distance function that is minimized by A *. The \nweight "80" was derived by experimentation to balance the \nperformance of minimizing g and h and is domain dependent. \nIn an experiment performed, we used a full size operational \nplan of 43 actions and simulated 10 000 different plan \ninstances. The total computation time was 66.5 hours using a \nsingle core processor. This problem scales well for parallel \ncomputing as we have a Monte Carlo loop within the event­\nbased simulation that is easy to compute in parallel. \nV. CLUSTERING SIMULATED PLAN INSTANCES \nWe cluster the patterns of plan instances that are similar in \nstructure and consequences. Similar in structure means that \nthey have more or less carried out similar alternative actions nSimilar in consequences means that they travel on average the \nsame distance action-by-action towards the end state. \nWe observe the difference in consequences between two \nplans. We compare the difference in the incremental changes of \ng and h called AG and AH, respectively, for each action Ak and \nboth plans Pi and Pj as they progresses down the sequence of \nadditional actions Ak- We have, for each Ak, \nand \nwhere \n\(6 n\(7 variable referring to the kth action of the ith \nplan. [t takes an integer as its value that is the number of the \nalternative for this action, e.g., PIA3 = 41 imply that action \nnumber 3 of plan number 1 performs alternative number 41. \nIn addition, we need to measure the structural distance \nbetween two plans. This is done by the Hamming [18] distance \nHa which measures the structural distance between Pi and Pi" \n1206 \nWe have, \n\(8 by definition. \nUsing this measure, we compare each action in two \ndifferent plans to calculate the structural distance between the \nplans. For each action we observe the alternative chosen in \nboth plans. \nWe put these three measures together into an interaction \nfunctions that measures the overall distance between plan P i nand Pi [2]. \nWe have, \n\(9 difference, and all sums of the three lines are \nnormalized by the number of actions of the plan. Thus, \nJ,j E 0, 1], and is " I "  if one of the three measures is at \nmaximum, and is "0" is all three measures are at minimum. \nWe partition the set of all simulated plans into clusters \nusing the Potts spin model [4] in such a way as to minimize the \noverall sum of all interactions J,j within each cluster. \nThe Potts spin problem consists of minimizing an energy \nfunction \nN q \nE = ?

This model nserves as a clustering method if J;j is used as a penalty factor \nwhen plan P i and Pi are in the same cluster. \nFor computational reasons we use a mean field model, \nwhere spins are deterministic with Via W;a  are formulated [5] as \nwhere \nv = lG \ne-H  n\(11 12 interaction. This is a system \nparameter initialized to \n\(13 max are the \nextreme eigenvalues of M, where \n\(14 11 12 are \niterated until a stationary equilibrium state has been reached for \neach temperature. Then, the temperature is lowered step-by­\nstep by a constant factor until Vi, a. Via = {O, I }  in the \nstationary equilibrium state, Fig. 3 [6, 7]. \nVI. EVIDENTIAL MODEL SCREENING OF ACTIONS \nIn this section we investigate which actions of the plan \nhave most differentiating capacity for each pair of clusters \nusing Dempster-Shafer 


theory. These are the actions that \nshould be part of an indicator projected from c dimension, onto the set of these actions. This will \nreduce, by the same factor, the dimensionality of the support \nvectors and hyperplanes that are learned from all plan instances \nof reduced dimensionality \(section VII differentiating actions are found by investigating \nthe maximum differentiating capacity for one action Ak of two \ndisjoint subsets of the frame of discernment 8k \n{P;.AkIXI' Ak}; one for each cluster, i.e., the set of possible \nvalues of Ak over all clusters Xj ' where i,j and k are indices for \ndifferent plan instances clusters and actions, respectively. Note \nthat 8k is an element from {8k}k that is not dependent on \ncluster but varies for each action Ak-\nWe develop a method, which for each cluster Xj calculate \nhistograms for all actions Ak over all plan instances that we \nreceive from the simulation-based decision support system. \nFrom all plan instances P i in each cluster Xj we build the \nhistogram over all alternatives for Ak. \n1207 nINITIALIZE \nK \(number of clusters number of plans 0.5; \nyD = Tc \(a critical temperature m;n' "max of M, \nwhereMij = Jij -y8 ij; \nI VO = -+ £·rand[O 1] Vi, a,' lG K ' \nREPEAT \no REPEAT-2 \nVi Do: N fs + J,j no H;? = L JDV 1'- + £. rand[O,I] Va; \nF; \no s =s+ l ; \nUNTIL-2 \n.!.

When this is the case we have \nan action with high discriminating capacity. \nHowever, our interest is in finding different subsets of nalternatives with maximum differentiating capacity. In order to \nhandle this situation we need to represent the histograms as \nbasic belief assignments within Dempster-Shafer theory. \nFrom each histogram we construct a basic belief \nassignment where the frequency of "0" is assigned to 8k- This \nis a mass function where all focal elements except one are \nsingleton subsets of the frame [ {l}, mxp l i.e., actions of \nthe plan The exception being the support of 8k [8k, mX}8k of8k \(i.e., regarding action Ak 16 plan instances. Note, that all \nsubsets B with cardinality 1 < lEI < 18kl receive zero support . \nIn order to evaluate the discriminating capacity of a \nparticular action Ak for a pair of clusters X; and Xl we ninvestigate the separation of all disjoint subsets. We find the \nmaximum separation for the two disjoint subsets where we \nmeasure the difference in belief in a subset X of two different \nbelief functions from X and Xl' respectively, for Ak, and the \ndifference in belief for another disjoint subset Y between Xl \nand X Here, X and Yare disjoint subsets X n Y = 0 of the \nframe of discernment where Xu Y <;;; 8k, i.e., not necessarily \nXuY=8k• \nWe calculate the discriminating capacity DCCAk of belief between two clusters \nX; and Xl for each of two disjoint subsets X and Y of the frame \n8k- We have nDCCA k X 17 2.

Using a \nthreshold we can project all plan instances onto a smaller \nnumber of screened factors with high discriminating capacity. \nIn Fig. 4 we show the calculation of A DCCAk 18 the plan in the example. From this result we \ncan select a subset of actions that has the highest ndiscriminating capacity ranked by ADCCAk nboundaries between clusters. \n0.7 \n0.6 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n0.3 \n0.2 \n0.1 \no \no 10 15 20 25 \nFig. 4.

system, these three \nvalues are always included in the projected plan instance. \nVII. LEARNING SUPPORT VECTORS AND HYPERPLANES \nWe summarize the information contained in a cluster by \nusing a hyperplane created by an SVM We are mainly \ninterested in the distances from a chosen plan to its boundary \nwith classes other than its own. Several stages are needed to \nachieve the result. First, we need to find the best way to \nrepresent the training data for use in the SVM, this includes \nnormalization. Secondly, we must analyze the problem of nfmding optimal SVM-parameters and a kernel. Finally, we \nanalyze the distances. An SVM analysis finds the hyperplane \nthat is oriented so that the margin between the support vectors \nof different classes is maximized. \nThe concept of treating the objects to be classified as points \nin a high-dimensional space and finding a line that separates \nthem is not unique to the SVM. The SVM, however, is \ndifferent from other hyperplane-based classifiers in how the \nhyperplane is chosen. If we define the distance from the \nseparating hyperplane to the nearest data point as the margin of \nthe hyperplane, then the SVM selects the maximum margin nseparating hyperplane. Selecting this hyperplane maximizes \nthe SVM's capability to calculate the correct classification of \nup to that time unseen plan instances. When representing the \nclassification boundary by the SVM optimal hyperplane, each \ndimension has a bound for the corresponding action in the plan. \nUsing the SVM decision function, each action can be evaluated \nby its presence in the tested plans presented to the decision \nfunction. This way we can correct our bad plans to be good \nplans by simply changing the bad actions. \nThe first step is to adapt the plans to the SVM machinery. \nSVM requires that each data instance is represented as a vector \nof real numbers. Let a plan contain R actions which can take \nany value representing a valid alternative for this action. We \ngenerate N number of R-dimensional vectors for training. The \nplans are clustered into different classes to be used as training \ntargets Yi' Training plans are represented by vectors \nxi = {Xi!' ""xiI}' The plan vectors xi are all normalized. \nScaling them before applying the SVM is very important. This \nis done to avoid that attributes in greater numeric ranges \ndominate those in smaller numeric ranges. \nThe basic idea of SVM is to find a function [\(x actually obtained targets Yi for \nall training data {\(xl' Yl X" y space of the input plans. \nIn the case of linear functions [, a separating hyperplane, \nwritten in terms of a weight vector wand a threshold b takes \nthe form [\(x x,w 0 dot product.

The choice of kernel used in \nthis work is a Gaussian, which has a single parameter \n\(22 model parameters. Some flexibility in separating \nthe categories is needed. SVM implementations have a cost nparameter C, which controls the trade off between allowing \ntraining errors and forcing rigid margins. This parameter gives \nthe model a soft margin that permits some misclassifications \n[10]. Increasing C increases the cost of misclassification of \nplans and forces a more accurate model to be crated. A search \nis used to fmd the optimal value of C and y. \nUsing a hyperplane to separate the feature vectors into two \nclasses works when there are only two target categories, but \nhow do we handle the case where we have more than two nclasses? The two most used methods are: \(i the other \ncategories are merged and \(ii k - 1 is the number of \ncategories. In this work we use the second approach and we \nevaluate classes against each other. \nV III. IMPLEMENTATION OF SVM \nWe study an experiment of 1000 evaluated plan instances \nthat are clustered by Potts spin clustering into eleven different \nclusters based on their characteristics and outcomes. E ach \naction of the plan holds a unique integer number representing \nthe alternative performed for that action. A training matrix of \nthe 1000 different plans of length 46 is normalized with respect \nto each action. The eleven clusters are represented as classes \nwhich in turn are represented by any integer between 1 and 11. \nWe use the L1BSVM library [20] in this work. Important in \nUBSVM is the kernel function and the choice of if its \nparameters. Parameter optimization is done by a full search out \nof a pre-defmed parameter 


set Cross validation is used for \nselection of best parameters for this training set, meaning that \neach combination of parameter choices is checked using cross \nvalidation, and the parameters with best cross-validation \naccuracy are chosen. Using the selected parameters the final \nmodel is trained on the whole training set We use the optimal \nhyperplane defined by the SVM for determining the distance \nfrom any plan to the boundary of the classes for the other plans. \nSince LIBSVM only delivers output for calculating the ndistance to the support vectors, the plans nearest the \nhyperplane of each class, we use an extra class for the plan \nunder execution. This is \(by definition from any specific plan of interest \nto the hyperplane can be calculated. Most interesting is how the \ndistance for a specific plan under execution changes depending \non how many of the actions has been performed. To be able to \ncalculate this, the SVM needs to be re-trained for each new \nnumber of performed actions. \nThe primal variable w is not a direct output of L1BSVM. \nInstead we use the provided support vectors SVs and the ncoefficients for the support vectors sv _coef; \nw = SVs * sv_coef. \(23 from the trained model. It \nincludes result from every combination of all classes. We are, \nhowever, only interested in the part of b regarding class 12 of \nthe plan under execution. We need to select these by a selection \nvector for b. \nThe model is trained for twelve classes, eleven classes from \npre-calculated Potts spin clustering and one class containing \nthe plan under execution. Training is done 45 times for each ninvestigation, each training with successive longer plans, from \nplan length of 2 actions to training on the full matrix with 43 \nactions, see TABLE L \nTABLE I: Psendo code for the investigation. \nI.

The length of the plans is on \nthe x-axis and the distances on the y-axis. The distances from \nthe tested plan to the boundary of another class varies with the \nlength of the plan.

CONCLUSIONS \nWe conclude that it is possible to provide decision support \nregarding the robustness of military operational plans by \nlearning boundaries from simulated and evaluated plan \ninstances from a simulation-based decision support system. \nU sing a series of computational processing steps, such as \ncalculating distances between all plans based on their \ncharacteristics and outcomes, clustering all plans with Potts \nspin neural clustering 


using those distances, performing \nevidential model screening of all actions as to their \ndifferentiating capacity between different clusters of plans, \nusing SVM to learn support vectors from clusters of screened nplan instances, and deriving hyperplanes from these support \nvectors, we provide decision support regarding the risk of \nfailure as measured by the distance from a plan during \nexecution towards the closest hyperplane nXI.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

Thakor  \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Translating Revolutionary Prosthesis to  \nPractical Prosthesis \n \nAbstract The Revolutionary Prosthesis Program by DARPA helped launch a revolu-\ntion in prosthetics technology and means for controlling the advanced dexterous \nlimbs, up with to 22 degrees of freedom.  That has necessitated the challenge of con-\ntrolling the limb with such superior dexterity.  I will introduce methods for dexterous nprosthesis control, from myoelectric to cortical \(EEG, Electrocorticogram, neural \nspike, local field potential incorporating multimodal sensors, such as camera and video tracking, may lead to more functional \nand practical prosthesis control. Emerging challenge now is to make the revolutionary prosthetics, practi-\ncal affordable and available for amputees today. I will present our affofdable prosthetic limb solution de-\nveloped with funding from the NIH Small Business Innovations Research \(SBIR hybrid solution, such as using RFID, for dexterous hand function. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Nitish V.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
