In this scenario one of the main problems is to detect which elements should be changed due to a given change. This paper presents an approach that applies data mining over a versioned UML repository in order to detect change patterns among model elements at different abstraction levels. These patterns are presented to the software ntextual information obtained from a change control system, so he can decide the software evolution task at hand    1  Introduction  The software development process encompasses many distinct phases, each of them working on a specific abstraction level. Some decades ago, completely different paradigms were used to construct artifacts in these different phases of the development process. Fortunately, in the last decades some paradigms, such as object-oriented, aspect-oriented and component-based have tried to reduce the gap between the problem definition and its solution. Besides the chosen paradigm te for representing analysis and design artifacts [1-3   H o w e v e r  software engineers must ensure that all UML artifacts are up to date and consistent throughout the abstraction levels to avoid misunderstandings Traceability techniques can be used to solve this problem by identifying all UML model elements that shall be updated when a change is introduced [4  B y  analyzing the traceability links, the software engineer can identify the potential side-effects of a new change estimating what should be modified to accomplish a proposed change. Moreover, traceability links detection at analysis and design levels helps software engineers to identify bad design decisions early on the software development process and provides a high l view of the system dependencies [5   The traceability link detection approaches based on data mining [6-8 usua l l y s e a r c h f o r c o nc o m it a n t changes in Software Configuration Management SCM\systems to discover possible dependencies among software artifacts. SCM techniques are commonly used to control the evolution of software systems by providing versioning, via Version Control Systems \(VCS\, and support for activities related to change management, via Change Control Systems \(CCS Our work uses a data mining technique named association rules, which extracts sets of items that frequently occur in the database transactions. Table 1 shows how each data mining term is related to our approach. In the classical usage context of data mining all sales are analyzed to detect buying patterns among different customers. These patterns indicate which er. In our approach, items are represented by UML model elements Therefore, the mined database is a versioned UML repository that stores changes performed during the development and maintenance phases. Moreover, each database transaction is mapped to a change, implemented via one or more check-in operations This paper is organized in four sections besides this introduction. Section 2 describes our approach for change traces detection via association rule data mining technique over versioned UML repositories. Section 3 presents some related works. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper presenting some future works  Table 1.

 2  Mining UML repositories  This section introduces the proposed approach for traceability link detection among UML model elements, which encloses mining of change traces and gathering of rationale behind the change traces  2.1  Change traces  Change traces are defined as traceability links obtained from change information. Throughout the lifecyd when new features are added or bugs are fixed. All these changes are stored in CCS and VCS In the context of CCS, changes have a predefined lifecycle, determined by the SCM activities [9  1  change request, \(2\classification, \(3\ analysis, \(4 evaluation, \(5\mplementation, \(6\erification, and \(7 integration. During the implementation phase of this re artifacts are modified to perform the change. Each version of the modified artifacts is stored in VCS. Along with the versioned artifacts, other information is kept by VCS, such as change description, author, and date of each check-in operation performed during the change implementation In a previous work, an infrastructure named Odyssey-VCS [1 w a s de f i n e d to v e r s ion U M L m ode l e l e ments. The integration of information provided by CCS and Odyssey-VCS allows the detection of which arti When a requested change is implemented, distinct artifacts are modified at different abstraction levels Figure 1 shows two types of change traces that can be obtained by our approach: intra-model and inter-model   Figure 1. Change traces  The intra-model change trace relates two or more elements in the same abstraction level. For example, it is possible to detect that two use cases are always changed together. On the other hand, inter-model change trace relates two or more elements in different abstraction levels. For example, it is possible to detect that a use case and a class are always changed together  2.2  Traceability links rationale  While developers investigate change traces, they pose various questions to uncover the rationale of dependencies that were identified. Currently, most approaches that support traceability lacks to provide the semantics of the relations among software artifacts. To minimize this problem, our approach provides a view of all related artifacts that shall be updated and the details about the rationale, the history, and the people behind the change traces. Such details are vital in assisting developers to understand the state of the software system throughout the evolution process [1  This rationale follows an information structure widely used in the Computer Supported Cooperative Work literature to contextualize and provide knowledge about elements [12  T h is i n fo r m at io n s t r u ct u r e i s  known as 5W+1H and comprises the following pieces of information: who, when, where, why, what, and how For example, the knowledge of who has performed a change may assist developers to understand if the change trace was introduced by a senior developer Moreover, even if the change trace were introduced by a senior developer, other questions may indicate that this change trace was introduced to fix a critical bug in the few days/hours before a release, lacking adherence rds used in the company However, in the real world of software development, manually recording such information is neither possible nor practical. On the other hand, SCM repositories store change details obtained from SCM activities presented in Section 2.1. These change details are automatically collected and organized by our approach to provide the required 5W+1H information, as shown in Table 2  Table 2. Rationale gathering Information type Collection place  Who 200  Check-in information from VCS 200  Implementation activity from CCS When 200  Check-in information from VCS 200  Implementation activity from CCS How 200  Impact analysis from CCS Why 200  Change request activity from CCS What 200  Check-in information from VCS 200  Verification activity from CCS Where 200  Check-in information from VCS  The automatic gathering of 5W+1H information depends on another previous work named Odyssey-CCS Change request  Change Control System \(CCS Version Control System \(VCS  Analysis Design Intra-model traces Inter-model traces Code Proceedings of the 2005 Eighth Inter national Workshop on Principles of Software Evolution \(IWPSE\22205 1550-4077/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


 10  w h ich i s  a C C S t h at al lo w s p r o ces s  an d  in f o rm ation customization. Our work uses Odyssey-CCS to collect the rationale information shown in Table 2. For each required piece of information, the gathering place should be defined in terms of the field inside a specific document that stores the information in Odyssey-CCS For example, to collect the \215why\216 information using a conventional SCM process [9 e f i eld 215 c h a n g e d e scription\216 in the document \215change request\216 should be inspected  2.3  Process for traceability links detection  The process for traceability links detection comprises two main phases: configuration and querying The configuration phase is when the configuration manager sets the desired data mining metrics and informs the activities and fields of CCS that should be used to collect rationale information, as mentioned in the previous section The querying phase occurs when developers want to know the change traces among UML model elements Usually, a UML model element is selected and all traceability links for this element are provided. This mechanism helps to answer questions such as \215Developers that change a given element also change which other elements?\216, providing support for the developers\220 future changes It is important to notice that this approach does not intend to replace the work of software engineers. Since change traces are based on past experience, they do not constitute absolute truth, but suggestions. To categorize the relevance of these sugge stions, each change trace has a probabilistic interpretation based on the amount of evidence from the data that they are derived from This evidence can be represented by two data mining metrics: support and confidence. These metrics are used to mine only frequent rules in databases Support  quantifies the significance of the \(co-\ccurrence of artifacts in implemented changes Confidence represents how much one artifact depends on others Typically, association rules techniques are interested in rules that satisfy both minimum support and confidence thresholds. In our approach, such thresholds should be set by the configuration manager at the configuration phase The process for mining change traces related to the selected model element comprises two steps: \(1\election of changes that will be analyzed, and \(2\ mining the transactions, searching for rules that describe relationships between UML model elements Only changes that satisfy the following conditions are analyzed by the data mining algorithm: \(1\e change should be completely implemented, \(2\ the change should be older than the UML model element loper, and \(3\he change should affect the UML model element that is been queried by the developer After that, our approach can apply data mining over the changes selected according to the above conditions The data mining algorithm calculates the support and confidence metrics for each pair of artifacts which are included in the changes and, then, prunes the elements with support and confidence lower than the minimum thresholds Our approach presents, together with the mined traceability links, the rationale behind each change trace, as shown in Figure 2. The rationale is composed by the 5W+1H information \(shown in Table 2\ collected from every change that participates in the mining of each detected change trace   Figure 2. Detected change traces  3  Related work  In the last decade, researchers have experienced the use of SCM repositories to understand software as well as their evolution. Gall et al. [13 u s e r e l eas e d a ta t o  detect logical coupling between modules. Ball et al 1 h a ve p e r f o r m e d so m e c l uste r  a n a l y s is o f  C    A similar work has been conducted later by Bieman et al. [15  o n  clas s e s  of a commercial system. In this work, they identify change-prone classes that are targets for re-engineering Some works also perform historical analysis over SCM repositories. Shirabad et al. [7 use  i nduc t i ve learning to find out different concepts of relevance among logically coupled files. Eick et al. [16 arg u e that code decay is related to the difficulty to perform history applying decay indexes to identify risk factors.

 heim et al. [17 a r g u e  t h at p r o d u ct q u a li ty i s d e p e n d en t of process quality. Due to this argument, the development process activities are analyzed and some metrics are applied over VCS. Finally, Zimmermann et al  have evidenced that mining SCM repositories can be useful for suggesting and predicting likely further changes, detecting hidden dependencies, and preventing errors due to incomplete changes However, these related approaches work over filebased SCM repositories. For this reason, they lack support for traceability links detection of fine-grained UML model elements. Moreover, they do not provide change traces rationale, automatically extracted from an integrated CCS and VCS infrastructure  4  Conclusion  This paper presented an approach for the detection l elements. This approach can contribute to the impact analysis activity avoiding under-prediction of the scope of a change and helping to identify critical side-effects. Also, it can indicate anomalies in the design structure which may be subject to restructuring if a change trace between two classes of different components is detected Some positive aspects of our approach are: \(1 automatic change traces detection; \(2\use of UML model elements as mining units, leveraging the state of the art to fine-grained analysis and design artifacts; and 3\escription of change traces rationale using the 5W+1H structure, automatically collected from an integrated CCS and VCS infrastructure Our future work includes the summarization of the reasoning information. This feature will allow, for example, detecting which developer is the main expert for a given artifact due to the number of changes he/she has previously performed in this artifact. Moreover, we intend to perform some case studies to verify how the benefits and limitations of our approach affect the maintenance tasks in a real usage scenario  5  References  1  D  D'S o u za an d  A.

Thus it is more ef?cient, as can be seen in Table 2. The execution time in the case of allowing two insertions is only about thrice that for one insertion Up to now, we only investigated how to edit an item set by insertion. However, there are also other interesting editing operations.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
