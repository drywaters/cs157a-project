parallelism by distributing the data being mined across all available processors Keywords data mining candidate, itemsets, parallel I Introduction Data mining or knowledge discovery in database DD has in the recent years attracted a lot of interest in the database community The interest is motivated by the large amount of computerized data that many organizations now have about their business For instance supermarkets store electronic copies of millions of receipts and banks and credit card companies maintain extensive transaction histones The goal in database mining is to analymthese frequent data sets and to discover 
patterns or regularities that are useful for decision support Dis~~~,~r3.--cf--~~~~~.~t~o~.~.r~les is one of the most important data mining problem for example given a database of sales transactions it would be intended to discover all associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of other items in the same transaction The problem of mining Association rules in the context of database was first explored in Agrawal et a1.,1993 The mathematical model of association rules is: let I=[il i2  i be a set of literals 
call items let D be a set of transaction where each Ransaction T is a set of items such that Td the quantities of items bought in a hensaction are not considered this mean that each item is a binary variable representing if an item was bought each transaction is associated with an identifier called TID Let X be a set of items A transaction is said to contain X if and only if XGT An association rule is an implication of the form X=>Y where Xc I Yd and X n Y 
4 The rule X=>Y holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if c of transaction in D that contains X also contains Y The rule X=>Y has support s in the transaction set D ifs of transactions in D contain XU Y Confidence c denotes the strength of implication and support indicates the frequencies of the occumng patterns in the rule. It is often desirable to pay attention to only those rules which may have reasonably large support, are referred to as strong rules \(Agrawal et al 1993 The task of mining association 0-7803-7840-7/031$17.00 
02003 EEE rules is essentially to discover strong association rules in large database In general the problem of mining association rules is decomposed into the following two steps I Discovery the frequent item sets. i.e the sets of item sets that have transaction support above a pre-determined minimum supports 2 Use the frequent item sets to generahle the It is noted that the overall performance of mining association rules is determined by the first step After the frequent item sets are identified the corresponding association rules can be derived in a straightforward manner Efficient count of frequent item 
sets is that the focus of most prior work association rules for the database II Apriori Algorithm Fig 1 gives the Apriori algorithm The first pass of the algorithm simply counts item occurrences to determine the large 1-items A subsequent pass, say pass k consists of two phases First the large itemsets L found in the k-1 pass are used to generate the candidate itemsets Ck using the Apriorisen function Next the database is scanned and the support of candidate in Ck is counted I*.Apriori Algorithm  CL set of candidate K-itemsets Each member of this set 
has two fields Lk set of frequent k-itemsets Each member of this set has two fields i itemset and ii support count I i itemset and ii support count  LI frequent, 1-itemsets For k=2;L k-l#O;k do begin Cl;apriori_gen\(Lk- l\candidate For all transaction teD do begin Increment the count of all candidates in Ck that are end Lk ceCklc.count>minsup end Answer=ukLk insert into Ck select piteml p.item2  p.itemk-I q.itemk-1 from Lk-lp Lk-lq where p.iteml=q.iteml  p.itemk-l=q.itemk-l I pitemk-l<q.itemk-l prune step contained in t I*Apriori_gen function 844

All that is needed now is the perform a parallel vector sum of the arrays This only requires communication count values and can be done in O\(log\(n communication steps Number of prhcessor 1 3 IV Results Sequential Recessing Panllel fiocessing Sped time time 0.561s 0.191s 2.973

  10 launched on the same 2110 Taurus vehicle configuration in 1999 with the KOMPSAT satellite  Orbital has flown numerous missions from the Mission Operations Center \(MOC\lles using the MAESTRO ground software for command and telemetry. The MOC is shown below in Figure 10. This software is hosted on Sun workstations running the Solaris operating system. The most recent missions are OV-3 and GALEX. Both programs are running smoothly and operating as planned. ACRIMSAT has recently converted over to using the MAESTRO system for operations as well. USN is supporting the GALEX mission, including X-band pass services at Hawaii and Australia. Glory will follow this proven path. USN has also supported most of Orbital’s geo-synchronous satellite launches and on orbit checkouts    Figure 10 – Orbital’s Mission Operations Center  6  S UMMARY   In the case of the Glory program, it is concluded that reuse of many components from the VCL program not only significantly reduces the cost of the Glory mission but helps to make something of what could be shelved for an indeterminate amount of time.  By employing existing resources and knowledge from a program that was very mature, the Glory program is doing its part to contribute to cost saving measures and maximizing benefit to NASA. The Glory program provides savings of nearly $15M over a ground-up bus design effort, while mitigating significant risk on the bus portion of the mission  Glory is an ideal mission for ear th sciences in the realm of climate change research. It draws from significant flight heritage elements in both th e instruments and the spacecraft bus. It uses an existing NASA asset with minor refurbishment to save significant development costs. It uses a LV that has flown several NASA and DOD missions to date. The ground system employs flight proven hardware and software with a robust plan for backup coverage   7  R EFERENCES   NASA Facts Aerosols June 1999   NASA Godda rd Space Flight Center Glory Program Science and Mission Requirements Document  Greenbelt, Maryland, February 2, 2004  8  B IOGRAPHIES   Darcie A.

Itchkawich is a Program Director working for the VP of Science and Technology Programs in the Space Systems Group at Orbital Sciences Corporation in Dulles Virginia. Tom is currently managing the operations support for ACRIMSAT managing the Glory program at Orbital, and managing an internal ERP conversion in his spare time. He has successfully launched the Mighty Sat I satellite on the Shuttle Endeavour, and the ACRIMSAT satellite on Taurus. He has supported numerous other programs at both CTA Space Systems and Orbital Sciences. In a previous incarnation he was the lead engineer for the Pegasus payload fairing from inception through design, fabrication, qualification testing and the first four flights. A true Fighting Blue Hen, Tom graduated with a Bachelor’s of Mechanical Engineering from the University of Delaware. The first ten years of his career were spent at Hercules Aerospace working on composite rocket motor cases, including Titan IVB, Delta GEM strap-ons, and Filament Wound Case Shuttle boosters. Tom was part of the Pegasus Team that was awarded the National Medal of Technology, and the MightySat team that was awarded the Program of the Quarter by AFRL. He has several other published papers on composite structures and low-cost satellite missions
