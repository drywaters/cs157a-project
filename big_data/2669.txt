Powers and Lucy Y. Pao1 Abstract  Of signi?cant interest in the practical application of data association algorithms to target tracking in cluttered environments is how to determine track-loss in the absence of truth data. An approach is laid out for the Probabilistic Data Association Filter where the predicted measurement innovations covariance is used to de?ne nominal  tracking  and  track-lost  regimes, and the sample variance of the  effective  lter innovations \(prediction errors used to determine the regime in a two-class decision rule. A major advantage of this method is that con?dence intervals can be placed on the probabilities of both correctly and incorrectly identifying the regimes. Theoretical approximations of the conditional mean and distribution of the sample innovations variance in the tracking and track-lost regimes are proposed for use in construction of the decision rule. Simulation results demonstrating the method are provided I. INTRODUCTION Real-world sensors often report more than one measurement that may be from a given target. These may either be measurements of the desired target or  clutter  measurements. Clutter refers to detections or returns from nearby objects, clouds, electromagnetic interference, acoustic anomalies, false alarms, etc. While the Probabilistic Data Association Filter \(PDAF  KF the estimate eventually diverges from the true track due to measurement origin uncertainty. Although there is a continuum of behavior, the operation of the PDAF is often divided into two regimes, non-divergent  tracking   divergent  track-lost   de?ning the transition  track-loss   regimes themselves In simulation, two metrics commonly used to de?ne the transition between the two regimes are [12]: 1 tive distance of the estimate from the truth, and 2 the truth measurement to  gate  Gating is a commonly used method of limiting the number of measurements processed by considering only those within some normative distance of the predicted measurement. In practice, neither of these metrics is applicable, as neither the true state nor the truth measurement is known. However, theory does show differences between the two regimes that can be exploited to build track-loss metrics that do not require having truth knowledge [5], [7], [9 1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado at Boulder, richard.m.powers@colorado.edu and pao@colorado.edu This work was supported in part by the U.S. Of?ce of Naval Research Grant N00014-02-1-0136 In the absence of truth data, ?ve \(linked available from the PDAF as track-loss metrics are the KF gain, the state estimate error covariance, the predicted state estimate error covariance, the predicted measurement innovations covariance, and the actual measurement innovations The ?rst four quantities might be said to de?ne the  lter status  Previously, detection of track-loss in the absence of truth data has been done by testing the normality of the measurement innovations [7]. In this paper, the overall strategy is to construct a two-class \(Neyman-Pearson decision rule which determines the operating regime of the PDAF by comparing the sample variance of recent  effective  measurement innovations to a function of the theoretical predicted measurement innovations covariance in each regime. A major advantage of this method is that con?dence intervals can be placed on the probabilities of both correctly and incorrectly identifying the regimes This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the 


This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the PDAF for linear time invariant \(LTI De?nitions of the tracking and track-lost regimes are made based on mean ?lter statuses constructed using deterministic approximations to the PDAF. In Section III, a twoclass decision rule \(regime test the sample variance of recent prediction errors to the theoretical predicted measurement innovations covariance for each track regime in order to make an assignment The decision rule is based on the mean and distribution of the sample variance of prediction errors conditioned on the regime of operation. Toward this purpose, a single measurement prediction error must be de?ned for the PDAF the  effective  measurement innovation. An example of this approach is provided in Section IV, and simulation results and conclusions are presented in Sections V and VI II. TRACK REGIME MODELING VIA SCALAR INFORMATION REDUCTION FACTOR APPROXIMATIONS In this section, an LTI model of the system to be tracked the Kalman ?lter, and the PDAF are reviewed. The basis of models of the tracking and track-lost regimes are then created using deterministic scalar information reduction factor SIRF the Kalman ?lter [2], [3], [4], [11 A.

Predicting the Filter Status With a SIRF Approximation It is possible to use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the lter status of the PDAF in each track regime. However simulation is time-consuming and computationally intensive, and the results are applicable only to the particular system and operating point. It would be preferable to have a model that predicts the ?lter status for each regime The ?lter status is a complex stochastic function of the gate and measurements, but a deterministic approximation to the estimate error covariance P\(k|k  3], [4], [9], [11 P\(k|k k|k ? 1 k k k k 17 4317

Note that ? ? 0 as ?Vk ? 0. Thus in the track-lost regime the covariance estimate will grow without bound while there are no clutter measurements being gated 4318 while being bounded when clutter measurements are gated which is the observed trend Note also that \(32 at least one measurement will fall inside the gate not true for  small  values of ?, as there is commonly a signi?cant probability that no measurements will gate for any given timestep. From \(4 8 consistent to interpret the case of no measurements gating as zero prediction error; however, the resulting overall distribution of prediction errors is then non-Gaussian While more sophisticated approximations have been developed [9] that make better estimates of track lifetime, this approximation makes acceptable steady-state predictions of the nominal ?lter status in both the tracking and track-lost regimes. The computational burden of using these SIRF approximations is signi?cantly less than that of Monte Carlo simulation of the system G. Extensions to Other Data Association Methods This strategy is suitable for other data association methods, though the derivation may be dif?cult. For example, a model for track-lifetime prediction of the Nearest Neighbor method [10] could be adopted in much the same way. Even if no suitable theoretical model is available for the data association method in question, it may be possible to use simulation to obtain functions for ?T\(?Vk Vk III. A TRACK REGIME DECISION RULE 


III. A TRACK REGIME DECISION RULE In this section, a two-class \(Neyman-Pearson rule is developed which classi?es the regime of operation as either tracking or track-lost based on the  steady-state  predicted covariance of measurement innovations S for each regime and the sample variance, s2, of the  effective  measurement innovations, ?e?\(k a con?dence levels for the classi?cation A. Candidate Statistical Tests If there are two hypotheses HT and HL, and two operating classes \(regimes possible outcomes to the hypothesis assignment 1 2 3 4 The con?dence level is the a posteriori probability of a correct assignment, that is the a posteriori probability of either case \(1 4 The commonly used maximum a posteriori \(MAP imum probability of error \(MPE require knowledge of both the a priori probabilities, P \(C as well as the conditional probabilities, P \(H |C if only the conditional probabilities are known \(as is the case here The conditional probability densities can be approximated using the SIRF approximations B. A Model for the Distribution of the Sample Variances Consider of the j-th element of the ?lter prediction error denoted ?j . The unbiased sample variance of ?j over n timesteps is s2?j 1 n? 1 n i=1 j\(i  j 33 Assuming that within a given regime the prediction errors pe which is only an approximation in the case of data association theoretical variance of ?j then n? 1 2?j  1 2?j n i=1 j\(i  j 34 is ?2 distributed with n ? 1 degrees of freedom, so the probability density function of s2?j is n?1 2 j  n?3 exp  n?1 2 j 2 ?2 j  2 j n?1 n?1 n?12 for s2?j &gt; 0 35 C. Neyman-Pearson Rule for the Prediction Errors The Neyman-Pearson rule for each ?j is then [6 


The Neyman-Pearson rule for each ?j is then [6 Decide track-lost if P \(s2?j |HL P \(s2?j |HT gt; ?np \(36 Decide tracking if P \(s2?j |HL P \(s2?j |HT lt; ?np where ?np is the Neyman-Pearson threshold, which is to be determined. Substituting \(35 s 2 j HL P \(s2 j HT  2?j HT 2 j HL  n?1 exp  n?1 2 2?j HL 2?j |HT 2 j HT 2?j |HL  37 so taking the natural log of \(36 the decision rule Decide track-lost if f\(?np 38 Decide tracking if f\(?np where f\(?np 2 n? 1 2?j |HT 2?j |HL 2?j |HL 2?j |HT 39  ln  2?j |HL 2?j |HT  n?1 np   Since the primary focus is on detecting the track-lost regime, the associated probabilities for the hypothesis assignments are de?ned [6 1 HL|CL 4319 2 HL|CT 3 HT|CL 4 HT|CT and these probabilities are related by PMISS = 1? PDET \(40 PFA = 1? PCD Note that PDET, the probability of the test detecting the track-lost regime, is not to be confused with PD, the probability of the truth measurement being detected by the lter. In the observation space [6 PFA

in four unknowns: n, ?np, \(?2?j |HT 2?j |HL The Neyman-Pearson decision rule is said to maximize the probability of detecting the track-lost regime, PDET for a given n, subject to the constraint that PFA is less than or equal to some user-de?ned probability. [6]. However, it is convenient in this context to instead ?x both PDET and PFA at some desired values, and use \(41 43 the corresponding minimum \(integer n that must be used in order to meet these goals. Typically there is a range of values of ?np that will achieve them Appropriate values of n and ?np can be determined for each pe element ?j using \(41 43 determinations for each element can then be made using 38 39 for each pe element; if a single overall track-loss metric is desired, Wishart distributed versions of \(33 35 also be used in the development of the Neyman-Pearson decision rule. However, because of the approximate nature of the distribution in \(35 additional covariance information is useful in the matrix likelihood test [5]. Further, a Wishart implementation has the disadvantage of being more computationally intensive than the implementation outlined above D. Application to the PDAF In order to implement the Neyman-Pearson rule, \(15 be rewritten x  k|k  k|k ? 1 k k 44 where, for the PDAF e?\(k  mk i=1 i zi\(k 1? ?0  k|k ? 1   45 This  effective  measurement innovation is then the single lter prediction error for purposes of calculating the sample variances s2?j . The j-th diagonal of the innovations covariance for the tracking regime, ST?sirf , and track-lost regime SL?sirf , can then be used for \(?2?j |HT 2?j |HL respectively Some method of handling the case of no gated measurements must be implemented. As suggested earlier, it is at least mathematically consistent in this case to de?ne the measurement innovations as zero. However, when there is a signi?cant probability of zero measurements gating the assumption that the prediction errors have a Gaussian distribution will be a poor one; in practice, this probability is likely to be signi?cant both when PD &lt; 1 and when in the track-lost regime. So the goals for PDET and PFA will not generally be met unless the innovations from timesteps when no measurements gate are excluded, and it is necessary to use the previous nC timesteps to ?nd n nonzero innovations with which to compute s2?j . The average number of timesteps n  T used when the ?lter is operating in the tracking regime is approximately n/\(PDPG average number of timesteps n  L used to when the ?lter is in the track-lost regime is problem speci?c E. Extensions to Other Data Association Methods This strategy is suitable for other data association methods. For the NN ?lter, the KF measurement innovations are the prediction errors. For MAP and maximum likelihood ML determined by similarly deriving a relationship between the estimated state, predicted state, and Kalman gain IV. EXAMPLE: PDAF TRACK REGIME TEST In this section, an example system using the PDAF is constructed. The SIRF approximation steady-state innovations covariances for the tracking and track-lost regimes are calculated and compared to simulation results. An example 


calculated and compared to simulation results. An example Neyman-Pearson decision rule is determined. Theoretical and simulation results for the probabilities of detection of the track-lost regime, PDET, and of false alarm while in the tracking regime, PFA, are given. An estimate of the number of timesteps required to detect track-loss is also provided 4320 A.

Clutter and Gating Though the example system is dependent on Q,R and ?, it can be described in the tracking regime using just three independent parameters [12]: the probability of detecting the truth measurement, PD, the normalized target acceleration, \(NTA sity, \(NCD the target is maneuvering, and NCD is a measure of how dif?cult it is to localize the target from the measurements For the example system, NTA = 1. Choosing PD = 1 0.02 results in NCD = 0.002, and an average track-lifetime of approximately 500 timesteps using the PDAF [8], [12 this is a tracking problem of  moderate  dif?culty for the example dynamics Using a four standard deviation gate \(? = 16 PG = 0.99994. For the example system, nz = 1, cnz = 2 and Vk = 8 |S\(k D. Experimental Tracking and Track-lost Regimes The following experimental setup allows for  controlled  track-loss and is used to verify operation of the trackloss detector. Until timestep 1000, the ?lter is tracking in the sense that PD = 1 \(the truth measurement is always 


available to the gating test 2000, PD = 0 \(the truth measurement is never available to the gating test sense that the truth measurement is never gated. PFA can then be calculated using measurement innovations from the rst 1000 timesteps, and PDET from using measurement innovations from the second 1000 timesteps, with roughly 1000 values of s2?j being tested by the decision rule in each regime. Note that PDET is thus calculated using both data points from the transient of  controlled  track-loss as well as from the  steady-state  operation of the ?lter in the tracklost regime E.

In general, it has been observed that the approximation for the tracking regime is more accurate than for the track-lost regime when compared to the simulation results 4321 G. Neyman-Pearson Decision Rule PDET ? 0.99 and PFA ? 0.01 are reasonable targets for the decision rule. The number of effective innovations n necessary to meet these goals can be calculated by incrementing n until, for some value\(s and PFA ? 0.01 \(see Figure 2 the slope of the curve is ?np 0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.975 0.98 0.985 0.99 0.995 1 target PD &amp; PFA PFA P D n=6 n=7 n=8 Fig. 2.

Though the actual process of track-loss is dif?cult to quantify, the experimental results n  T = 7.0 and n  L = 24.9 do provide some insight into the number of timesteps necessary for track-loss detection, as the average number of timesteps necessary, n  Loss, should be bounded by n  T ? n  Loss ? n  L V. SIMULATION RESULTS Table 1 provides a comparison of experimental values for PDET, PFA, n  T, and n  F across large ranges of NTA and NCD for PDAF simulation data when PD = 1. For each NTA-NCD combination, n and ?np have been chosen such that, theoretically, PDET ? 0.99 and PFA ? 0.01, with n as small as possible. The mean track-lifetime of all NTA-NCD combinations is approximately 100 timesteps where NCD is labeled  High  1000 timesteps where NCD is labeled  Medium  and 10,000 timesteps where NCD is labeled  Low  12]. The experimental values of PDET, and PFA were calculated using the means of 25 trials of the example experimental setup; trials were selected from realizations where track-loss did not occur until forced at timestep 1001 


where track-loss did not occur until forced at timestep 1001 Having the tracking and track-lost variances of the innovations spaced well apart is the condition for small n As Table 1 shows, this condition is met less often for low values of NTA In the track-lost regime, the assumption that the validated prediction errors are Gaussian distributed is usually quite conservative since the sample variances are generally larger than for a Gaussian distribution. This contributes to generally exceeding the PDET goals. Conversely, the sample variances in the tracking regime, while more Gaussian are still somewhat larger than would be expected from a Gaussian distribution, meaning that the PFA goals may not always be met. However, because n is restricted to integer values, the theoretical values of both PDET and PFA often exceed the desired values signi?cantly for low values of n Unlike the tracking regime, the track-lost regime cannot be described solely in terms of PD , NTA, and NCD. SL is non-linearly dependent on ?, so n, PDET, and PFA vary with ? as well. This can be seen by comparing the Medium NTA results in Table 1 with those in Table 2, where identical values of PD , NTA, and NCD constructed from different values of Q, R, and ? yield different results for n In general, lowering PD increases the tracking regime innovations variance ST?sirf , reducing the separation from SL?sirf and thus having the tendency to raise the required n to meet the goals for PDET and PFA. This can be seen by comparing the Low NTA data in Table 1 \(PD = 1 Table 3 \(PD = 0.9 Over the parameter space explored, the test \(decision rule VI. CONCLUSION AND ONGOING WORK A strategy has been laid out for creating a two-class decision rule to determine the regime of operation for the PDAF in the absence of truth data. Scalar information reduction factors can be used in an iterative scheme to predict the steady-state innovations covariance for both the tracking and track-lost regimes, which results in lower computational burden when compared to Monte Carlo simulation. Then a distribution can be assumed for the sample variances of the prediction errors. Together, these pieces of information constitute a model around which a Neyman-Pearson decision rule can be constructed, where the con?dences in both the probability of track-loss detection and of false alarms are explicitly chosen. Good performance of the test as a trackloss detector was demonstrated for an example system over a large range of tracking dif?culties Ongoing work includes modeling the effective innovations \(45 theoretical distributions for the prediction errors used in the decision rule \(38 desirable to more accurately model the sample distribution of the innovations variance, and it has been shown that the prediction errors of many data association algorithms can be well approximated by a Gaussian mixture [13 REFERENCES 1] Y.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
