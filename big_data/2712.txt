Introduction and paper organization The Tropospheric Infrared Mapping Spectrometers \(TIMS were developed and demonstrated with support of the NASA ESTO instrument incubator project IIP-04-0081 and with internal Lockheed Martin support. These comprise two spectrometers operating at 2.33 and 4.68 \265m developed to demonstrate retrieval of atmospheric CO in several layers 
Here we focus on the 2.3 TIMS demonstration unit  will describe the top level design of the spectrometer in Section 2 and summarize successive 2.3 TIMS demonstrations of increasing maturity in Section 3 However the focus of the paper is to develop and validate an instrument noise model \(see Section 4\ against the 2.3 TIMS data. The validation is described in Section 5. Then in Section 6 we describe the geoCARB 4-channel space application of the technology and use the validated noise model to predict its performance The best data set we have for that purpose was obtained in a joint campaign with the University of Denver \(DU\heir 
facility in late May 2008. We will describe the laboratory set up in which the data were acquired, the data acquisition procedure, and the measurement and calibration procedures It demonstrated \(a\pectra at resolution 0.25 cm-1 on the range 4280 to 4302 cm-1 \(i.e., 2324.5 to 2336.4 nm average sample spacing of  about 0.035 cm-1; and \(b noise equivalent spectral radiance NESR of about 6.43 nW/\(cm 2 sr cm 1 he measurement procedure used a 1-sec integration time and two ganged pixels along the slit in order to simulate GEO-CAPE [2 o p e ratio n   T h is w ill b e  further explained in the main discussion below. Also in the main discussion we describe a model of the instrument that 
provides agreement with the DU campaign observations of both the signal and the noise. It utilizes the parameters: focal plane assembly \(FPA\el area, - system focal ratio end to end system optical transmission including grating efficiency, -spectral band width per spectral sample, -slit to pixel  width ratio, -quantum efficiency, -integration time, read noise and dark current, and - number of ganged pixels For the lab set up at DU the noise was dominated by the uncooled spectrometer thermal photon shot noise.  Signal photons shot noise was secondary but could be measured with reasonable accuracy. Two types of signal including a 
calibrated black body and a diffuser that was illuminated by direct sunlight were utilized for the study. The FPA was LN2 cooled so dark current shot noise and the read noise were much, much less than the thermal photon shot noise In contrast, in a space application the spectrometer would be cooled enough 245 K\uch that thermal photon shot noise would be reduced to negligible and similar the dark current shot noise by suitably cooling the FPA. Then for a 


  2 large fraction of the mission data, the signal photon shot noise would be dominant, with read noise and other noise sources not related to the signal beginning to play a role in marginally low light level cases For the geoCARB application we use the validated instrument noise model to demonstrate its SNR is 100 for an example of very low light level illumination per spectral sample and instrument footprint defined by cos\(SZA 0.025 where is the surface albedo and SZA is the solar zenith angle. For the far more common illumination levels which can sometimes be as high as cos\(SZA 0.6, the SNR can approach 800 2. The TIMS spectrometer design concept The design concept evolved from previous work with an all refractive Littrow spectrometer as described by Roche et al 3 P r eli m i n ar y s t u d y s u g g ested t h at t h e trad itio n a l a l l  reflective Littrow moun w i t h s m all corrector len s es t o  optimize optical quality as shown in Figure 1 would provide a more compact package. A proposal to develop this approach for mapping retrieved layers of atmospheric CO was submitted to a NASA ESTO Instrument Incubator Program opportunity and resulted in the award IIP-04-0081 This produced and demonstrated the first generation of the TIMS instrumentation  The final 2.3 TIMS spectrometer configuration is shown in Figure 2. For further perspective the TIMS hardware with the top of the spectrometer removed is shown in Figure 3 Relative to Figure 1 new features include 200  A telescope assembly focusing the scene onto the slit To reduce stray light it has provision for a low quality intermediate image \(LQII\e and a pupil stop. It is also a place for a dichroic beam splitter if that would be deemed desirable 200  A powered mirror replaces the corrector lens in the input beam to the Littrow 200  The Littrow mirror output to an LQII plane is also a new feature 200  The relay optics from that LQII to the FPA were introduced to eliminate clash of the grating  Figure 1 \226 Illustrates the preliminary TIMS concept  Figure 2 \226 Illustrates the final 2.3 TIMS design schematic 80.00   MM Low quality intermediate image \(LQII Region to place a pupil stop and or a dichroic beam splitter \(DBS and or an order sorting filter slit Powered input mirror Littrow mirror Input light grating LQII Place for DBS Collimating lens Dewar window filter focusing lens FPA

Summary of successively maturing demonstrations In the demonstration of TIMS technology there are four distinct TIMS demonstration maturity milestones that we\222ll briefly summarize here, the results of the  200  2008 joint measurements campaign with DU 200  2010 TIMS deployment on an airship 200  Installation of a corrected collimating lens in 2011 200  Demonstration that FPA cooling with an LM ATC mechanical cooler did not measurably increase the zero signal FPA noise The 2008 joint measurements campaign with DU A major result was the demonstration of a successful and validated retrieval of CO and CH4 columns with precisions of 17.2 and 1.86 %, respectively. This is reported in Kumer  l s o t h ere it w as rep o rted th at th e s e w o u l d s cale to precisions improved by a factor of 2 down to 8.6 and 0.93 respectively, on viewing a scene with cos\(SZA\ = 0.1 in a space application. In Section 5 we provide further detail for that scaling process In this subsection we will discuss some data that did not make it into reference [1 u e to p ag e li m itat i o n i n clu d i n g  200  Validation of the TIMS spectra with near simultaneously acquired DU spectra 200  Some insight to the contribution of CO to the spectral measurement Validation vs DU measured spectra 227The data we will focus on were obtained on the morning of 30 May 2008. At approximately the same time DU personnel were obtaining direct solar viewing data with the stroke of their Bruker Fourier transform spectrometer \(FTS\hortened such that their spectral resolution was 0.25 cm-1.  The stroke was selected because data obtained earlier in the campaign had indicated this should match well with the spectral resolution of the TIMS data. The TIMS optical design was specified to optimize on the wave number range  4281 to 4301 where the best CO lines are located. Partly due to this specification the TIMS spectral resolution degrades rapidly for 4302 cm 1 The TIMS and the DU data are shown plotted on the spectral range 4280 to 4302 on Figure 6. A wave number independent multiplier was used to scale the DU data to the TIMS data to highlight the nearly identical spectral signature The TIMS spectrum on Figure 6 comprised the co-added spectral rows number 256 and 257 as measured down from panel a 226 set up for viewing the directly sunlit diffuser panel b 226 set up for viewing the black body panel c 226 mechanized zero \(dark level calibration aperture cap in open position  Figure 5 \226 measurement set ups at DU

The radiometric calibration is applied by multiplying the flat fielded image of solar atmospheric absorption S FF DS-S\/\(DB-B\y the 225\260C black body radiance function \(see discussion above of panel d on Figure 4\.  This version of TIMS had a filter \(F1\ in the collimated region of the input optics group and another \(F2\n the structure in the TIMS data is thought to be due to channeling in F1. It was eliminated following the DU campaign by removal of F1  In addition to radiance validation the DU retrievals of CO and H2O, AIRS retrievals of CO, and ECMWF were also used for TIMS retrieval validation as discussed in reference   Relative contributions of CO, CH 4 and H 2 O to spectrum in the 2.33 \265m region\227 Experts in the field are well aware of these relative contributions but we review this here for the broader community.

It was deployed in 29 September in cloud free and near zero aerosol \(visibility > 30 miles\nditions. Species \(CO, CH 4  and H 2 O\retrievals from multiple frames with highly varying albedos but through a common atmospheric path showed that 200  Variation in albedo has no degrading consequence  for species retrieval since  the albedo itself can be retrieved with very high precision and that 200  Retrieved species precisions were very similar to those determined from the data obtained in the 2008 DU campaign ee Kum e r et al. [7  As mentioned in Section 1 the 2008 DU date are best suited for validation of the TIMS noise model that is presented in Section 5. The much more intensive validation support for the DU 2008 data are a major part of the reason for this However, the noise characteristics of these \(airship\e very consistent with those of the DU 2008 data Upgrade by installation of corrected collimating lens Back ground 226 A manufacturing error in the collimating lens  became apparent at a stage in the IIP program at which a remanufacture would set the program off schedule for months should it be implemented. Analysis showed that it would not detract from the message of our demonstration if we were to, on taking the proper precautions, install the less than perfect lens in to the TIMS. That message being, that the TIMS performance would demonstrate retrieval precision that would satisfy the GEO-CAPE operations requirements Figure 6 \226 Comparison of TIMS data and DU shortened stroke FTS data   Figure 7 \226 Contributions of CO, CH4 and H2O to th e spectrum in the TIMS 2.33 \265m spectral region  200 300 400 500 4280 4285 4290 4295 4300 radiance nW/\(cm 2 sr cm 1  wave number cm 1  Comparison of TIMS vs DU FTS data TIMS DU FTS 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 4270 4290 4310 scale for \(all-CO\ all scale for all  & for \(all-CO all species all CO all-CO\ -all Panel a 0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 4270 4290 4310 scale for \(all-CH4\ all all species all CH4 all-CH4\ all scale for all & for all-CH4 Panel b 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 4270 4290 4310 all species all H2O all-H2O\ll Panel c scale for all & for all-H2O scale for \(all-H2O\-all

  7 CO, CH 4 and H 2 O columns, respectively. The multiplier of the dispersion per pixel that achieved a best fit was 4.82 The multiplier for the albedo was 1.0047 Data characteristics 226 As seen by the well registered spectra in Figure 4 and Figure 10, the smiling features in the image present no problem for spectral registration. However, to the time in the program when these spectra \(Figures 4 and 10 and also those shown in referen  w e re reg i s t ered, it was a very tedious process. We are now well on the way to an automated process for spectrally registering all the rows of an image but this was not available at the time that the work reported here was implemented. Instead a laborious one spectrum  at a time method, that used gas cell data, and comparison of features in the TIMS atmospheric data set with those in the modeled spectrum was used to get a best registration. The data shown in Figures 4 and 10 were from two co-added adjacent spectral rows marked by the dashed yellow lines on the respective spectral images shown in Figure 9 The data in Figure 10 have relatively deep absorption lines That is because these were obtained with a low solar elevation of 73.73\260 and therefore through a long path of about 3.57 atmospheres. This corresponds to a geostationary observation with both the solar zenith angle to the footprint and the elevation angle of the LOS to the sensor  = 58.04\260 A close look shows some artifacts that are caused  by the use of slightly mismatching black body data for the flat fielding process. The mismatch was caused by use of a slightly differently focused instrument configuration for the black body data from that used for the solar data. Near the bottom wire the image is shifted slightly upwards on the focal plane in the black body data relative to the solar data. Thus the wire shadows in DB-D with nearly very near zero values are being divided into off wire out of shadow solar values DSD. This manifests itself in the narrow white \221ghost shadows\222 seen just above the two lower dark wire shadows in the DSD. This effect will not be present in space applications as care will be taken to utilize the same instrument configuration for calibration and scene data The same phenomenon associated with irregularity in the slit width can be seen in several other places if one looks hard enough. Most notably about 100 rows down from the top of the image \(about 50 rows down from the top wire  Again this would not be seen if the instrument configurations were identical for both the DS-D and the DBD data. These effects are serendipitously useful as they simulate highly structured albedo in the spatial case and emphasize that the spectra are not impacted by the effect in such a case. Retrieval depends only on the relative strength of spectral lines within the spectra, independent of albedo that is a simple multiplier, therefore it is not impacted These effects are not present in the DU data seen in the upper panel as care was taken in that case to assure that the configuration of the instrument, and therefore its spatial focus, was identical for the solar viewing, and the black body viewing, data. The DU campaign will be discussed in detail in Section 5 below Faint horizontal strips that are artifacts due to using a slightly defocused image DB so that the shadows of the wires on the slit would not have the strange zero/zero look of those in the top panel. These are due to irregularities in the slit width and if a spatially focus were to be used as was the case in the upper panel the change in light going through the slit in the DS and DB would cancel out and give the look of the upper panel. A more sophisticated equivalent of focused DB would be used for flat fielding and radiometric calibration in a space application TIMS vs a space application; data processing software 226 With TIMS we use thin wires on the slit to characterize spatial resolution \(slit to focal plane\d wedge \(or keystone\he observations of these enable characterization of spatial resolution and enable soft ware correction of wedge. We also have serendipitously learned that irregularity in the slit width is an excellent means to provide the same function as do the wires In a space application there is also a need for on orbit measurements to track potential changes in spatial resolution and in wedge. For the geostationary application we describe in Section 6 we have done a study that finds that there are about 8 or more stars available per day that are bright enough in the bands of interest to be used to acquire the measurements necessary for this purpose. These stars located near the ecliptic drif t through the earth centered geostationary filed of regard once per day. The measurements are acquired just off each limb of the earth first just before they drift behind the earth, and second when they drift out from behind the earth.   Each star would be imaged at several positions along the slit both times. Wedge and spatial resolution would be apparent in the spectral image of the star acquired on each of these occasions. A field of regard the order \261 10\260EW is more than sufficient from geostationary the earth subtends 17.4\260\o provide about 30s for each of these 8 daily measurements The improvements demonstrated here strengthen the case for a space application such as GEO-CAPE \(as was made in references d [7 o r a s  w i ll be m a de in S ect ion 6 below for a related four channel space application Figure 11 \226 Spectral resolution full width half maximum plotted vs  0.13 0.18 0.23 0.28 4269 4284 4299 4314 cm 1  cm 1  vs 


  8 Demonstration of FPA cooling by the LM ATC Pulse Tube Cryocooler \(PTC The purpose was to show that sufficient cooling could be achieved and that the operation of the PTC would not add noise to the system. The cold head and compressor of the LMATC PTC developed under contract to ESA for the INTEGRAL program is shown in Figure 12  To implement the study the dewar \(see Figures 3 and 5 above\was disassembled. The cold plate and LN2 reservoir were removed. A new dewar bottom plate was built for mounting the cryocooler.  The cryocooler was thermally coupled to a new instrument cold plate. The FPA was mounted to the new cold plate. All interface wiring was restrung. An opaque disc was placed on the cold filter mount \(see Figure 2\e off the view from the FPA to photons entering the dewar from the through the dewar window Noise data were obtained with the cooler turned on, and with it turned off.  There was no significant difference in the noise. This is an important result for space based applications in that PTCs will be used for these          Figure - 12 The LMATC ESA PTC cold head \(left\d compressor \(right  


  9 4  T HE 2.3  TIMS NOISE MODEL  Given the instrument parameters as will be defined below modeling the noise is common knowledge within the instrument community.  In this Section and in Section 5 below, for the more general community, we review the noise modeling process in the TIMS context. This will involve some symbols and equations, most are defined below in Table 1  For the signal radiance  R sig  the quantity  the number of photons absorbed per pixel per integration time is   P A/P R sig A D  1/hc  INT    and we define the radiance to photons conversion factor   to simplify     1 The shot noise in photons absorbed per pixel per integration time   due to the number of signal photons absorbed by the detector follows from equation \(1\d is given by         And in radiance units the absorbed signal photon shot noise is           2 and this defines the parameter R 1 1/F R P T SYS such that  such that R sig sqrt\(R 1 R sig portant for the TIMS noise analysis is the shot noise  that is due to instrument emitted thermal photons that are absorbed by the detector Other less important noise sources include the read noise  digitizer noise and dark current noise  The total noise  is given by         3 To further develop the unimportance of read, digitized and dark current noise for TIMS: to test the effects of these alone an opaque disc was placed on the cold filter mount see Figure 2\ to close off the FPA view of room temperature  photons entering through the dewar window. In this case only the read, digitizer and dark current contributed to the observed noise which was the order 6 to 8 equivalent counts.  This only a very small contribution to the noise observed in the DU 2008 campaign data that we discuss below in Section 5  5  A PPLICATION OF THE MODEL FOR ANALYSIS OF  THE 2008 DU CAMPAIGN TIMS DATA  As discussed in Sections 1 and 3 the data obtained in the DU campaign on the morning of 30 May 2008 are the best available for validation of the noise model developed above These data consist of a comprehensive set of darks \(D dark+black body \(DB\d dark+solar diffuser \(DS\a as needed to produce calibrated and flat fielded images of solar absorption spectra, and result by far from the best planned operations and documented data that we have available.

That light when dispersed is so weak that it effectively produces zero signal The measured dark counts \(darks\e to the much stronger signal of photons from the room temperature spectrometer cavity thermal that go through the relatively broad band pass of the cooled order sorting filter and on to the FPA. We know this from preliminary data obtained in our first DU campaign in 2007. The darks were so large that they caused saturation effects that confounded our attempts to obtain reasonable data. We ascertained this was because the darks were due to the mechanism as described above We mitigated this problem by adding appropriate stops to the dewar window and the on to the cold shielded within the dewar as presented in Appendix A. These were designed to suppress the darks while causing no vignetting of the scene images. This solved the problem so that we were able to get useful data in the next campaign, DU 2008 Since 2.33 \265m is on the very short wave side of the room temperature black body peak the darks are very sensitive to small changes in spectrometer temperature. For example in the average temperature in the ATC lab in the days just prior to the campaign was 72.26\260F and the mean value of the darks averaged 7400 counts; and during the campaign the average temperature of the DU lab was  75.81\260F and the averages of the darks 8500 counts. The ratio 7400/8500 BBF\(72.26\260F, 4291 cm 1 BF\(75.81\260F 4291 cm 1 where BF is the black body function of temperature and wave number. The darks scaled like the ratio of the of black body function for the two differing lab temperatures Another good example of this sensitivity is shown in Figure 13 where the weighted average of the spectrometer components temperature changed from 84.04  to 88.45 \260F over the 74 minute duration of the 2010 airship mission Specifically, the temperature scale is the weighted average temperature T AVG of the two spectrometer components measured temperatures, the Littrow mirror mount T L and the collimating relay lens mount T RL Then T AVG aT RL 1a L The value a = 0.63 provides the best fit of the model and data The points made are \(1\at   the dark background is most likely due to the black body radiation entering the dewar from the spectrometer, and \(2\at this is very sensitive to small changes in spectrometer temperature   Data collection procedures To get good statistics we collected data in sets of 25 consecutive images.

  11 The second observation that will be modeled is the noise, or standard deviation of the average counts  and  that are plotted on Figure 15.  Note STDV DB are significantly larger on the large wave number side of the Figure where the black body signal is not vignetted Here we discuss how that model is calculated. Referring to Section 4 above N MB is given by     4 The unknowns in equation \(4\ are and   These can be can be determined from the data, first we address  Since the noise in the N D and the N DB are photon absorption shot noise, the 2 cases can be used to evaluate  The number of photon absorptions A D  required to produce the count N D is defined by the equation    5 And the associated noise is given by   sqrt\(A D   6 So if the points N D and N DB are plotted in one direction and the points  and  are plotted in the other, then  is given by the slope        7 which follows from          8 Following equation \(7\e data shown on Figures 14 and 15 were used to calculate the  from the TIMS measurements. Individual pixels were too noisy to use Instead the approach was to use averages of the     and  to compute an average  as below       9 To de-emphasize the vignetted data we used averages that were weighted by N B as defined by equation \(10    10 Applying to the 260\260C data \(Figures 14 and 15\ we got the following results Table 3.

The degradation in TIMS spectral resolution starting at about 4301cm-1 and on to larger is clear, compare to the feature near 4294.5 cm-1 for example The scatter, i.e. noise, in the TIMS data will be analyzed in more detail in the following paragraphs The observed noise for an is the standard deviation of the 25 calibrated spectra.

  14 for the data obtained in the DU campaign The result is that for a given value Cos \(SZA\he signal to noise ratio \(SNR\es improved and therefore so does the CO retrieval precision, linearly with the SNR. The following analysis shows that the improved TIMS in space as described above would achieve the same 8.6% CO retrieval with much smaller Cos\(SZA\ = 0.044 On Figure 20 we show the SNR DU for the DU campaign data plotted on the range 4280 to 4302 cm 1 for Cos \(SZA 0.38 and the SNR IT  for the improved TIMS on the entire range and for Cos \(SZA\ = 0.044.

A multi-channel space application and predicted SNR Introduction  Most useful space applications would require more than a single channel per instrument to maximize science return. In the GEO-CAPE mission for example the CO instrument requires two channels, near 2.33 and 4.68 \265m. If it is desired to retrieve O 3 there is a relatively weak O 3 band within the 4.68 channel. But the O 3 retrieval quality can be considerably enhanced by adding a 3rd channel near 9.6 265m. A 4th channel near 4.3 \265m would provide for even better retrieval by improving on the use of an a-priori climatological temperature model The TIMS design approach provides for expanding to a 4channel system. This is enabled by the two collimated regions in the optical train that can be used for dichroic beam splitting as is noted on Figure 8 The geoCARB concept A 4-channel concept that uses this TIMS design approach is shown on Figure 21. The concept is aimed at a geostationary measurement of the green house gases CO 2 and CH 4 and the source discriminator gas CO. It employs the O 2 A band near 0.76 \265m for surface pressure measurement; the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, respectively for CO 2 total column mixing ratio, and the CH 4 and CO bands in a region centered near  2.32 \265m region for total column mixing ratio of those gases  Note the difference in the input optics from the TIMS case Figure 8. The focal ratio  is fixed at about f/3 as in the TIMS case but the aperture diameter is  increased is by about a factor two in order to achieve the desired 2.7 km footprint on the earth at the sub satellite point when viewing from geostationary. The input optical group uses an upfront two mirror a-focal telescope to provide the collimated space for the pupil stop and the beam splitter to the long and short wave regions. The advantage of the reflective telescope is that it is achromatic over the relatively wide spectral region that includes the 4 channels. The two-color objective focusing groups that feed the long wave and short wave slits use an optics design approach that has been developed for the NIRCAM on The NASA JWST mission. The spectrometer designs from slit to FPAs are clones of the TIMS with similar slit, system focal ratios, focal lengths FPAs and optics layout. The details of the optics are  Figure \226 21 Four channel concept utilizing the TIMS design approach  P1016 2 Long wave side 2.065 m & 2.323 m Glare Stop Slit 0.76 1.61 2.06 2.3 m FPA EW Nadir Slit DBS Short wave side 0.76 m & 1.61 m filter 


  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar. The H1RG is the current generation of the HAWAII series and the TIMS FPA is first generation Comparison is given in table 6. The newer generation has improved pixel to pixel uniformity Table 6.

To achieve high SNR in low light conditions a 4.08s exposure \(or stare time is used. For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two. The resulting E/W scan rate is 2400 km per observing hour and facilitates mapping of  the gases CO 2 CH 4 and CO with 2.7 km sample spacing on continental size regions several times per day The optical design code, using actual tolerances as have been achieved in previous LM ATC space instrument builds predicts spatial resolutions per sample of 4.1 km NS and 5.4 km EW Per 4.08s stare time twelve consecutive spectral images or frames, with 340 ms integration times are acquired and coadded per pixel to a 1024  x 1024 buffer array. The coadded buffer comprises the spectral image that is reported to telemetry.  Correlated double sampling \(CDS\used per each of the 12 frames. In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively. This measurement set is capable of providing break through reduction of uncertainty and attribution for the sources of CO 2 CH 4 and CO within the large geostationary field of regard of the geoCARB References 1  J.
