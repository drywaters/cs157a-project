Optimal Self-Healing of Service-Oriented Systems with Incomplete Information 
Self-healing management of services aims to discover diagnose and react to disruptions as well as maintain the Quality of Service QoS at a desired level for a running serviceoriented system Existing approaches assume that the state 
Abstract 
of a running service-oriented system can be fully monitored However the dynamic nature of the Internet environment coupled with the opaque internal status of third-party services makes such an assumption no longer hold In this paper we address the self-healing issue in service-oriented systems via a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process POMDP We determine the best action to minimize the operation cost caused by the QoS failure of particular component services by computing the optimal value of the POMDP By relying on such a exible technology we are able to deal with the difìculties arising from the unpredictability of external partner services 
and the opaqueness of their internal status We conduct a simulation to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach

re-organized when the overall Quality of Service QoS of a running service-oriented system cannot meet the user requirements As a result self-healing and maintenance optimization in service-oriented systems have been gaining increasing attention given the highly dynamic Web environment as well as the autonomous and fast-changing nature of Web services In particular  maintenance optimization is leveraged to identify the optimal self-healing strategy that determines what healing actions to perform and in what status of the system so that the cost of failing to meet the QoS requirements can be minimized while ensuring the proper functioning of the system There are several approaches that have been develope 
d to achieve self-healing service-oriented systems Some approaches implement self-healing after the detection of failures When an error occurs it stops currently running   and repairs or replaces the malfunctioned ones A major issue with these reactive approaches is that they cause long disruptions of currently running service systems which in most cases will incur high revenue cost or risk to lose a large number of customers To address this issue Markov Decision Processes MDPs have been employed to achieve proactive self-healing strate Despite effectively addressing the dynamics of the serviceoriented systems and easy to implement and solve MDPs 
assume full and precise knowledge on the state of component Web services Unfortunately such an assumption no longer holds for most service-oriented systems as the system owner can only observe the communication with the third-party services and has no access to their internal status or variables For instance the system owner cannot know a priori the list of items available from an online sale service Ev en with some adv anced inspection technologies that allow to monitor the internal state of thirdparty services some QoS parameters such as the response time and reliability are inherently uncertain and hence cannot be observed precisely These parameters may be inîuenced 
by the unstable communication links or the performance of other services that the system depends on To address the central challenges as outlined above we explicitly take into account the non-observability of component services internal states as well as the unpredictability of their QoS behaviors We propose to exploit Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes POMDPs to extend the standard MDPs which allows us to develop self-healing strategies for service-oriented systems not just based the observed states of third-party services In particular POMDPs work with that are represented by probability

distributions over all states including both observed and unobserved ones 11 W e deri v e some k e y properties of the optimal value function used by a POMDP which leads to the optimal maintenance and quality control policy that minimizes the expected total discounted system cost By relying on such a exible technology we are able to deal with the difìculties that arise from the unpredictability of external partner services the opaqueness of their internal status and the measure errors of the service monitoring mechanisms

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 reports some related work Section 3 introduces a motivating scenario which will be used throughout the paper Section 4 gives a brief background overview on MDP and POMDP Section 5 presents the self maintenance model where key decision variables are only partially observable Section 6 shows the simulation study and reports the results Section 7 concludes the paper II R ELATED W ORK In this section we brieîy describe several existing approaches that contribute to the self-healing issue in serviceoriented systems In the context of autonomic computing an autonomic manager is needed to monitor and collect information from the system Ongoing research in the eld of monitoring services in open-world scenarios has taken a number of diverse directions The work in can be re garded as a requirement analysis approach to addressing the monitoring problem Speciìcally to address the problem of web service monitoring it integrates requirement analysis and software execution monitoring Requirement analysis helps derive goals and obstacles of monitoring where the latter specify situations that prevent the system from reaching the former Ghezzi et al investigate how to monitor dynamic service compositions with respect to contracts expressed via assertions on services Dynamic compositions are represented as BPEL processes which can be monitored at run-time to check whether individual services comply with their contracts Monitors can be automatically deìned as additional services and linked to the service composition They present two alternative implementations for the monitoring approach one based on late-binding and reîection and the other based on a standard assertion system Baresi et al propose Defensive Process Design DPD and Service run-time Monitoring SrtM DPD consists of designing the serviceoriented business process so as to permit it to cope with erroneous behaviors SrtM consists of using an external monitor service capable of checking whether functional and/or non-functional contracts are violated Gurguis presents a mechanism to recover from failure based on XML-based correlating reported logs which focuses on reactive selfhealing mechanisms Casati et al develop a system called eFlow to support speciìcation enactment and management of composite eServices In eFlo w  service processes can adapt to environment changes with minimal or no user intervention It is also possible to dynamically modify the process deìnition with user intervention eFlow is enacted by a centralized process engine However eFlow does not have the rules for automatically switching services when failures occur The reconìguration process deìnition modiìcation requires user intervention which is not efìcient since all process instances must be stopped and wait for the reconìguration to complete Finally no QoS issues are considered in eFlow Yu et al develop two algorithms to solve the service failures and the overloaded problem The rst algorithm generates for each service along the optimal path a secondary path from current service to the end of the business process During runtime a business process component service can automatically switch to the secondary path whenever its successor becomes unavailable The second algorithm uses a replacement path approach to reconstruct a new process by skipping a failed service Eto et al model a dynamic software system as a semiMarkov decision process and derive optimal software rejuvenation policies that minimize the expected cost when failures occur Dynamic programming is e xploited to achieve the optimal policy They also assume that the state of software system deteriorates stochastically Sandhya et al present a proacti v e self-healing approach to decide when to replace a currently running service before the service fails Their approach is based on the well-known Markov Decision Process MDP useful for studying a wide range of optimization problems via dynamic programming and reinforcement learning A partially observed Markov decision process POMDP has been used in to model service adaptation and service re-selection as a sequential decision problem In this approach services that would bring the maximum expected long-term beneìt will be selected and substituted into the current instance during adaptation POMDP is employed to take full advantage of preferential policies for selecting substitutable services which has a completely different purpose as in our approach III A M OTIVATING S CENARIO We describe a motivating example in this section that will be used throughout the paper to illustrate the key challenges that may arise in service-oriented systems and the solutions we propose to cope with them Suppose that a client wants to make a travel plan through a service-oriented system e.g priceline.com and typical services may include ight query service ticket reservation service hotel booking service and car rental service We consider a simple scenario that just consists of two services ight query and ight reservation The ight reservation service accepts the order form verify the user identity prepare the bill and nalize the purchase order request Before making the nal purchase order the reservation service needs to invoke the ight query service to get the

004 A Markov Decision Process MDP is a model for solving sequential stochastic decision problems Speciìcally an MDP is deìned by a tuple  where is the set of the states of the world is a set of actions an agent can use is a reward function that for each state and action assigns a numeric reward or cost if the value is negative is a function that for each state and action associates a probability distribution over the possible successor denotes the set of all probability distributions over  states.Thus for each  and the function determines the probability of a transition from state to state after executing action  i.e A solution to an MDP is a policy that deìnes which actions should be executed in each state Various exact and approximate algorithms exist for computing an optimal policy and the best known are policyiteration and value-iteration Solving MDPs is known to be a polynomial problem in the number of states and therefore exponential in the number of state variables A value function assigns for each state a value the expected utility from acting optimally beginning in and on to inìnity Value iteration computes an optimal value function by iteratively solving the equation 1 for all and  and is the step iterative value of state  A well known extension to the MDP model is the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process POMDP model A POMDP is a tuple  where deìnes an MDP is a set of possible observations is the probability of executing action  reaching state and observing  The observation can only partially capture the true state of the core process There is a probabilistic relationship between the true state of the core process and the observation at time  Speciìcally the probabilistic relationship is

Figure 1 Running Example ight information In Fig 1 we illustrate our motivating scenario graphically and we model the ight query service as a provider service and the ight reservation service as a consumer service As service-oriented applications are distributed systems services are usually composed by means of brokers Brokers help clients discover and select available candidate services based on their quality requirements The simple scenario as given in Fig 1 helps illustrate many typical faulty situations that may arise in a distributed application For example the ight query service may take a very long time to respond thereby delay the overall performance Assume that the required response time has an upper limit as 1 second Hence if the response time of light query service goes beyond 1 second it causes a QoS failure In this case we may decide to replace the service when it does not meet the required QoS criteria such as response time In a dynamic Internet environment the quantity that represents the system state usually cannot be measured directly and accurately The output of inspection on a certain service can vary for different Internet conditions These factors can make the inspection unreliable and result in uncertainties of the output Furthermore uncertainties also exist in the interpretation of the output of inspection So replacing the service at each QoS failure is not a beneìcial action as it may not be a true failure caused by the service itself Hence a systematic approach is in need to decide when to go for replacement of potentially problematic services in a serviceoriented system IV P RELIMINARIES In this section we brieîy describe the Markov decision process and partially observable Markov decision process that will lay out a technical background for the proposed approach

consumerês expectations are met and these expectations are captured by a utility function The consumer service has an expected QoS which it demands when invoking with a provider After a service is invoked the consumer compares the expected QoS with the QoS actually received If the received QoS surpasses the expected QoS the consumer is satisìed and unsatisìed if otherwise A provider that consistently fulìlls its role and satisìes the consumer will attain a high reputation The QoS of a web service may change with time due to dynamic Internet environment The state of a serviceoriented system has to be inspected and repaired if necessary from time to time to maintain the desired QoS level If some services consistently fail to meet the desired QoS criteria they have to be replaced to ensure the performance of the entire system But replacing an existing service with a new one typically incur higher cost that may disrupt the operation of the system Hence we aim to choose an optimal maintenance strategy The state evolution of a service-oriented system is inherently a stochastic process as operation environment of component web services is highly dynamic Hence we cannot fully understand all the changes in the environment in an timely fashion Therefore we propose to model the maintenance decision making problem as a partially observable Markov decision process POMDP which places a belief distribution over the possible states and uses observations to adjust this belief Instead of knowing exactly what the current state is POMDP has a belief about the current state represented by the function that assigns a probability to every possible state In our model the state of a service represents the actual reputation of the service and is only partially observable through some inspection approach In this regard an adaptation broker should use the partially observable environment states historical adaptation processes and the potential beneìt to make current adaptation decisions The way how different components of the POMDP interact is illustrated in Fig 2 The agent is unable to identify the current state and is therefore forced to estimate the current state given the current observations and then executing action receiving a reward reaching the next state The POMDP based model is deìned as  where denotes the QoS state of a Web service denotes the maintenance actions denotes the revenue function denotes the state transition function and denote the observable information and function respectively In what follows we describe each of the key components of the model in detail Our model aims to decide whether continuing to use an existing provider service or replacing it based on the expected incurred loss The consumer service keeps track of the QoS intimation of QoS failure by the provider if any Hence our state space is based on the loss incurred to the consumer As a result we deìne the state of the consumer as follows Let be the QoS of the provider service at time  which is a random variable because of the randomness of the running processes and uncertainty of maintenance effects The state of a component service at time depends not only on its QoS at that time but also the required QoS criterion  which is typically a constant If the R\(t is superior to S\(t then we say that the provider service is in the state of good otherwise in bad state It is in the failed state if the service failed In real engineering applications we may use a more precise classiìcation e.g very bad bad good and very good The erroneous behaviors of Web services are mostly unforeseeable at design-time For this reason the solutions presented here rely heavily on special-purpose recovery actions Service run-time monitoring consists of checking whether functional and/or nonfunctional requirements are violated Once a fault is notiìed several different kinds of actions can be triggered in the attempt to reach the goals of the process regardless of the errors We identify three maintenance actions to tackle typical faulty behaviors that can arise in service-oriented system  This action simply keeps using the provider service regardless the violation of the QoS requirement  is to re-invoke a faulty external service is retried to verify whether the fault is transient

 is to dynamically bind to another service A dynamic binding occurs which replaces an existing faulty service with a better one to guarantee the same functional and/or non-functional properties The resultant effect of a maintenance action can be described by the probability that the action upgrades the provider service from state before the maintenance to state after the action Let represent the maintenance action taken at time   where is the maintenance action space and be the probability that action change the provider service from state at time t to state j then we deìne the effect of a maintenance action 6 is the revenue function which may take a negative value for a negative reward In our model it is always negative because for each action a cost is paid regardless of the state For example we assign 1 cost for the continue action 5 for retry action and 10 for rebind action However for transitions to a satisìed state i.e from bad to good no penalty is applied whereas transitions to an unsatisìed state yield a large penalty is the state transition function which captures the probability that the system will enter the state from under the action  denoted by  For example when the provider service is in bad state and we use the rebind action to switch to another service which leads the system to a good state with probability 0.9 We can summarize it as  is the set of observable information received by the monitor which denotes the QoS information of the provider service is the observation function which is used to compute the possible observed value at the state after adopting action presented by  To achieve accurate evaluation on the condition of a service and make satisfactory maintenance decisions the prior knowledge must be updated by incorporating new information which better reîects the actual status the service When monitoring a service the of the service is maintained which calculates the probability distribution over states via Bayes rule That is when speciìes the probability of for all  we can derive an updated belief after taking some action and receiving an observation with probability  Assuming discrete sets of states and observations this update can be formulated as 7 where is a normalizing constant with  These beliefs are the basis for decision making because a policy maps beliefs to actions  We can specify the observation function to account for how the monitored QoS information changes our belief about the actual reputations of a provider service Furthermore we can specify the transition function that maps actions in prior states to next state Using both the transition and observation functions the POMDP provides a principled framework to nd the best action based upon the current belief A POMDP provides a principled and expressive framework for self-healing modeling However calculating optimal policies for a POMDP is nontrivial An exact solution can be computed using the belief state MDP which is an MDP over the belief space of the POMDP The policy maps a belief state space into the action space The optimal policy can be understood as the solution of a continuous space Markov Decision It is deìned as a tuple where  is the set of belief states over the POMDP states  is the same nite set of action as for the original POMDP  is the belief state transition function  is the reward function on belief states It writes  Therefore value iteration which is a standard method of nding the optimal policy in MDP can also be used to calculate optimal inìnite horizon POMDP policies The difference between the optimal value function and the optimal horizon value function goes to zero as goes to inìnity 8 It turns out that the optimal value function can be calculated in a nite number of steps given the Bellman error  which is the maximum difference between two successive nite horizon value functions The value iteration algorithm for POMDPs can be summarized in Algorithm 1 The Value Iteration for Solving POMDP  for all  calculate for all states  increment The previous equation can be rewritten in terms of the original POMDP formulation as 9

where 10 Note that by capturing the action that maximizes the right-hand-side of Bellmanês equation we indirectly obtain a policy While Bellmanês equation gives us a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used in theory to nd optimal policies in practice the continuous belief space is problematic since it is not possible to apply Bellmanês equation to an inìnite number of belief points Fortunately as pointed out by Smallwood and Sondik optimal v alue functions are piecewise-linear and convex which can be exploited to apply Bellmanês equation in a nite number of times once per linear piece of the value function As an alternative approximate solutions can be efìciently computed using the point-based value iteration algorithm  VI E VALUATION As there is no publicly available real-world datasets that can be used for evaluation purposes we conduct a simulation study to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach All the experiments are implemented in Java and carried out on a Windows 2003 Server with an Intel Xeon E7320 2.13GHZ CPU and 8GB RAM Let us consider the example discussed in section 3 Assume that the performance of the consumer service is described using four states 1 good 2 medium 3 bad and 4 failed The self-evolution process is modeled by a stationary Markov chain with state space  The transition matrix is given by 11 A monitoring service is used to measure the QoS of the provider service and evaluate which state the system is in Therefore the monitor service may yield the same number of outcomes as that of the system states but errors exist in the measurement results The relationship matrices is 12 The rows and columns of matrix correspond to the true states of the process and the outcome of monitor and is the probability that the monitor outcome will be if the true state is  For example means that the monitor outcome could be system being in state 3 with probability 0.1 if the true state of the system is 2 13 14 15 The maintenance cost matrix is deìned as 16 This problem is modeled as a POMDP model and the optimal maintenance policy can be found through the discussed approach Figure 3 shows the changed average cost per action execution over time It can be seen that the model works well in the partial observable environment The average cost does not uctuate drastically It can always avoid entering the failed state The time complexity of nding a best strategy based on this model is an exponential function and will increase with the number of steps  So if the state increases the computing time can not be ignored and the approximation technique needs to be adopted

Threshold observe that the number of frequent subgraphs rst increases exponentially and then increases smoothly after an inîection point emerges This is because frequent subgraphs with smaller size tend to have many extensions that are then able to be veriìed as frequent subgraphs as well Nevertheless frequent subgraphs with larger size may not have many valid extensions with respect to the frequency threshold The position of the inîection point relies on the frequency threshold Generally a small frequency threshold leads to a larger inîection point Another interesting nding is that the number of frequent subgraphs drops superlinearly when we enlarge the frequency threshold Not surprisingly the size of their posting lists shown in Figure 10\(b follows the same trends to that of the number of frequent subgraphs The running time and the I/O cost for both MRFSE-J and MRFSE-E follow the same trends When reducing the frequency threshold we can nd that the running time in MRFSE-J increases more signiìcantly than that in MRFSE-E while the I/O cost is the exact opposite VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we studied the problem of efìciently supporting frequent subgraphs extraction in a distributed environment particularly using the MapReduce framework We presented a framework called MRFSE to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs on a MapReduce like platform such as Hadoop We introduced a equal size partitioning strategy in order to balance the workload We proposed an isomorphismtesting-free approach for generating new subgraphs by properly maintaining how frequent subgraphs are mapped within each graph Extensive experiments conducted on our in-house clusters demonstrate that the techniques built using proposed framework are scalable and efìcient A

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
