A Behavioral Classifica tion of Investors in Shanghai Stock Market Huiyi Tan and H. J. Cai International School of Software Wuhan University, Wuhan, P. R. China tan6043@gmail.com  Abstract 227 In our study, we analyzed a securities clearing dataset from a Chinese brokerage firm, and classified investors based on their behavior. We calculate every account\222s market value, number of stocks and trading frequency, then reduce every account\222s stock portfolio to corresponding expected risk  and rate of  return. And we

Furthermore,  among the investors with the medium-account, more people tend to avert risk, and riskpreference investors are more inclined to change their holding stocks than risk-aversion ones 
 Keywords-clustering; investment behavior; data mining I   I NTRODUCTION  Many studies are conducted on securities trading data to discover the investors\222 trading behavior in China\222s A Share market. Wang & He[1 pl i e d d a t a  m i ni ng  technology to customer relationship management of securities industry and presents securities business model of CRM based on customer clustering methods. In class classification layer, they use hierarchical clustering model to realize customer classification according to such indexes 
as trading frequency, trading capacity and interest balance In the group classification layer, they adopted dynamic Bayes model in order to group customers, according to customers' operating style Wang & He[2 d i sc usse s t w o pa t t e r ns i n da t a m i ni ng  association rules and sequential patterns, and describes the process to find these patterns by mining historical securities trading database. Through the analysis of mining result, their study presents the concept and realization of customer behavior model, and successfully applies the model to advance the performance of Internet securities 
dealing system These research approaches ignore the essential characteristic of investors the purpose of purchasing stocks is to earn returns from securities trades. We introduce CAPM into the data preprocess, in this way, the stocks purchased are correlated, and are able to be denoted with the portfolio\222s excepted risk and rate of return, no matter the number of stocks an investor holds. The results are four distinct groups, from these groups, we know more about the investment behavior in Chinese Stock Market II  
 D ATA AND PRELIMINARY STATISTICS  In this study, we use a real clearing data from a Chinese brokerage firm, and all investment accounts in this data are open in Shanghai Exchange Securities clearing data contains rich information[3    covering all the security  types \227 stocks, funds, bonds options, and tremendous accounts information, including daily security alteration, security holdings, capital alteration, opening or closing accounts, as well as every transaction\222s stock name, quantity, market value and commission. Our study focuses on the Account Share 
Holdings\(ASH\ table, which records all account holders\222 every security purchasing and corresponding holdings There are 70594 accounts in ASH table, and we assume that each account represents an investor, which is the case mostly. By  calculating securities they have bought, securities valued, and times the investors traded during the month we observed, we collected three basic information about each account account\222s market value number of stocks, and trading frequency. We calculate the preliminary statistics using SPSS, and the result is shown in Table I 
III  M ETHODOLOGY  A  CAPM based  portfolio transformation In our study, we pay more attention on clustering investors by the stocks  they bought. However, the numbers of stocks in every account are unequal. To solve this problem, we use the CAPM to correlate the stocks into a package, and use expected rate of return and excepted risk to describe them[4   Step 1: calculate the every stock\222s beta value using equation \(1 1

And all these characters are listed in Table I In order to calculate the distance between each case, we normalize the investors\222 attributes, account value, number of stocks, trading frequency, by the following steps Firstly, since every account\222s market value varies extremely, the maxim value is thousands of times of the minimum one. We transform the account value into their common logarithm value, ranging from only 3 to 11 which is apparently reasonable to calculate distance Secondly, we alter the number of stocks\(ns\nd reduce all the values into just 4 values 002

Initially, the data points are assigned randomly to the K sets. For step 1, the centroid is computed for each set. In step 2, every point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest to that point. These two steps are alternated until a stopping criterion is met i.e., when there is no further change in the assignment of the data points In this study, SPSS is employed as data mining tool for analysis[7  W e l e t S P SS t o ch o o s e  in iti al cen t e rs  randomly, and we set the ultimate iteration to 30, and set the k =4, which means it will generate 4 clusters IV  R ESULTS  From the statistics of each group, we find that the final four clusters are distinctly remarkable.

While medium accounts \(cluster 1 & 2\ are between the big and small ones. The numbers of stocks in each account reflects the investors\222 investment style.

Investors in cluster 2 are excepted to earn more than the other three In both Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, a huge gap appears between risk-aversion and risk-preference investors with medium accounts, an it implies that customers in cluster 1 and cluster 2 are totally different on their investment attitudes V  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we apply a new approach to the real securities clearing data from a Chinese brokerage firm. We convert every portfolio into its corresponding excepted risk and rate of return, then using k-means clustering algorithm classify them according to their account value, number of stocks, trading frequency and portfolios. Four distinct groups are found: small-account  investors, big-account investors, medium-account with risk-aversion investors and medium-account with risk-preference investors Small account investors prefer risks a little more than those with scale capital. The big-account investors, like the institutional investors, can make profits from their large amounts of capital, and they are under supervision of departments concerned to avert risks. Investors with smallaccount are less aware of risk aversion for lacking of finance and investment knowledge Among medium-account investors, the number of riskpreference people is  64% more than that of risk-aversion ones. Furthermore, the former ones are more inclined to change their holding stocks than the latter. The reason is that the former ones prefer short swing trading A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  The authors  wish to acknowledge  Mingli Wang and Annie Wang for many useful discussions during this study   R EFERENCES  1  Z.

implementation of this clustering algorithm will not suffe r the same speed limitations of software Hardware maps the clustering algorithm onto an FPGA that allows for signicant parallelism The results of the packet loss at the gateway no de are presented in Figure 11 The number of packets that are unable to be clustered varies from 27,000 to 209,000 packets  Figure 9 illustrates the amount of trafc in and out of the gat eway node The average packet size received at the gateway is 217 bytes Each node generates 9,090 packets In the 75 node example 9090 x 75  681,750 packets are destined for the GW node The GW was only able to receive 434,995 packets and the others were dropped due to an overloaded CPU The total trafc received at the GW was 217  434,995  94,393,915 bytes or approximately 94 Mbytes Figure 6 depicts the amount of trafc generated in the network as the number of nodes increased from 10 to 75 From this gure the JXTA P2P Multicast protocol is the most expensive implementation to distribute trafc to all nodes U sing either IP Multicast or Ethernet Broadcast is signicant ly less expensive From these results the IP Multicast protocol was selected as the protocol to deploy in the software and hardware clustering applications These simulations help ed to demonstrate the problems of deploying the JXTA P2P at the Gateway Cluster Node This protocol would create additional CPU and network load to further degrade the performance of the clustering From Figure 6 the overhead associated with sending the same information using JXTA Multicast required 17 times the total bandwidth This overhead comes from the additional complexity of pushing multicast state information encapsulated with each message using overlays to the application layer Thus it is possible to predict 138,087,788  17  2,347,492,396 bytes or approximately 2.3 Gigabytes of trafc destined for the gateway node if P2P multicast is chosen as the distribution method The GW node would be able to process signicantly less if conventional hardware is used Testing conrms that even a 3 Ghz CPU could not keep up with receiving and clustering of the smaller multicast packets which necessitates the use of FPGA or ASIC technology 7 H ARDWARE A RCHITECTURE Advanced SA requires the use of high speed networks with increased bandwidth to implement centralized track fusion to improve tracking performance Distributed track fusion ca n process the data locally and only exchange key observations to improve SA It is critical to select the correct distance a nd clustering methods to ensure the right data arrives at the ri ght time to the distributed nodes Manhattan distance is used to calculate the distance to the projected target position or centroid This coarse gating  technique is responsible for the majority of the data reduct ion Track prediction is critical to setting the clustering thre shold Selecting the tracks to be clustered is a form of track-t otrack

D ESIGN The track clustering algorithm performs four primary opera tions 1 calculating the distances between observations a nd centroids 2 identifying if the incoming observation map s to an existing centroid 3 updating the centroid or creating a new cluster and 4 determining if the track should be dropped or sent based on the timetable The hardware implementation is comprised of three primary modules Track Cluster Time Compare and Update In addition to these modules control modules were needed to load and run the hardware clustering system Figure 13 shows the architectu re of the track clustering system Time Stamp As the track data enters the system it is provided with a time stamp The time compare module uses the 32-bit time stamp to determine if the track should dropped or sent based on the 8 


Update Control Processor Track Cluster Accept Time Compare Time Stamp Report Figure 13  Hardware Track Clustering Block Diagram dened update rates set by the time threshold Track Cluster A set of smaller modules comprise the track cluster function  The rst module calculates the distance and is designed in a modular fashion so that it can be replaced with diverse metrics implemented in hardware The Manhattan distance calculation is replicated in parallel to evaluate multiple dis tances simultaneously The second component is the cluster table The cluster table maintains a list of current clusters/tracks locally on the F PGA chip The centroids of the clusters represent the projected position of the track for prioritization This projected posi tion determines if an incoming track matches a cluster The calculated parallel distances are passed to the accept module t o make the critical decision to forward the data Accept The accept module compares all parallel distances to a clust er threshold If the distance is less than the cluster threshol d the module will assign the incoming track to the specied cluste r The module will not assign the incoming track if the distance s are greater than the cluster threshold If this occurs the s ystem currently decides the incoming track is a new cluster and will specify that a new entry needs to be added to the cluster table Update After the accept module determines if an assignment is accepted the update module then updates the cluster table Th e update is computed from the velocity information contained in the track data and determines the projected position of th e track The projected position is passed to the cluster table in the track cluster module for storage The accept module determines whether the track is a new track and needs to be added to the set of known clusters The update module will calculate the projection of the track and then send the infor mation to the cluster table to be stored Time Compare The time compare module determines if the track should be dropped or forwarded to downstream modules/systems The module is comprised of a timetable that maintains two time values the last time the cluster/track was reported and the last time a track message was received A time threshold determines if a track message should be sent or aggregated If the difference between the last sent time and the current time is greater than the threshold the data is sent from the node However if the difference is less than the time thresh old the data updates the cluster table however the data is not sent from the node The timetable also contains information regarding the velo city and the accuracy of the incoming track data This data is used in conjunction with the time data to determine whether the system sends or drops the data The velocity information is used to determine the three time categories or priorities of trafc high medium and low 9 C LUSTERING O BSERVATION D ATA The track data is part of the network trafc owing to and from each clustering node Each track observation has a current position and velocity in the xy dimension The clusteri ng system can be expanded into a larger dimensional space although the dimensionality is set to two currently The clustering nodes are interconnected using a network where multiple sensors on different platforms report the sa me track information but may have different accuracies These tracks are similar representations of the same information  but are received at multiple clustering nodes at different t imes due to network traversal The clustering nodes maintain information on the current clusters active tracks and clust er centroids In addition to the position of the track the system uses time stamps to determine the last time a cluster was reported The clustering system uses a modied algorithm similar to K-means In traditional K-means the number of clusters K is set to a specied number We allow the number of clusters to start from zero and expand as new tracks are found The algorithm utilizes two tables to achieve the desired fun ctionality The rst table the cluster table is comprised o f the current clusters that are projections of where the track sho uld be in the next track message As tracks are received they are compared to the clusters using the Manhattan distance If th e distance is less than a threshold cluster threshold the t rack message is assigned to the specied cluster The velocity of the track message updates the projection of the cluster Thi s projection update allows the system to account for tracks th at are not static If the distance from the input track is greate r than the threshold for all the current clusters a new cluste r is added The second table the track time table maintains two times for each cluster the last time a message was sent about that cluster and the last time a message was received about that cluster Since the track data is time stamped when the clus9 


tering system receives the track the system compares the ti me received to the time sent If this time is greater than the tim ing threshold the system will allow the message to pass and update the cluster received time in the table However if th e time is less than the time threshold the system updates the cluster received time and removes the message from the outgoing trafc 10 H ARDWARE F ABRICATION The implementation on the NetFPGA platform was able achieve a clock frequency of 125 MHz The hardware utilization of a track clustering algorithm with four parallel distance metrics is shown in Table 1 With a slice utilization of 44 the number of distance metrics can be increased This increase in parallel distance calculation reduces the late ncy to compare incoming tracks to all known clusters XC2VP50 Utilization Resources Utilization Percentage Slices 10533 out of 23616 44 4-input LUTS 14318 out of 47232 30 Flip Flops 12958 out of 47232 27 Block RAMs 82 out of 232 35 External IOBs 353 out of 692 51 Table 1  Device utilization for XC2VP50 Hardware Track Clustering with four concepts Given our implementation with four parallel distance metri cs with 100 total tracks in the cluster table at any one time we can estimate the total time for clustering an incoming track  The parallel distances can be calculated in four cycles The total number of cycles required to produce all 100 distances would be 100 Since the operation of the clustering circuits are pipelined the accept module would only require three cy cles for determining the correct action to perform The upda te module would require three cycles to perform an update or creation of a new cluster The time table compare takes three cycles Add in an additional four cycles for header processing and we have a total of 113 cycles Since we are running the hardware at 125 Mhz the total time required for distance calculations assignment determination and updates requ ires 0.904  s for each incoming track This gives us an approximate throughput of 1.1 million packets per second 11 C ONCLUSIONS The results show that the real time hardware using the Kmean algorithm for clustering can accurately locate redundant track data for aggregation identify new tracks and se lect the critical tracks to be forwarded to other distributed sen sor nodes for fusing Improvements in the information quality and latency for distributed track fusion were demonstrated using advanced clustering Track data distributed using multicast is shown to generate 2.3 Gigabytes of trafc for large scale 75 nodes fusion Experiments revealed state-of-the-art CPUs could not handle bursts of packets received which resulted in loss of pack ets due to network buffer overow The clustering gateway node was shown to provide an 18 to 48x reduction in bandwidth through eliminating redundant data The results were tested in a distributed environment called Emulab that used a software version of the clustering algorithms State-oftheart Emulab CPUs could not keep up with the track data resulting in network buffer overow and loss of packets This illustrates the need for our special processing solution us ing FPGA technology Real time clustering is implemented in the network layer OS I layer 3 to reduce the bandwidth intelligently while mainta ining high information content Our pipelined hardware desig n calculates four parallel distance metrics for 100 total tra cks in 100 cycles The total time required for distance calculations assignment determination and updates is only 0.904  s for each incoming track The hardware solution is prototyped using the Stanford NetFPGA in the Boeing Center for Intelligent Networked Systems CINS lab Our real time solution preserves Layer 7 resources and decreases latencies The ability to add real time hardware in t he network layer improves MTT performance in bandwidth limited environments ultimately preserving legacy avionic ne twork resources 12 F UTURE W ORK Novel methods to illustrate the increased value of information using clustering over normal queuing methods was constructed based on spatial methods Our use of clustering algorithms was fairly limited with K-means however there are plans to implement solutions based on N-means algorithms in the future We realize selection of the correct clusterin g thresholds must be dynamic based on the separation of target s and is highly dependent on accurately projecting the centro id The relationship between our temporal and spacial clusteri ng algorithms must be integrated into a single solution We pla n to develop dynamic clustering thresholds for more accurate prediction of target paths while selectively reducing the d istribution bandwidth Real time assessment of the information value allows us to dynamically adjust the thresholds fo r preserving the key observations We theorize that changing the update rates proportionally with the target velocity wi ll provide improved information value We also plan to add a weighting factor to take into account proximity sensor acc uracy and threat level will provide a more intelligent soluti on Interconnecting the time increment used in the projection o f the clustering centroid with the temporal target rate will s implify the algorithms and hardware Reliable transfer of data using wireless is available in sev eral avionic systems and will be evaluated as a separate test case Latency will denitely increase if all dropped packet s are transferred as required by reliable transport 10

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didn’t measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

Our current implementa tion does not support documents with “variable-le ngth arrays” – lists of identically structured elements with non-fixed lengths Otherwise identically structured documents with different array lengths are currently considered as having different structure We are currently working on supporting “variablelength arrays” to extend the applicability of Structure Encoding. We are also looking at provide similar, but less aggressive, optimization support for schemaconforming documents REFERENCES  Nokia Web Services – Helping Operators Mobilize the Internet Http://www.projectliberty.org/resources/whitepapers/W S_Operators_A4_0408.pdf  The SAX Project. http://www.saxproject.org  XML Pull Parsing. http://www.xmlpull.org  W3C Document Object Model http://www.w3.org/DOM  WAP Binary XML Content Format http://www.w3.org/TR/wbxml  Efficiency Structured XML. http://www.esxml.org  VTD-XML. http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net  XSLTC Documentation. http://xml.apache.org/xalanj/xsltc  kXML. http://www.kxml.org  Liefke, H. and D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
