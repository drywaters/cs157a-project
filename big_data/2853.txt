Abstract-In 
order to accelerate imaging process and lower overall system cost many practical CT systems use single slice detectors and big-pitch helical scanning especially in next generation Baggage Scanning system In this paper we present a reconstruction strategy for this kind of systems We researched on the imaging qualities resulting from different scanning parameters especially the thickness of the detectors The experimental study is both 
on simulation data and experimental data We found out that reconstruction results from relatively thicker detectors are better than those from thinner detectors We also compared post-processing methods of single dimensional smoothing and multi-dimensional smoothing in improving the imaging quality for such resulting reconstructions from single\255 slice-detector helical CT SSDHCT Finally an implementation scheme of the reconstruction algorithm and post-processing using the latest GPU is presented We achieve a 10 times speedup and the performance meets the requirement for practical applications At last we produced a sample machine using this technique and get some real baggage

INTRODUCTION 
Single Slice Detector Helical scanning GPU parallel CT reconstruction 
is a wonderful memory to China and the whole world A lot of people devoted much in this event We should also know that the success of the Olympic not only relies on the effort of athletes volunteers and organizers but also on the sound and safe environment guaranteed by the advanced security system The baggage scanning is used widely 
in nowadays security inspection especially since the last 10 years But recognition can't be done automatically on the overlapped image from a DR inspecting system CT type baggage scanning system becomes a good option To lower system cost and make the device compact some of the resent baggage CTs use single slice detectors With the limited thickness of detector slice and requirement of high throughput the pitch of such a helical CT is usually big The targeted advantage is clear lower price fewer data storage shorter scanning time and lower radiation dose 4 However the projection data is seriously incomplete usually 1/20th 
255 1/40th of the complete data acquired by traditional helical CT systems Therefore different from the traditional systems Manuscript received November 10 2008 This work was supported grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China No 10575059 No 60772051 and No 60871084 Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University NCET the Key Faculty Supporting Program of Tsinghua University Department of Engineering Physics Tsinghua University Beijing China Key Laboratory of Particle

answered in this kind of system 1 While the pitch is fixed in order to get a better quality how do we decide the thickness of the detectors What processing methods will improve the image quality 2 How can we accelerate the reconstruction and post processing to meet real-time applications such as interactive visualization and some vision tasks This paper addresses on three main issues we worked on for the fast SSDHCT imaging Firstly we briefly illustrate a helical CT reconstruction algorithm using a look up table to get an approximate volumetric reconstruction secondly examination on different detector thickness and post\255 processing methods 
are illustrated at last all the operations are implemented using GPU and the method is tested on a real sample machine II EFFECT OF DETECTOR THICKNESS AND POST-PROCESSING To study the effect of detector thickness on image of reconstruction we did experiments on two choices of detector The results are shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2 In Fig the reconstruction is from a full helical scan with multi-slice detector The projection data are as many as 160M bytes Fig.2 is the reconstruction using single slice detector CT of thin and thick detector There are only 8M bytes data in projection which are only

be distinguished by the detector the structure can be seen clearly in the reconstruction without being disturbed by artifacts In the baggage scanning application our purpose is to discover the danger which is usually a scale region of a special material so the result may satisfy our requirement In order to make the result more recognizable a smoothing filter should be applied after reconstruction In our work we examined the effects of two kinds of filters a Z axis smooth kernel and a three dimension smooth kernel 1.04 1.03 1.02 Figure 5 profile at z=140 Fig.6 Pipeline of GPU-LUT Back Projection As we can see in Figure 3 4 and 5 the filtering result from three dimension smoothing is better than the result from smoothing along Z axis only After filtration the artifacts can be much reduced and give a much improved reconstruction After the LUTBP on GPU the result is stored in a 30\255 texutre 0 three dimensional image smoothing can also be directly implemented on the GPU right away and the result can be shown immediately through ray casting or other volume rendering method Thus all the data processing is completed within GPU We compared the performance on speed between a CPU and a GPU Obviously the GPU gains more than 10 times speed-up plane for the volumetric results corresponding to Figure 2\(a Figure 2\(b Figure 3\(a and Figure 3\(b b Fig.3 post processing reconstructions by smoothing a smooth on axis _  _ L P\(A\(z,B x,y,B A 255 2  Z arctan  X-Z Blue GPU In order to fit the GPU pipeline we use a lookup table in the back projection LUTBP  2 On a CPU the lookup table will faster the helical CT reconstruction to some extend but on a GPU it can be used to achieve a big amount of speed-up[5 Since the calculation of every pixel in every slice is independent in the LUTBP the computation can be easily paralleled We implement it on a GPU so that the processing will be executed in 128 cores at the same time The pipeline of GPU based LUTBP is shown in Fig.6 c d Fig.4 Central slice image on Right smooth three dimensionally 3331 dsin\(y+B  f\(x,Y,z   b+d*cos\(y+B 0.5 a U Red after smoothing III ACCELERATING THE RECONSTRUCTION ON Green result before

  5 has been an important objectiv e for the SHINE system and has led to its design as a t oolbox of unique capabilities that may be used independently or collectively in the development of knowledge-based systems SHINE’s unique approach to knowledge representation knowledge-visualization and reasoning processes enables system designers to build high-performance expert systems previously only within the r each of “artific ial intelligence experts”. It is intended for those areas of reasoning where speed, portability, and reuse are of critical importance Such areas would include sp acecraft monitoring, control and health, telecommunication analysis, Policy Based Network Management \(PBNM\, network diagnosis information reduction and summarization, medical diagnosis, robotics or basically any area where rapid and immediate response to high-speed and dynamically changing data is required It comprises a collection of high-level software tools that revolutionizes the creation of efficient, reusable knowledgebased software systems \(see Figure 2\ike existing expert systems it generates only application-critical code thereby eliminating the need to deploy the complete environment.  Its unique approach to the creation of knowledge-based systems is based on sophisticated compiler technology, one of the fastest inference engines in the industry, and a large library of AI problem-solving techniques Figure 2: SHINE Development and Delivery Environment SHINE provides ultra computing performance on desktops computers that were previously not even available on large mainframe systems.  For ease of use and broad-spectrum applicability it directly interf aces with applications written in C, C++, ADA, JAVA, and LISP and generates native code for C, C++, and LISP With targets planned for ADA BASIC, FORTRAN, and JAVA SHINE has contributed to reduce operations cost and provides real-time response to any instrumented system.  In particular, it has been a valuable aid in monitoring and maintaining NASA satellite communication systems \(Deep Space Network spacecraft/military systems, improved reliability and safety in eight NASA deep space missions that include Voyager Galileo, Magellan, Cassini and Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer \(EUVE\ In summary, SHINE is a well tenured system and has been successfully delivered to many military and non-military projects and is licensed commercially FRONTIER Every conventional or intelligen t real-time data processing system requires a front-end co mponent to interface to the external world to acquire data, preprocess it and make it available for analysis.  This capability has been replicated a countless number of times for each new system that is built In an attempt to avoid this duplication of effort and to provide a plug-and-play com ponent functionality, we have developed FRONTIER.  It is a general-purpose front end for real-time analysis and reasoning systems.  FRONTIER is not limited to only advanced processing but is also directly applicable to any pr oblem where large volumes of data need to be collected, pr ocessed and recorded in realtime FRONTIER is responsible for interfacing to all external data sources, converting the raw data to higher-level data e.g., engineering units, normalization\oring it in a database and providing a gene ral information exchange between all reasoning components.  It is a component of a new class of integrated reasoning systems for fault detection, isolation, diagnostic s, recovery and prognostics Because of the potential time-cr itical nature of the problem we are addressing, great attention has been paid to providing real-time response fo r both the acquisition of the data from the real-time sources and rapid distribution of it to the components that use it It is designed as a reusable system, enabling it to be rapidly tailored to a broad class of reasoning and non-reasoning systems with a minimum amount of effort.  Each component of the system is programmable, executing in an embedded virtual machine.  Th is approach enables on-the-fly  reconfiguration of each elemen t, and the virtual machine implementation makes the system completely independent from the particular piece of hardware on which it runs.  The top-level elements of FRONTIER are written in C++ for real-time performance, however, configuration setups preprocessing and conversion algorithms, heuristic analysis and noise source definitions ar e written in a virtual language 


  6 that can be downloaded to each of the its components while they are running to provide hot swaps of software FRONTIER is composed of a hardware-specific interface to the external world and seven reusable components \(see Figure 3 Figure 3: FRONTIER Architecture Diagram  The eight components of the system, when unified, form a dynamically programmable gene ral purpose front end data processor that provides the following functionality   Source of all external data for all reasoning components via a consistent external interfaces   A uniform and ubiquitous exchange of data and information between reasoning components   A subscription-based relational database to store real-time data from extern al sources and distribute real-time and historic numeric and symbolic information between reasoning components   Filtering of real-time measurements to eliminate irrelevant data   Up- and down conversion of the sampling of measurements through programmable rate converters   Automatic correlation and alignment of timeskewed measurements so measurements properly arrive on actual or pseudo frame boundaries   Programmable numeric preprocessing of data \(e.g engineering units conversion, feature extraction   Programmable event detection based upon complex relational expressions through a rulebased language to provide inference annotation of measurements   All components of the FRONTIER are commanded and programmed through the subscription-based database   Optional socket-based interfaces between reasoning components so components can be remotely located CONCLUSIONS Verification and validation of software systems \(V&V\has been addressed by a broad range of methods, including static analysis, model checking, testing, runtime monitoring and formal proofs. In this paper, we describe the design of an introspection infrastructure for applications in an environment with a large number of parallel threads.  Our approach to introspection integrates the monitoring of executions, analysis of system state, and changes to the system state.  Compared to th e current state-of-the-art, the innovative features of our work include the following  We have designed a generic software framework for introspection providing a “backplane” capability with plug-in functionality, and realized by a set of asynchronous agents  The objects of the introspection capability are applications characterized by explicit and implicit concurrency, and executing on multi-processing hardware systems providing a large number of threads  Our design focuses on the requirements of future spaceborne systems that need to support an enhanced degree of autonomy and  provide application-specific adaptive fault tolerance  The combination of monitoring, analysis, and feedback-oriented modifica tion of system state has been described in the literature and partially implemented in a number of systems, but no design based on massively parallel multi-core architectures has yet been implemented Current approaches to V&V usually deal with individual methods in isolation.  While we do not at this time present a unified approach to V&V, we plan to combine elements of static analysis, formal proofs, and monitoring in our future work R EFERENCES AND C ITATIONS  Afjeh,A., Homer,P., Lewandowski,H., Reed,J.  and Schlichting,R.

information could be implemented without undue difficulty However lowering dependency on global knowledge is still valuable for the future of NASA missions not because such information is difficult to obtain but instead we want the network the adapt to changing mission scenario automatically therefore reducing the operational complexity and cost associated for network configuration and increase the robustness of the network during contingency situations During operation the algorithm uses mean  INTERVAL 38 interval_delay  0 more importantly knowledge of when to give up pursuit of that goal Since the only value known to the algorithm at start-up is the AR-PRESET which describes how aggressively was no contention After the start-up phase has completed the node's normal operation begins A node's normal operation consists of increase and decrease adjustments to the EDCA values The goal of the adjustments is to keep the ar in were not being shared with other nodes on comparing the current ar value to the AR PRESET for the station This derived value is called the ar ratio Table 3 shows example values that demonstrate how the ar ratio of the current ar to the AR PRESET influences parameter changes An a denotes assumes highest priority to get mean access delay is measured when the node was added The tolerance value adds padding to the decision to make parameter adjustments When the ar has been in the acceptable range for are made based can never reach comes online During Adaptive Algorithm start-up 30 ELSEIF ar 27 ELSE 28 relaxed_decrease 29 ENDIF or decreased in priority to TC3 Even though only small adjustments a stable condition and will fluctuate within the window of small adjustments For this reason a 9 1 FOR random in 0 to STARTUP 2 do nothing measure any physical 24 ELSEIF ar  AR PRESET 25 IF measure success or failure of the parameter adjustment After the change in access time and access delay to the base station For this short period the node lowers all parameters and near its AR PRESET goal volatile network conditions GOODH 23 break ar ratio  LOW 26 aggressive_decrease are made when an aggressive change while an r denotes an aggressive change and an adjustment will not be made the next time a new time period begins This feature allows the station to adapt quickly to current conditions The second important design decision involves finding a solution to this a node is given priority over all other nodes in order to estimate the minimum a relaxed change A  denotes a decrease in priority while a  denotes a relaxed change is made by the order in which the parameters a data flow is a period of time and the tolerance is high the ar must be out of the acceptable range multiple times to trigger an increase in priority The distinction between an unacceptable ar is found Table 3 Example Parameter changes can result since the ar will never be equal to the AR-PRESET In other words the algorithm by itself  AR PRESET 31 IF ar ratio  HIGH 32 aggressive_increase mean access delays gathered later This measurement is not intended to arRatio  0.5 0.5 0.8 0.8 1.2 1.2 2.0  2.0 Change arnone r access delay samples from before and after changes to the QoS values in order to access delay is assessed the delay is saved and a reliable method of providing a node with knowledge of its overall goal for its a data flow treats large ar values the node needs a way to discover the network's current performance status As a minimal a best case measurement to which it will then compare its or link layer capabilities but rather to find the performance possible if the medium or in other words if there an acceptable range Adjustments are changed For example according to the ordering explored in 4 an aggressive increase in priority would first try adjusting AIFS until exhausted then try CWmax then if the other two could not be adjusted it would try CWmin The upper and lower bounds of adjustment are the static TCO and TC3 parameters A parameter is considered exhausted when it has been increased in priority to TCO a tolerance mechanism a change Conversely when tolerance is low the ar must be in acceptable range multiple times in order to guarantee that 3 ENDFOR 4 aifs AIFS OPTIMAL 5 cwmin CWMIN OPTIMAL 6 cwmax CWMAX OPTIMAL 7 FOR counter  0 to START VAL by 1 8 optimal_delay  delay 9 ENDFOR 10 optimal delay  counter 11 aifs AIFS TC2 12 cwmin CWMIN TC2 13 cwmax CWMAX_TC2 14 15 normal_operation 16 17 interval delay  current-delay 18 IF time out  now 19 interval_delay  INTERVAL 20 ar  interval-delay  optimal-delay 21 ar_ratio  ar  AR-PRESET 22 IF ar ratio in range\(GOODL 33 ELSE 34 relaxed_increase 35 ENDIF 36 ENDIF 37 time out  now 39 ENDIF 40 41 GOTO normal_operation Figure 7 Adaptive Algorithm Pseudo-code

Figure 9 also highlights the difficulty in designing a dynamic algorithm that is stable for most network configurations For data point 5 and 9 jitter is difficult to predict based on the AR PRESET This variability is most likely a result of the tolerance mechanism presenting artifacts during certain network configurations If the algorithm chooses too aggressively for too many data flows the contention parameters are set more aggressively and performance in the network suffers Although jitter remains better than NoDiff for all data points in Figure 9 providing more consistent behavior should be a primary goal for future versions of the AA SD Video Jitter 0.07 0.06 0.05  0.04  0.03 0.02 0.01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT and TS Nodes Figure 10 SD Video Jitter The average jitter for SD video is shown in Figure 10 This data represents a lower priority level and as compared to voice jitter in Figure 9 is able to provide better predictability The data still shows that performance for AA experiences greater variability than Normal but over most data points is better than both NoDiff and Normal HD video performance is similar to SD but has greater overall jitter and is therefore not shown Telemetry Jitter o 045 o 04 4 NoDiff Normal 0 035 AA 0 03 025 0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT Nodes 11 0.015 0.01 0.0050 Figure 11 Telemetry Jitter In Figure 11 which shows the jitter for Telemetry the data exhibits similar characteristics as the data for voice jitter Due to inconsistencies in the settling of the algorithm performance does not follow the same curve as NoDiff or Normal however for most data points the performance is better than NoDiff Figure 12 Command Round Trip Time The RTT for Command data is shown in Figure 12 Similar conclusions can be drawn from this data as have been discussed previously This data also exhibits greater variability than Normal and better overall performance than NoDiff The behavior of AA closely resembles that of AA in Figure 11 which reinforces the conclusion that the builtin hysteresis of the algorithm does not fully accommodate all network configurations Overall the Adaptive Algorithm is able to meet its goals of being a distributed way to dynamically manage priority and still perform similarly to static prioritization and better than no differentiation at all The self correcting characteristic of the algorithm leads to increased variability in performance which in some cases such as extreme network load causes the Adaptive Algorithm to perform significantly worse than static prioritization On the other hand network throughput is improved when the network is under-utilized because the Adaptive Algorithm is only engaged when performance requirements are not being met When viewed as a trade-off between simplicity of deployment and performance benefits over non-prioritized networks the Adaptive Algorithm can provide significant value to network architects and TS 


9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an extension to 802.1l e that dynamically adapts the contention parameters to meet performance requirements of lunar communications We have explored the capacity of 802.1lg using dynamic 802.1le to handle VoIP command telemetry and video according to their respective QoS requirements The data presented here shows that the Adaptive Algorithm can be deployed in these scenarios to effectively manage priority without a complicated centralized infrastructure This capability will be essential for short-range lunar communications in that quick deployment will be a primary goal The prevalence of 802.11 hardware and the possibility of the 2.4GHz band to perform at long and short ranges make it a viable option for future lunar networks However priority will be a necessity especially if the network carries non-critical traffic alongside mission-critical VoIP and data Future work on the algorithm will include improvement to the tolerance mechanism to reduce added contention from over-adjustment It is possible that more testing with more conservative settings will result in less variable network conditions at the expense of faster convergence Although we feel that the algorithm presented here is important we believe it is not the total solution It has been shown in previous works that in general 802.1 le increases contention in the network which results in overall lower throughput The Adaptive Algorithm does alleviate this disadvantage for some scenarios but not all Other works show that 802.1 le under the HCCA can solve the problem of throughput at the expense of simplicity and rapid deployment Therefore we expect that many 802.11 e deployments will use a mix of pure EDCA and HCCA in addition to using EDCA as a backup measure for HCCA Having an efficient and simple way to use ECDA will provide network architects with greater flexibility and will further reduce dependence on proprietary network design as we move towards expansion beyond the Earth 10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at Clemson University under the South Carolina Space Grant Consortium Research and Education Awards Program REAP and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 lb 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 IEEE 1999 2 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 le 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 Amendment 8 IEEE 1999 3 Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM Support for Multimedia Applications with Quality of Service in Wi-Fi Networks Wi-Fi Alliance September 1 2004 4 Swaminathan Arvind and James Martin 2006 Fairness Issues in Hybrid 802.1 lb/e Networks Consumer Communications and Networking Conference 2006 3rd IEEE Vol 1 Issue 8-10 50-54 5 Wietholter Sven and Hoene Christian 2003 Design and Verification of an IEEE 802.1 le EDCA Simulation Model in ns-2.26 TKN Technical Report Series Technical University Berlin November 2003 6 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 Dynamic Tuning of the IEEE 802.11 Protocol to Achieve a Theoretical Throughput Limit IEEE/ACM Transactions On Networking Vol 8 No 6 December 2000 785-799 7 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 IEEE 802.11 Protocol Design and Performance Evaluation of an Adaptive Backoff Mechanism IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications Vol 18 No 9 September 8 Chen D S Garg M Kappes K Trivedi 2002 Supporting VBR VoIP Traffic in IEEE 802.11 WLAN in PCF Mode Center for Advanced Computing and Communications ECE Department Duke University Durham NC Avaya Labs Research New Jersey 9 Siris Vasilios and Stamatakis George 2006 Optimal CWmin Selection for Achieving Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate 802.1 le WLANs Test-bed Implementation and Evaluation International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking WiNTECH 06 10 He Dajiang and Charles Shen 2003 Simulation Study of IEEE 802.1l e EDCA Vehicular Technology Conference Spring 2003 Vol 1 685-689 12 ILREFERENCES

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
