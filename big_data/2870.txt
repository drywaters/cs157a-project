The DINET EOC housed ground nodes that produced and consumed \223payload\224 data that was relayed through the DTN router on board the DI spacecraft The EOC also controlled the topology among the nodes altering the connectivity to test DTN functionality.  An additional node in the EOC acted to perform administrative functions, and contained the Monitor and Control System to view experiment health and concurrently collect and analyze the data delivery status and statistics.

space networks formed by multiple relay radio links For example, to retrieve data from a rover on Mars, current practice is for the rover operations team to manually schedule the uplink procedure and files to be sent from the rover to an orbiter for relay to earth. The orbiter team likewise has to coordinate with the rover team, manually schedule the transmission of data from the orbiter to one of 3 DSN stations, which in turn use the internet to complete the transfer of data to the orbiter operations site, which then has to arrange to forward the appropriate files to the rover operations location If there are multiple orbiters that the rovers may use to relay data back to earth, additional operations teams have to be consulted.  If there are any anomalies or unplanned outages of the various radio links, the whole plan must be recreated 
by these teams. All-in-all this is a very labor-intensive process Normal internet protocols that can route around failures provide for quality of service and automatic retransmission of missing data will not work well, if at all, in a space network environment. Internet protocols require end-to-end connectivity; intermediate routers do not store any data, and if the next hop is not available, the packets are discarded Even with the existence of an end-to-end path from the operations center through the DSN, a relay satellite and thence to the rover, the light time delay to Mars would make many of the \223chatty\224 handshaking protocols \(like TCP unworkable. Were UDP used to transport packets over a 


  2 space network, a reliability mechanism would still be needed since retransmission is not done by UDP DTN was conceived and developed to work around these limitations of terrestrial internet protocols while maintaining interoperability with them. This, in effect, extends the internet into deep space networks The DTN suite of protocols provides for these features 1  Automated routing 2  Store-and-forward operation at intermediate DTN nodes \(analogous to terrestrial routers 3  Quality of service provisions 4  Authentication and encryption mechanisms 5  A link reliability / automated retransmission mechanism DTN \223bundles\224 are akin to internet \223packets\224, and the DTN bundles may be transported via radio using the Licklider Transport Protocol \(LTP - a reliability mechanism for deep space links ble link protocol, or via standard internet TCP/IP DTN addresses extreme and performance-challenged environments where continuous end-to-end connectivity cannot be assumed.  Recogniti on and interest in DTN has shown a rapid rise, with diverse applications ranging among such areas as battlefield communications, habitat and environmental sensor network monitoring systems, and mobile consumers having interm ittent connectivity with the Internet.  For example, the June 2008 IEEE Journal of Selected Areas of Communicati ons was dedi cat ed t o t h e DTN topic.  Space communications represents a key application domain for DTN, arising from disconnections as orbiters lose line-of-sight communications with landers long propagation delays over inte rplanetary links, and other phenomena.

Several elements are envisioned in the overarching program of advancing DTN\222s readiness, such as experiments on the Intern ational Space Station.  A critical development milestone is the first demonstration of DTN in a spacecraft flying in d eep space.  This experiment is known as the Deep Impact NETwork \(DINET\flight experiment DINET made use of the Deep Impact \(DI\spacecraft.  The DI prime mission successfully took place on July 4, 2005, in which a probe was released and impacted the Tempel 1 comet, producing a crater and ejecting material that was imaged by the DI spacecraft.  On July 3rd, 2007, NASA approved the Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact Extended Investigation \(EPOXI\ission.  EPOXI is a mission of opportunity that continues operation of the DI flyby objectives to 1 observations of stars known to have planets and photometrically detect extrasolar planets and to 2 encounter the Comet Hartley 2 In 2008, the EPOXI mission was expanded to incorporate DINET, a technology validation experiment of JPL\222s implementation of Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols DINET will take place during otherwise quiescent duration between the EPOCh \(Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact eXtended Investigation\he EPOXI mission.  DINET consists of uploading JPL\222s ION flight software onto one of the DI spacecraft\222s flight com puters.  In addition, ION software will be configured on several computers on the ground.  A virtual topology will be constructed, with the DI spacecraft acting as a DTN bundle relay node with data being passed among the other nodes.  Deep Space Network DSN\racking/communications passes were scheduled with the EPOXI mission to support this experiment and a number of specific DTN technology validation metrics were levied as requirements on the DINET mission.  DINET operations were conducted in autumn of 2008 Figure 1 depicts the basic layout of the virtual topology of 


  3 the experiment.  The central node is the Deep Impact spacecraft which serves as a bundle router to pass the payload data from one space regi on to another space region The central node is the DI spacecraft, which does not generate source data but acts as a DTN bundle router and also implements the LTP retransmission protocol in response to induced bundle loss.  The three end nodes simulate space regions, Eart h, Mars, and Phobos, and produce and consume the payload data.  These nodes are all computers on the ground also implementing the ION DTN software.  The ground node computers are contained within the Experiment Operations Center \(EOC\ich will be described in greater detail in the next section.  The links dashed lines\termittent depending on schedule  Figure 1 226 DINET virtual topology The ground computers physically connect to the DI spacecraft via the Deep Space Network \(DSN operates three complexes that are geographically distributed over the Earth to ensure coverage no matter where the spacecraft appears in the sky.  To connect to these complexes, interface equipment is maintained and operated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL\The intermediate interface system is referred to as DSOT \(Data System Operations Team\ is illustrated in Figure 2 below, divided into the primary components of the DI spacecraft, DSOT, and the EOC.  As depicted, additional nodes have been implemented beyond the simple diagram of Figure 1 in order to simplify integration and to enhance flexibility in operation.  Also visible in Figure 2 are the EOC Experiment Database and Load/Go elements 


  4  Figure 2 \226 DINET system components In the network, \223payload\224 data starts from one end node and is first routed to the ground system of that end node region then to the Deep Im pact spacecraft via RF links, then to the ground system of the destination region, and eventually arrives the destination end node.  The payload data are exchanged in the form of bundles.  The source nodes produce and consume data in the EOC using the Asynchronous Message Service  \(AMS C C S DS draft  standard publish & subscribe functions.  Thus the EOC plays the role of exercising th e data exchanges.  The EOC also controls the topology among the nodes, altering the connectivity to test DTN functionality.  In addition, the EOC monitors the delivery status among all end nodes.  A different node in the EOC acts to perform administrative functions, and contains the Monitor and Control System to collect and analyze the data delivery status and statistics essential for the developers to view experiments and perform post-analyses.  The software diagnostic messages and protocol diagnostic messages issued by network nodes are collected, analyzed, stored in to a database in real-time This application also provide s a web interface for viewing the data in real-time and for interactive database queries The messages includes ION soft ware status messages, ION bundle status report messages \(BSRs\and node publish/subscription messages 3  DINET  E XPERIMENTAL O PERATIONS C ENTER  An essential component of the DINET project is the Experiment Operations Center \(EOC\c functions of the EOC are 1  Produce Experiment Payload Data 225  Input: JPEG image files 225  Single file per bundle 225  Mark bundle priority 225  Meter output to specified data rate 2  Consume Experiment Payload Data 225  Store in local file sy stem at node upon reception 225  Display image upon reception 3  Consume Software Diagnostic Messages \(ION logs 225  ION log messages transmitted to EOC software via TCP/IP socket

Figure 3 shows the PTL  Figure 3 \226 Protocol Technology Lab The EOC played the role of exercising the data exchange and monitoring the delivery status among all end nodes Three machines in PTL were designated to simulate the end nodes \(\223Earth\224, \223Mars\224 and \223Phobos\224\ishing and subscribing to data using the AMS \(Asynchronous Message System\protocol over the ION network, where the data rate, DTN priority, and other transmission statistics were involved in the simulation and analysis.  Another three machines in the PTL were used to simulate the routers in the space regions located between the end nodes and the ground systems.  A seventh machine and two large screens in the PTL were employed as the administrative node and the visualization system to m onitor and analyze the data delivery status and statistics for the DINET experiment The execution of the Monitor and Control system in the administrative node helps researchers perform more informative and useful ION experiments.  Figure 4 shows the software architecture of Monitor and Control System and the relationship with other DINET elements 


  6  Figure 4 \226 DINET Structure and software for the administrative node  Software Modules of Monitor and Control System The Monitor and Control System is designed as a multi-tier client-server web application.  A middleware is used to service data requests between the user and the database This hierarchical structure ma kes the application extensible and distributive.  The framework of the Monitor and Control System in the EOC utilizes the technologies of Java,  JavaScript, AJAX, JSP \(JavaServer Page MySQL database to provide the means for the DTN network administrator to monitor ION data delivery and operational status effectively.  The devised infrastructure of the Monitor and Control system can be further extended to monitor the operation status, data transmission and the topology updates fo r other space mission simulations As shown in Figure 5, the Monitor and Control System in the EOC consists of four major executable pieces DINETLogProcessor, DINETAdm,  DINETQueryAdm, and DINETTopology.  DINETLogProce ssor sets up the TCP/IP socket connection to all simulated nodes to receive the ION status messages, parse and categorize the messages, and deposit the messages into the SQL database DINETLogProcessor also sends signals to DINETAdm via TCP/IP socket to inform of the arrival of status messages DINETTopology is a topology description generator which dynamically updates the network topology description in xml format based on the ION network configuration, which is initialized prior to missi on operations a nd updated during the course of the mission.  Similar to DINETLogProcessor DINETopology also notifies DINETAdm of any changes in the network topology via TCP/IP socket.  DINETAdm is a web-based graphic display system which updates the display of the network topology and the ION status messages in real time based on notices from both DINETLogProcessor and DINETTopology units DINETQueryAdm provides another web-based graphic display which interactively accep ts and responses to users\222 queries on ION status messages.  Under the four major executables, there are five libraries constructed to support several specific functions.  They are LibDatabase LibLogProcessor, LibSocket, LbLogProvide and LibTopology.  The functions of each library are described as follows 200  LibDatabase:  manipulate and interface to the database, including setting connections to the database, creating tables in the database, inserting data into tables, and querying table content 200  LibLogProcessor: build the database and tables for the experiment and parse, classify, and store messages in the database 200  LibSocket: set the socket on the server side and receive messages from remote clients 200  LibLogProvider: interface to LibDatabase Interpret the query issued from the application send the query to the database, and return the query result to the application 200  LibTopology: parse the topology description in xml format and draw the network topology with the use of a Java applet  


  7  Figure 5 \226Software modules of the Monitor and Control System Types of ION Status Messages The Monitor and Control Sy stem in the EOC received messages from all nodes in DINET during mission operations via TCP/IP socket and the ION stack.  The messages included ION softwa re status messages, ION Bundle Protocol status report messages, and publish/subscription messages.  All messages were formatted in consistent plain text style prior to arriving to the processing unit of the destination, i.e DINETLogProcessor at the administrative node of the EOC Bundle Protocol status reports were issued by all nodes in the network and sent to the administration node in the form of DTN bundles via the ION stack.  Bundles which contained the status reports were further logged into plain text format, as were other ION status messages.  Bundle status reports inform of the deletion of any undelivered bundle and the administrative node may choose to initiate some specific network mana gement action upon reception of the message.  ION software status messages were logged by all nodes and programmatically redirected to a mechanism enabling them to be transmitted to the administrative node via TCP/IP, not via the ION stack However, messages logged by the Deep Impact spacecraft were encapsulated in EVR telemetry packets.  As the ground system received these packets, it ex tracted the encapsulated log messages and re-transmitted the messages to the administrative node via TCP/IP socket connection ION status messages are of five general types: informational message, warning message, diagnostic message communication statistics message, and other status messages. Informational messages mainly inform the occurrence of events that ar e nominal but significant Warning messages inform of th e occurrence of events that are off-nominal but are likely due to configuration or operational error rather than software failure.  Diagnostic messages inform of the occurre nce of events that are offnominal and might be due to software errors.  A communication statistics message provides network performance statistics over a stat ed interval.  An \223other status message\224 is seen in response to specific operatorinitiated activity.  The publish/subscription messages denote the publish and subscription status from the end nodes involved in publish or subscription operations. All these status messages and statistics help the mission operations team keep abreast of the network data flow and experiment status Installation and Execution of the Monitor and Control System in the PTL In the PTL, the Monitor and Control software package is installed on a Linux workstation with two large screens which serves as the administrative node and visualization 


  8 system in EOC software devel opment.  One screen is used to display the main page of the Monitor and Control System GUI, and the other screen shows the GUI query page and xterm consoles of other nodes in the EOC.  Figure 6 is an example shot of the main GUI page. In the page, either an existing experiment name or a new experiment name is selected for executing operati ons.  There are 11 tables on the page which display live messages respectively received from DINET nodes.  The message display is started by selecting the \223start/update\224 button and temporarily paused by  selecting the \223Pause\224 button.  Moreover, all messages received and stored in the database can be dumped into a text file as the \223save\224 button is selected and a file name is entered. The top and middle of the page shows the network topology which is updated dynamically as the network connectivity changes  Figure 6 \226 Monitor and Control System GUI main page Figure 7 shows an example of the GUI query page.  In order to query the messages stored in the database, an experiment name is specified along with \(optionally\essage type message source node, number of messages, message creation time, and then the \223query\224 button is clicked.  The messages stored in the data which meet the query criterion are shown on the table of the query page, and those resultant messages can also be dumped into a text file by clicking the \223save\224 button and entering a file name.  The table content and topology display on both web GUI page are locally and dynamically updated without interfering with the display of the main page by the use of Ajax and Java servlet techniques

With the results gathered from the operations cen ter software, an analysis was performed on the experime nt outcome characterizing the overall performance of DTN From a broad perspective, the experiment was a success in that it proved the ION software capable of space mission operation and raised the technology readiness level to that of a tested and flown software package.  The DTN concept proved capable of automatically re-transmitting missing or corrupt data without flight team intervention, specifically demonstrated during several small unplanned communications outages at DSN stations.  DTN management actions were requi red to update the ION clock aboard EPOXI on a semiweekly basis to compensate for a drifting spacecraft clock, as well as insert new routes after an unplanned power outage across the EOC network Experiment analysis yielded DTN performance benchmarks in link utilization, prioritizati on, node storage and routing For all passes with sufficient data in the transmission queue DINET maintained a link utilization rate over 90%, even when introducing artificial link errors by dropping approximately every 32 nd LTP segment.  Received data analysis confirmed that higher priority information maintained an advantage over lower priority information and also that this advantag e increased as link capacity diminished \(due to the artificial data loss on the link\.  The node storage utilization benc hmark provided proof that node storage usage stabilized over the course of the experiment, approaching steadystate.  An analysis of network traversal showed that data was efficiently moved through different paths as dictated by the ION routing algorithm when the network topology changed. This demonstrated the advantages of the routing automation afforded by the ION routing protocol 5  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper has briefly described the JPL Deep Impact Network \(DINET\ay/Disruption Networking \(DTN technology experiment, intended to increase the technical readiness DTN for space missions and supporting ground and space-based relay infrastruct ure.  This represents the first deep space implementation of DTN in flight and ground software, and paves the way for future space networks.  DINET demonstrated the Interplanetary Overlay Network \(ION\mplementation of DTN, which incorporates the Bundle Protocol and LTP retransmission protocol.  We have described the DINET Experiment Operations Center \(EOC its functions in accomplishing this experiment.  The DINET EOC starts all ION processes experiment data sources, stat us message receiver processes and display processes.  The ION-based Monitor and Control System is an innovative, intranet-based software application which receives status messages and displays live results from the DINET network.  With this Monitor and Control application, the ION software and protocol diagnostic messages issued by network nodes are collected, analyzed stored into a database in real-time.  This application also provides a web interface for viewing the data in real-time and for interactive database queries 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology and the Nationa l Aeronautics and Space Administration

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
