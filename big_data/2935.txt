IEEE ICSCN 2007 MIT Campus Anna University Chennai India Feb 22-24 2007 pp.360-365 Multi-Layer Integrated Anomaly Intrusion Detection System for Mobile Adhoc Networks S Bose S Bharathimurugan2 and A Kannan3 Abstract Most intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or MAC layer traffic This paper focuses on the design of a new anomaly detection system for each node of the network which contains detection subsystem for MAC layer routing layer and application layer Audit data taken from MAC level/Network level/Application level from the traces in Glomosim and are preprocessed 
separately for each layer's detection subsystem Feature data sets for each layer are selected from normal transactions The Detection subsystem contains normal profiles obtained from the feature vectors of training data sets In our work we used Bayesian classification algorithm Markov chain construction algorithm and association rule mining algorithm for anomaly detection in MAC layer routing layer and application layer respectively for effective intrusion detection Test data obtained from the network traffic is feed in to the detection subsystems If there is any deviation from normal 
behavior it is considered as abnormal or anomaly based on predefined thresholds Intrusion results from detection subsystems of all the three layers are integrated at local integration module and the final result is sent to the global integration module Intrusion results are received also from the neighbor nodes and are sent to the global integration module for making a final decision I INTRODUCTION A mobile ad hoc network MANET is formed by a group of mobile wireless nodes without the assistance of fixed network infrastructure The rapid proliferation of wireless networks and mobile computing applications 
has changed the landscape of network security The nature of mobility creates new vulnerabilities due to the open medium dynamically changing network topology cooperative algorithms lack of centralized monitoring and management points and yet many of the proven security measures turn out to be ineffective Therefore the traditional way of protecting wired/wireless Department of Computer Science and Engineering Anna University Chennai-600044 India Email sbs 4cs.annauniv.edu1 bharathimurugans 4yahoo.co.in2 kannan 4annauniv.edu3 networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient We need to develop 
new architecture and mechanisms to protect the wireless networks and mobile computing applications In our work we proposed a new architecture that consists of three layers in wireless ad hoc networks namely MAC layer routing layer and application layer to find an effective anomaly detection model with less false positive rate in a distributed environment There are three major steps involved in our work to find the intruders First we collect the intrusion results from each anomaly detection subsystem Second we obtain the anomaly results from the local subsystem model 
using each layer subsystem results and finally we integrate the local subsystem anomaly results and neighbor node's anomaly detection result and decide the final intrusion results The main advantage of this multi-layer approach is the increase in detection rate due to the fact that the intruders who escaped from the detection system of one layer are caught in the other layer This intrusion result has been sent to the host Comparing with the existing works our work is different in many ways First we use a cross layer approach to improve 
the detection rate Second we use intelligent agents and data mining algorithms for effective intrusion detection in local and global integration Third we use a majority-voting scheme to get the best results from data mining algorithms The main focus of this paper is on experimental results rather than theoretical analysis Hence the mathematical models developed in our research work are not dealt with in this paper However from our mathematical analysis on the sample data sets and results we found that 5%0 level of significances a good statistical 
measure for decision-making and hence the threshold has been fixed at 5%0 level This intrusion result has been sent to the host The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 explains the related works Section 3 shows the proposed system architecture Section 4 illustrates the experiments and its results for the proposed architecture Finally Section 5 concludes this paper with future research II RELATED WORK Intrusion detection means identifying any set of actions that attempt to compromise the integrity confidentiality or 1-4244-0997-7/07/$25.00 C2007 IEEE 360 


IEEE-ICSCN Feb 2007 availability of resource 3 There are three types of intrusion detection as follows  Anomaly detection Deviation from baseline profile of normal systems  Misuse detection On the basis of knowledge of a model of intrusion process  Specification-based detection Defines set of constraints correct operation of a program or protocol In 4 it is given that that following procedure is utilized for anomaly detection  Select or partition audit data so that the normal dataset has low conditional entropy  Perform appropriate data transformation according to the entropy measures e.g constructing new features with high information gain  Compute the classifier using training data  Apply the classifier to test data  Post-process alarms to produce intrusion reports The vast difference between the fixed network where current intrusion detection research is taking place and the mobile ad-hoc network makes it very difficult to apply intrusion detection techniques developed for one environment to another The most important difference is perhaps that the latter does not have a fixed infrastructure and today's network-based IDSs which rely on real-time traffic analysis can no longer function well in the new environment In 1 a mechanism for intrusion detection and response has been proposed Compared with wired networks where traffic monitoring is usually done at switches routers and gateways the mobile ad-hoc environment does not have such traffic concentration points where the IDS can collect audit data for the entire network Therefore at any one time the only available audit trace will be limited to communication activities taking place within the radio range and the intrusion detection algorithms must be made to work on this partial and localized information 2 In summary we must answer the following questions in developing a viable intrusion detection system for mobile adhoc networks  What is a good system architecture for building intrusion detection and response systems that fits the features of mobile ad-hoc networks  What are the appropriate audit data sources How do we detect anomaly based on partial local audit traces if they are the only reliable audit source  What is a good model of activities in a mobile computing environment that can separate anomaly when under attacks from the normalcy In their pioneering work on intrusion detection in MANETs 1 Zhang and Lee describe a distributed and cooperative intrusion detection model where every node in the network participates in intrusion detection and response 2 In this model an IDS agent runs at each mobile node and performs local data collection and local detection whereas cooperative detection and global intrusion response can be triggered when a node reports an anomaly In paper 8 a cluster based intrusion detection approach is proposed It is explained how to provide more accurate information on attack types when an anomaly is found Moreover a set of rules that can identify the attack types of several well-known attacks is presented In paper 9 a statistical anomaly detection algorithm based on Markov chains has been proposed It involves two steps construction of test suite and construction of a classifier Construction of test suite contains the training data and test data Statistical model is created using the Markov chain construction algorithm Construction of classifier involves building a model which will detect anomalous behavior The result of the system will be anomalous or normal In paper 7 Markov chains are used to describe the normal transitions that occur for different TCP and IP headers In 4 a data mining method that performs cross-feature analysis to capture the inter-feature correlation patterns in normal traffic has been proposed In 5 MAC layer anomaly detection based on cross-feature analysis to capture the inter-correlation patterns among features of MAC layer has been proposed In 6 routing anomaly detection based on Markov chains has been proposed In paper 10 a specification based intrusion detection system to detect attacks on AODV Ad hoc OnDemand Distance Vector has been proposed In paper 11 real-time intrusion detection that uses knowledge base to detect real-time attacks has been proposed In 12 an algorithm for prevention and detection of MAC layer misbehavior to deal with problems of colluding selfish nodes has been proposed In 13 it is given that a straightforward way to detect power attacks to measure the power on a process-by-process basis thus determining which processes were responsible for consuming large amounts of energy In 14 three main forms of sleep deprivation attack on generalpurpose mobile computers namely Service request attacks benign power attacks and malignant power attacks have been proposed In 15 IDS model architecture with agents to monitor attack related activity within a wireless local area network has been proposed Comparing with all the works in the literature our work presented in this paper is different in many ways First it is distributive and to be placed in each node of the network Second it is cooperative since it considers the neighbor node's intrusion result in the decision process Finally it has detection subsystems for three layers namely MAC routing application Our simulated results show that our integrated 361

supports and that handles in particular the conjunction of constraints used in this paper The estimate of the number of patterns based on the pattern space sampling was implemented in Perl For each single extraction with exact support the running time was about a few tens of seconds to a few minutes In the case of soft support an extraction takes from a few tens of minutes to several hours to complete while for the sampling-based estimate computing one estimate requires between 1 and 30 seconds 4.2 Application to Real Data We use two datasets of DNA sequences that are promoter sequences of genes Each sequence is a string of 4,000 symbols over an alphabet of size 4 nucleotides a c g and t  The 036rst dataset r 1 contains promoter sequences of 29 genes and dataset r 2 contains promoter sequences of 21 genes These two datasets represent two biologically opposite situations of interest and extracting string patterns that have a high support in r 1 and a small support in r 2 is a way to identify putative binding sites of transcription factors molecules that bind on the promoter sequences to activate or to repress a gene The data were prepared and provided by Dr Gandrillon and his team We look for patterns satisfying MinFr  002 r 1 f 1  006 MaxFr  002 r 2 f 2  006 002   k  and for the support we used the soft support de\036nition with 003 1 slightly degenerated occurrences Such a conjunction of constraints with soft support de\036nition based on the Hamming distance has been shown to be useful in practice for transcription factor binding sites identi\036cation  The estimates were computed with distribution M D using as symbol frequencies their respective frequencies in the data 0.23 0.26 0.27 0.24 respectively for a c g and t  In this case the model is more a description of the random background than a description of the biological organization along the sequences Representative graphics obtained using these estimates and depicting portions of the extraction landscape are presented in Figure 4 on the right A typical use of such graphics is for instance to look for points in the parameter space corresponding to a large support on r 1  but a low support on r 2  a large pattern size and a rather small number of expected patterns since here the distribution represents the random background Such a point that can be used as an initial guess of the parameters to perform real extractions is for instance pattern size 10  minimal support on r 1 of 15 and maximal support on r 2 of 5 the graphic in the middle on the right indicates that for this setting only about 1 pattern due to the random background is expected For the sake of completeness in Figure 4 on the left we give the real numbers of extracted patterns In practice these graphics are not easily accessible to the user since in these experiments the running time of a single extraction ranges from several tens of minutes to several hours while for an estimate only a few tens of seconds is needed Even though the global trends correspond to the estimates they are important differences in some portions of the parameter space these differences could be expected since the distribution used does not incorporate complex biological knowledge However the estimates can still be used to help to choose initial parameter values in an exploratory mining stage and moreover 036nding such differences when running the real extractions can also be a useful piece of information in itself For example for the setting pattern size 10  minimal support 15 and maximal support 5 we have about 100 patterns really extracted while we expected only one If we suppose that the pattern space sampling can provide reasonable estimates when the data satisfy distribution M D as supported by the experiments of Section 4.1 then the 100 patterns obtained are likely to be due to a particular unknown structure in the data and not to the distribution M D only This suggest that it makes sense to look for patterns in this region of the parameter space since we can expect to obtain some interesting/useful patterns not only patterns due to the random background captured by M D  5 Related work Estimating the expected number of patterns that satisfy a constraint is in general much more dif\036cult than estimating the probability that a given pattern satis\036es such a constraint This second problem has received a lot of attention leading to many statistical measures to assess the interestingness of the patterns Concerning the 036rst problem only a few solutions have been proposed and 8 analyze the feasible distributions of frequent itemsets also of closed itemsets for and of maximal itemsets f or 12  focuses on the k ind o f d istrib utions one can e xpect for various kinds of datasets They answer the question whether there exists a frequent or maximal frequent itemset collection that has a given number of frequent itemsets of a given length computes the a v e rage number of frequent closed itemsets using probabilistic techniques These authors especially focus on minimal frequency threshold and how it in\037uences the number of extracted patterns considering 036xed and/or proportional thresholds Another approach has been proposed by Geerts et al  p ro viding a tight upper bound on the number of candidate patterns that can arise while mining frequent patterns in a level-wise setting Given the current level and the current set of frequent patterns they propose a tight bound of the maximal number of candidate patterns that can be generated on the next level In the domain of string mining designs an estimate of the number of patterns due to the random background and that are likely to be extracted with respect to

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDDÕ06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821–830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDDÕ99  pages 43–52 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDDÕ01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDMÕ05  pages 713–716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SACÕ06 Data Mining  pages 546–552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117–132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODSÕ03  pages 284–295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILPÕ05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
