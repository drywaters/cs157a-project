For a given predicted item, a collaborative recommendation association rule set 10  is th e sma llest a s so cia tio n ru le set th a t ma kes th e  same recommendation as the entire association rule set by confidence priority. Several approaches to hide collaborative recommendation association rules from static databases have been proposed [10, 11  How ever  frequent updates to the database may require repeated sanitizations of original database and added data sets The efforts of previous sanitization are not utilized in these approaches. In this work, we propose using pattern inversion tree to store the added data set in one database scan. It is then sanitized and merged to the original sanitized database. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach out performs the direct sanitization approach on original and added data sets, with similar side effects  1. Introduction  Privacy-preserving data mining, is a novel research direction in data mining and statistical databases, where data mining algorithms are analyzed for the side effects they incur in data privacy. There have been two types of privacy concerning data mining. The first type of privacy called output privacy is that the data is minimally altered so that the mining result will not disclose certain privacy Many techniques have been proposed for the output privacy o r ex am pl e, pert u r bat i o n  bl ock i ng   aggregation or merging, swapping, and sampling are some alternation methods that have recently been proposed. The second type of privacy input privacy is that the data is manipulated so that the mining result is not affected or minimally affected [2-4  For ex a m ple, th e  reconstruction-based technique and the cryptographybased techniques are some recently proposed techniques for input privacy In output privacy, given specific rules or patterns to be hidden, many data altering techniques for hiding association rules have been proposed.   However databases may be updated frequently. It is non-trivial to maintain the hidden association rules when the database is updated. New rules and/or already hidden rules may arise and need to be hidden again. In this work, we are interested in improving the efficiency of hiding collaborative recommendation association rules when the transaction database is updated, i.e., when a transaction data set is added to the original database. This problem is referred to as the maintenance of hiding collaborative recommendation association rules.  We propose here using pattern inversion tree to store the added data set in one database scan.  It is then sanitized and merged to the original sanitized database. Numerical experiments and running time analyses show that the proposed approach out performs the direct sanitization on original and added data sets, with similar side effects  2. Problem Statement  Association rules mining was introduced in [1 L e t      2 1 m i i i I 000  be a set of literals, called items Given a set of transactions D where each transaction T in D is a set of items such that I T 002 an association rule is an expression Y X 000 where I X 002  I Y 002 and 003  004 Y X The problem of mining association rules is to find all rules that are greater than the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence As an example, for a given database in Table 1, a minimum support of 33% and a minimum confidence of 70%, nine association rules can be found as follows B=>A \(66%, 100%\=>A \(66%, 100%\B=>C \(50 75%\=>B \(50%, 75%\B=>C \(50%, 75%\C=>B 50%, 75%\ BC=>A\(50%, 100%\=>AB\(50%, 75

Database D before and after sanitization TID D D T 1 ABC AB  T 2 ABC ABC T 3 ABC ABC T 4 AB AB T 5 A A T 6 AC AC However, mining association rules usually generates a large number of rules, most of which are unnecessary for the purpose of collaborative recommendation. For example, to recommend a target item {C} to a customer the collaborative recommendation association rule set that contains only two rules, B=>C \(50%, 60%\B=>C 50%, 60%\, will generate the same recommendations as the entire nine association rules found from Table 1 Therefore, a collaborative recommendation association rule set can be informally defined as the smallest association rule set that makes the same recommendation as the entire association rule set by confidence priority In this work, we are particularly interested in the following: given a transaction database D a minimum support, a minimum confidence and a set of recommended items Y a sanitized transaction database D  and a new data set   the objective is to minimally and efficiently modify the updated database D  D   uch that no collaborative recommendation association rules containing Y on the right hand side of the rule will be discovered As an example, for a given database D in Table 1, a minimum support of 33%, a minimum confidence of 70%, and a hidden item Y = {C applying the DCBS algorithm proposed in  D if transaction T 1 is modified from ABC to AB, then the following rules that contain item C on the right hand side will be hidden B=>C \(33%, 50%\, AB=>C \(33%, 50%\owever, four rules are lost, C=>B \(33%, 60%\, AC=>B \(33%, 66 C=>AB \(33%, 66%\B=>AC \(33%, 50%\d no new rule is generated are the side effects. The sanitized database is D shown in Table 1 When a new data set   T 7 BC, T 8 B, T 9 ABC} is added to the database D there are direct and indirect sanitization approaches. For the direct approach applying the DCBS algorithm proposed in  D  D    directly, the transaction T 6 is sanitized from AC to C and T 7 is sanitized from BC to C. The sanitized database   D is shown in Table 2 as   D DCBS\. The following rule containing item C on the right hand side will be hidden: A=>C \(44%, 57%\ \(44%, 57 One new rule is generated C=>AB \(44%, 100%\d hiding failure is generated AB=>C \(44%, 80%\ side effects. There is no lost rule. However, this approach requires re-processing of the old data set D For the indirect approach, the new data set   is processed or sanitized first. The old sanitized database will be sanitized only when hiding failure persists and/or side effects get worse. Using the proposed MSCR algorithm described in the next section, the old sanitized database D  is not processed. Only the added data set is sanitized and the resulting sanitized database is shown in Table 2 as   D MSCR\ur objective here to minimally and efficiently modify the updated database D  D    such that no collaborative recommendation association rules containing predicted item Y on the right hand side of the rule will be discovered  Table 2.

Proposed Algorithm  In order to hide an association rule X=>Y we can either decrease its supports  N X or N Y X   be smaller than pre-specified minimum support or decrease its confidence X Y X  be smaller than pre-specified minimum confidence. To reduce the number of database scanning in generating large or frequent itemsets in association rule mining, a one-scan of database method was proposed in   T h e bas i c i d ea i s t o  construct a tree structure, called Pattern tree \(P-tree\d a frequency list which contains the frequency counts of each item in one database scan. The pattern tree is then

restructured to a compact Frequent-Pattern tree \(FP-tree proposed by h i c h i s an ex t e n d ed pref i x t ree  structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns in less space In w e propos ed a Pat t e r n I nv ers i on t r ee \(PIt r ee based on the pattern tree to sanitize collaborative recommendation association rules with one database scan A PI-tree is similar to a P-tree except the following. Each node in a PI-tree contains three fields: item name \(or item number\umber of transactions containing the items on the path from the root to current node, and list of transaction ID that contains all the items on the path from the root to current node To sanitize the collaborative recommendation association rules of updated database D  there are two possible approaches as mentioned in section 2. One approach is that we can re-run any hiding algorithm on the updated database D  directly. The second approach is to process the newly added data set   incrementally and combined it with the sanitized result of original database D For the second approach, a collaborative recommendation association rule in D does not have to be a collaborative recommendation association rule in   or D  and vice versa. However, if all collaborative recommendation association rules in D and in   are sanitized, then all collaborative recommendation association rules are sanitized in the updated database D   We will adopt this strategy to sanitize the collaborative recommendation association rules in his work Based on the strategies described above, we propose a data-mining algorithm called MSCR for the maintenance of sanitizing collaborative recommendation association rules. The basic steps of the algorithm are described as follow Algorithm MSCR Input 1\itized database D  or pattern inversion tree  P I and frequency list  L   2\in_support 3\min_confidence  4\et of hidden items Y  5\ded data set    Output: a sanitized database   D  D  D   where rules containing items of Y on RHS will be hidden 1.

Merge PI-trees    PI and  P I to obtain   P I  6. Restructure   P I according to   L  7 Output sanitized database   D   4. Numerical Experiments  In order to better understand the characteristics of the proposed MSCR algorithm numerically, we perform a series of experiments to measure various effects and compare with the direct sanitization DCBS algorithm proposed in T h e f o llo w i ng eff ect s are con s idered  time effects, side effects, and database effects. For time effects, we measure the running time required to hide one and two predicting items, i.e., one and two collaborative recommendation association rule sets respectively. For side effects, we measure the hiding failure; new rules generated and lost rules. The hiding failure side effect measures the number of collaborative recommendation association rules that cannot be hidden. The new rule side effect measures the number of new rules appeared in the transformed database but is not in the original database The lost rule side effect measures the number of rules that are in the original database but not in the transformed database. The database effects measure the percentage of altered transactions in the database Figure 1 shows the processing times required to maintain the sanitized collaborative recommendation association rules under multiple updates. Multiple updates mean more than one data set is added to the original database in sequence. For example, in Figure 2, the original database has data size D 10k  5k, and  is added to the D three times in sequence. The processing time required to sanitize 10k is 31.82 seconds to hide one item and 63.82 seconds to hide two items Adding the first 5k data set, MSCR algorithm requires 45.42 and 84.54 seconds and DCBS algorithm requires 71.88 and 143.51 seconds for hiding one item and two items respectively. The 20k data size refers to adding second 5k data set to the previously sanitized 15k data set Figure 2 shows the percentage of transactions altered using MSCR and DCBS algorithms. Even for different database sizes, the percentages of altered transactions remain almost constant, about 4.5% for MSCR and 5.5 for DCBS with one predicting item. This indicates that the processing time should increase proportionally as the size of dataset increases. Figure 3 shows the various side effects of MSCR algorithm hiding two predicting item There are about the same percentage of rules to be hidden for both MSCR and DCBS algorithms. There is no lost using MSCR or DCBS algorithm. There are about 6% of

new rules generated for each 5k data set and about 1.13 of association rules are hiding failures for each 5k data set for MSCR algorithm           Figure 1.

Conclusion  In this work, we have studied the database privacy problems caused by data mining technology and proposed an efficient data-mining algorithm MSCR to maintain sanitized collaborative recomme ndation association rule sets. The proposed algorithm incrementally sanitized the added data set and merged with the previously sanitized database with one database scanning using patterninversion trees. Example illustrating the proposed algorithm is given. Numerical experiments are performed to show the time effects, database effects, and side effects of the algorithm and compared with direct database sanitization algorithm. In addition, running time analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. It can be seen that the proposed MSCR algorithm out performs the direct sanitization algorithm DCBS in processing time with similar side effects. In the future, we will consider the problem of efficient maintenance of privacy for other types of rules and patterns when databases are updated. In addition, the issue of how side effects affect the level of privacy will be studied  6. References   1  R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.

comes with a minimal support threshold in determining its simple solution is to use a predefined item list to build the HFPfrequent items In the next section we will explain the details on tree This however will significantly deteriorate the system how to parse a user s query to generate such threshold values performances because any list without taking item frequency into consideration will lead to an inferior solution and eventually 6 Discovering Relational Patterns Using HFPraise the cost in tree construction For this purpose we propose a rank-join based ranking mechanism Tree Given M databases D1 D2  DM for HFP-tree construction 6.1 User Query Decomposition assume I I2  and IN are the union of the items in the databases As we have discussed in Section 4 a user's query may involve For any database Di we scan it and rank all items in Di in a multiple relationship factors and operators When submitting descending order of their frequency Denoting Rj the ranking such a complex query to the data mining model it is often the order of item Ij in database Di with the first item in the list case that not all parts of the query comply with the down closure denoted by 1 then Eq 1 will represent the average ranking property i.e the subset of a frequent itemset may also be order of each item Ij The final ranking list for all items is frequent For example the  and  relationship factors constrg R j 2,..N in an ascending order normally do not comply with the down closure property It is constructed by ranking R  j=1,2 N in an ascending order obvious that even if a pattern iB say abc does not satisfy B  where items with the least average ranking are listed at the top  but its superset say abcd may still comply with B  3 i  I M Therefore the mining process must preprocess a user's query and M Yi=1 1 explicitly decompose it into a set of subqueries which do comply The above mechanism joins the ranks of each item in all with the down closure property such that the mining model can databases together to produce the final ranking By doing so we use these subqueries to facilitate the candidate pruning process assume that databases are equally weighted and the rank in all For this purpose we list five properties here and will use these databases plays an equal role in deciding an item's final ranking properties to decompose each query before it is submitted to the In reality the size number of transactions of the databases data mining model All decomposed subquieries which comply involved in the query may vary significantly where a database with the down closure property are placed into a Down Closure containing more transactions should carry more weight in DC subset and meanwhile the original query is still kept to deciding the final ranking of a particular item For this purpose check a pattern's validity at the final stage we revise Eq 1 by taking the size of each database into Property 6.1.1 If a subquery has a single database and a consideration Assume Si is the number of transactions in Di then threshold value x listed on the left and right side of the S=Sl\261S2\261..\261Sm denotes the total number of transactions The relationship factor 2

For example a subquery like A+B+C  a complies with the 6.2 Relational Pattern Discovery Using HFP-tree down closure property and can be directly put into the DC set The proof of this property is trivial Given a pattern P and any of The construction of the HFP-tree ensures that the set of frequent its subpatterns Q assuming P's and Q s supports in A B and C itemsets for transactions in all

property is true relational patterns Figure 4 gives the pseudo code of the mining This property states that if a subquery sums up multiple databases t ogP g process which mainly consists of two procedures HFP-mining and is followed by factors 2 or  and a threshold value a and HFP-growth In the main procedure HFP-mining an input then it should be placed into the DC set for pattern pruning query Q is first decomposed into a set of subqueries DC Then Property 6.1.3 If a subquery has the support difference of two the system recursively calls HFP-growth to discover relational databases say A-B and a threshold value ux listed on the left patterns from the HFP-tree where the DC set is used to prune out and right side of factors 2 or  respectively then this unnecessary candidates on the fly and the query Q is used at the subquery can be further transformed into a subquery like A   final stage to assert the validity of the patterns which still complies with the down closure property Given an HFP-tree built from the multiple databases the HFPIt is obvious that if A-B  a then A  B+a Since a pattern's growth first checks each node ai in the header table of the tree support in a

involving g In Figure 3 g's header table has recorded six denoted by 6 digital numbers from 1 to 6 For It is obvious that if IA-BI 2 a then we have A B  a or A B each location say location 1 tracking from g upwards towards  u which lead to the inequations A  B+-x or B  A+a i.e the Root will produce a set ecba We replace the support of A  a B a For any pattern P if its supports in A and B each item in the set by the current support of g and it will are both less than u there is no way for P's superset to have a produce a path e 1:0 c 1:0 b 1:0 a 1:0 which is called a higher support than ux Therefore it still complies with the down hybrid prefix path HPP for g It is understandable that an HPP closure property records items and their frequencies w.r.t to each database which co-occur with g and have a higher rank than g in the list L Property 6.1.5 A subquery involves relationship factors  or Parsing all the HPPs of g should be able to produce frequent  will most likely not comply with the down closure property itemsets associated with g The HFP-growth will start from the and therefore cannot be placed into the DC set item with the lowest rank for pattern growth For this purpose With the above five properties we can decompose most complex for any item in the hybrid prefix paths of g we sum up its queries into a set of subquries which comply with the down frequencies w.r.t to

7.1 HFP-tree Construction Results consequently grow faster in finding frequent patterns as shown in Figure 6\(c In Section 5.1 we have proposed a joint ranking list which ranks items from different databases for HFP-tree construction We Since the joint ranking list unifies the ranking order of each item report in this section the performance of this ranking mechanism from different databases one may argue that why we don't just in facilitating tree construction and pattern growth processes We treat all items as they were from one single database e.g apply Q in Table 3 on the synthetic databases and use both the D=DJ+D2+D3 and then rank the items according to their total joint ranking list and the fixed ranking list to build HFP-trees frequencies with infrequent items in each database removed We report the results in Figure 6 where Figure 6\(a denotes the beforehand just like the traditional FP-tree method does comparison of the HFP-tree construction time Figure 6\(b However such a global ranking list reviews items as they come represents the comparison of the total number of HFP-tree from a single database without considering their frequencies in interior nodes and Figure 6\(c reports the comparison of the each single database which may produce a list inferior to the one HFP-growth time In all figures the x-axis denotes the support from the joint ranking list For example if the frequencies of threshold a in Ql and the y-axis denotes the results of different items a b c in D1 and D2 are 3000 1000 900 and 100 measures The meaning of each curve in Figure 6 is explained in 2000 1000 respectively The global ranking list will sum up Figure 5 each item's frequency and produce the list L=abc on the other hand the joint ranking list will produce the list L=bac As shown in Figure 6\(a the proposed joint ranking list can Considering that the most possible frequent itemsets in D1 and D2 dramatically reduce the time in building an HFP-tree from are bc instead ac or ab the joint ranking list may lead to multiple databases where the lower the support threshold a the better results in reality Figure 6\(a also reports the HFP-tree more significant the improvement can be observed When wa=2 construction time of the global ranking list which further it will cost the fixed ranking list and joint ranking list about 98 supports our analysis The HFP-growth on the tree built from the seconds and 60 seconds respectively to build the HFP-tree on global ranking list also needs more time than the one built from the other hand when ux becomes significantly low say 0.01 the joint ranking list and we therefore omit the results from this the cost of the joint ranking list increases to about 98.5 seconds mechanism in Figures 6\(b and 6\(c which is about 3.5 times less than the time of the fixed ranking list 364.8 seconds A low ux value will have most items in the 7.2 Query Runtime Comparison database become frequent and therefore be added into the HFPFigure 7 reports a detailed runtime performance comparison tree This can be very time consuming if the inserting process between DRAMA and two simple solutions SPV and CPM on does not take item frequency information into consideration Q in Table 3 where the x-axis denotes the support threshold because each item needs to check with the existing HFP-tree to value ux and the y-axis represents the system runtime in seconds find whether the current path already contains this item or not For a detailed comparison we also list the actual value of each The more the frequent items the fatter the HFP-tree and the method in the figure When the threshold value is relatively small more time is going to be spent on this process On the other hand say 0.05 or 0.01 the runtimes of SPV and CPMare extremely a ranking order which unifies the item frequency information large which makes no sense for comparison the empty cells from all databases can significantly reduce the time in inserting each transaction into the HFP-tree because each item a will have Overall DRAMA linearly responds to the threshold value uX and less search space in verifying whether the current node of the does an excellent job in answering the query Ql When the value HFP-tree already contains a or not In addition since the joint of ox is larger than 1.5 we notice that DRAMA is inferior to ranking list has items sorted by their frequencies before they were both SPV and CPM A further study shows that for large ux values inserted into the HFP-tree it will have a better chance compared the time for HFP-tree construction becomes significant to the fixed ranking list to force items in a frequent itemset to follow a single path and consequently reduce the size of the constructed HFP-tree As shown in Figure 6\(b the interior node Joint ranking list Fixed ranking list Global ranking list number of the HFP-tree built from the joint ranking list is about _ 1 to 10 less than the tree built from the fixed ranking list Because of the HFP-tree quality improvement more compact Figure 5 The meanings of curves in Figure 6 and less interior nodes the HFP-growth process will 2913270 12663270 51

compared to the time for HFP-growth For example when of DRAMA consistently and significantly better than CPM for all lo=1.5 DRAMA spends about 68 seconds on building the the queries HFP-tree however it only costs about 9 seconds for the HFPgrowth to mine the patterns At this support value level SPV SPy CPM applies an FP-tree based algorithm on D1 which outputs only 96 100000 p atterns for D2 to veri fy S o the performance of SP Vat wx=1 5  i s really just the runtime of the FP-tree mining on D On the other 10000 hand when the threshold value decreases the patterns generated from D1 can significantly increase which leads to a huge runtime expense for D2 to verify these patterns notice that database 100 scanning for pattern verification can be very expensive especially for large databases For example when a=0 10 DI 10 00    will generate about eighty thousand patterns which need to be a 0.01 verified by D2 among which about ten thousands patterns will DRAMA 131.6 122.6 116.4 106.9 96.1 77 67.3 further need to be verified by D3 As shown in Figure 7 the sPv 15787 10233 759 169 72 24 sequential verification mechanism of SPV needs more than ten CPM 29192 1064 245 89 29 thousand seconds to check all those patterns For DRAMA SupportThreshold  although the tree construction at this level a=0.1 costs about 96 seconds the integrated pattern pruning mechanism will Figure 7 Query runtime comparison on Q in Table 3 significantly reduce the HFP-growth time to about 20 seconds only So in total DRAMA can answer Q in about 106 seconds Table 4 Query runtime comparison on Q2 Q3 Q4 and Q5 in which is a huge improvement compared to SPV Table 3 a-0.5 F0.01 Although our analysis in Section 2 suggests that Collaborative Algorithm Q2 Q3 Q4 Qs Parallel Mining CPM may possibly outperform SPV because of DRAMA 157.1 135.6 129.5 147.7 the underlying collaborative mining process in candidate pruning CPM 3172 1125 1094 2957 The results in Figure 7 indicate that this is not the case Because CPM needs multiple databases to forward their candidates to a central place for collaborative mining by pruning unqualified 7.3 Case Study on a Real-world Dataset candidates we can only apply Apriori on each single database To further assess the system erformance of our roposed effort So the system performance of CPMis crucially bounded by the y pe p p on real-world datasets we download the US 2000 census micropoor performance of Apriori based algorithms When the support data from the IPUMS 26 which provides census information value a is large say 2 the performance of Apriori and FP-tree about the US residents individuals and households We use 1 is almost identical since not many items can be frequent sample of the year 2000 census data with forty seven attributes However for small x values the situation can be totally different Those attributes cover age household/personal income education For example when a=0.1 about 680 items in D1 are frequent race citizenship poverty and family relationship etc Because which produces more than 230 thousand length-2 patterns from many attributes contain multiple attribute values and some D1 although collaborative pattern pruning can somewhat remove attributes are numerical we further discretize each continuous some candidates it still leaves a large number of candidates for attribute and extend the total attribute to 587 distinct items We D1 to evaluate This huge burden significantly slows down the intentionally collect the data from four states California New performance of CPM and makes it almost unbearable in York Florida and Vermont corresponding to datasets CA NY answering many queries However being worse than SPV does FL and VT Depending on the number of populations in each not necessarily mean CPM is useless As we have analyzed in state the size of the dataset varies from 6000 Vermont to over Section 2 some queries like Q2 in Table 3 cannot be answered by 330,000 records California SPV because no mining from a single database can produce answers for Q2 For such situations CPMbecomes useful Table 5 reports a runtime performance comparison among To answer a qeylk 2weneamDRAMA CPM and SPV with dataset settings Dp=CA D2=NY To answer a query lke Q2 we need a minng process which iS D3=VT and D4=FL and two sets of support threshold values able to unify multiple databases into one view Both DRAMA Because SPV is not able to answer Q2 and Q5 its results in the and CPM can possibly attain this by using their collaborative corresponding cells are set to N/A Because census data are not mining and pattern pruning process where only patterns with randomly generated like the synthetic data item frequencies are their support satisfying D1  D2  ut or D3hD4  u are kept not random with many items frequencies significantly higher for further actions For DRAMA instead of prefiltering any than others So the support threshold values a and 8 we choose single infrequent items before the HFP-tree construction we will are relative high But even so we can see that DRAMA4 build an HFP-tree by using all items in the transactions and then consistently outperforms both SPV and CPM with a significant let HFP-growth prune out the candidates on the fly This runtime improvement The results in Table 5 indicate that mechanism turns out to be very efficient in reality as the HFPdifferent from the synthetic data CPM actually has a much better tree construction in this case spends only 105 seconds which is performance than SPV in answering some queries In fact when about 7 seconds more than ou=0.010  As shown in Table 4 a40 and fr50  although it will cost FP-tree mining about 5 where the value of Ut is fixed to 0.50 the run time performance seconds to mine patterns from D1 there are over ten thousand of DRAMA is much better than CPM in answering Q2 Table 4 patterns generated from D1 with the longest pattern containing 13 has further listed a runtime comparison between DRAMA and items All these patterns need to be verified by D2 which CPM in answering other queries in Table 3 with the performance increases the runtime
