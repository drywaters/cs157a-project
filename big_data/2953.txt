 David.Taniar@infotech.monash.edu.au    Abstract Clustering as an intelligent technique for mining XML documents has been utilised as an excellent way of grouping the documents by their content or structure. A main step in many distance based XML clustering algorithms is to calculate pair-wise distances between documents; naturally a time-efficient technique requests the pair-wise distances to be determined in a timely manner.  In case of dynamic XML documents, the amount of changes between versions cannot be predicted. Therefore, in case of clustered dynamic XML documents, if changes were little or if they affected only some of the clustered documents, recalculating pair-wise distances every time would be highly redundant. In this paper we propose a time-efficient technique to reassess pairwise distances between clustered dynamic XML documents which change in time, without performing redundant calculations but considering the previously known distances and the set of changes which might have affected the documents versions   1. Introduction  With the spread of XML usage for data representation and exchange between applications [8  it  a l s o ca m e the request for intelligence in manipulating XML documents. XML mining algorithms aim to determine interesting knowledge \(patterns in data or structure association rules etc\ or to help in efficient information retrieval \(via clustering, classification etc From a database perspective, clustering as an intelligent data mining task tries to find dense regions in a data set, using some distance measurement, based on the assumption that data space is not uniformly occupied by data points   Research work has previously shown that the process of clustering XML documents can not just use the traditional clustering techniques. This is because i\ XML comes with a flexible way of storing the information, allowing the document to change depending on specific application requirements and \(ii an XML document combines the actual data with hierarchical relationships information between elements. Therefore, a number of XML-specific clustering techniques have been proposed [5   6    1 4     In an XML clustering approach, the distance between two documents implies the notion of documents similarity XML documents have specific structure and each XML node also carries a semantic meaning \(via its tag or name Therefore an XMLbased clustering solution can be seen as a set of XML documents grouped by their structural  semantic or structural and semantic similarity So far, the issue of clustering XML documents has been approached from two main directions \(detailed examples are given in the \223Related work\224 section a  clustering static XML documents - in this case the documents to be clustered are all known and available in advance, before running the clustering algorithm. The documents do not change therefore the pair-wise distances are calculated only once; the resulting clustering solution is static b  clustering series or streams of XML documents 226 in this case, the documents to be clustered are not known in advance; they become available one by one, and the algorithm recalculates the distance between each incoming new document and the existing clusters With the increased use of XML [9  w e h a v e  identified a third case, that is, when some \(or all\ of the already clustered XML documents change their structure or content in time, in order to reflect the dynamic of the application.

clustered documents change, the previous clustering composition might become obsolete if changes were so significant that the modified documents were reallocated to different clusters or if new clusters were formed In our previous work, we named this type of documents as dynamic XML documents; they inherently contain the notion of time, whereby at least one element indicates the temporal coverage of the specific version of the document  13   Techniques for incremental or online clustering have been already proposed for metric data, but in our opinion they are not directly applicable for dynamic XML documents. The topic of clustering dynamic multi-versioned\ XML documents has not been thoroughly researched so far: in a clustering solution which contains dynamic XML documents members the new document versions are not available beforehand, nor entirely new documents \(they only differ in a certain degree from their previous versions hence, none of the two types of existing XML-based approaches mentioned above \(clustering XML static or clustering XML series\ can be efficient for dynamic XML documents. This is because any of them would treat the new modified versions as completely new and different XML documents \226 in this case redundant calculations would be performed in order to recalculate the new similarity of each new version with the rest of the clustered documents In this paper we propose a novel and intelligent technique to reassess the new distances between clustered dynamic XML documents, not by running pair-wise full documents comparisons every time when documents change, but by directly assessing the effect of the historical changes on the previously known distances between documents   2. Related work  In this section we discuss some of the existing work in the area of clustering XML documents, stressing the fact that any of the existing work does not deal with efficiently reassessing clusters of dynamic XML documents. Two main directions of research can be noticed, in this regard: \(i Techniques for clustering static XML documents and \(ii Techniques for clustering series of XML documents  In [5  t h e  mo s t ty p ic al s t r u c tu r al c h a r ac te r is t ic s o f  a set of XML documents are subsumed in a \221XML cluster representative\222. The XML documents are seen as trees and the cluster representative is built in three steps: building optimal matching tree, building the merge tree and pruning the merge tree. The optimal matching tree is also called a \221lower-bound tree\222 and it is a tree in which any node deletions leads to a worsening of the total distance between each tree in cluster and its representative. Oppositely, the merge tree, also called \221upper-bound tree\222, is a tree in which a node insertion leads to a worsening of the abovementioned total distance. The authors argue that their proposal is efficient in building query plans on clustered documents, by comparing queries with cluster representatives\222 structures In [6  X M L d o cu m en t s ar e co n s i d e r ed t o b e  rooted, ordered and labelled trees and structural summaries are inferred from them, by nesting and repetition reduction. A \221tree edit distance\222 between each pair of structural summaries is calculated and the clustering phase is based on the \221structural distance\222 between structural summaries Starting from the fact that only 48% from the XML documents on the web are based on a schema [9 t h e  work in p r o po s e s t o m a ke us e  of  bo t h s t r uc t u ra l  and semantic information in schemaless XML noted mPaths\ from the analysed documents and finding similarity between them; each mPath is a three-tuple path sequence, attribute sequence, content sequence A different approach is introduced by w h e r e  each XML document to be clustered is \221broken\222 down into ePaths, which are sequences of nested elements with the most nested one being a simple content element. A two-dimensional bitmap index is built to detect the ePath contained in documents; then, a threedimensional bitmap index \(BitCube\ is built by adding the \221words\222 dimension to the previous two-dimensional index. Three types of operations can be applied on BitCube, that is, \221ePath slice\222, \221word slice\222 and 221document project\222. Also, because the BitCube can be very large and very sparse, a number of approaches are proposed in order to enable easy access to information in BitCube.A technique for clustering series of heterogeneous XML documents \(XCLS\ was proposed in [10   Th e a u th o r s co n s i d er s er i es  s tr eam s  o f X M L  documents and calculate the similarity between each incoming XML document and the existing clusters by using the concept of \223level structure\224. In this way similarity is determined at cluster level rather than pair-wise for individual documents in the clusters As mentioned in the previous section, both types of existing XML clustering techniques \(static and series do not respond well to the issue or clustering dynamic XML documents, because a dynamic XML documents cannot be classified as neither static nor as new document in series

D 2  D 2 D 1  Property 1 Higher the similarity between two documents, smaller the distance between them Property 1 says that two documents are said to be identical \(that is, have maximum similarity\, when no operations are required to transform one into another; in other words, the distance between documents \(total cost of operations\ is 0 When one or more XML documents inside the clustering solution change \(some of the nodes are updated, deleted or inserted\he distance \(thus the similarity\ between the modified document and the rest of the documents changes as well. The number and type of changes affecting each modified document will certainly influence the new similarity between itself and the other documents in the clustering solution Consequently, after the changes are applied, each modified document can be in one of the following situations: it might be still contained by the cluster which initially contained it, it might be contained by a different cluster, it might form a cluster by itself or with other documents etc.; a new clustering solution composition can only be obtained after determining the new distances between all pairs of XML documents available We show in Figure 1 an overview of the identified problem.

Figure 1 Overview of the proposed technique to reassess clustering solution composition   In this paper we propose an intelligent and timeefficient technique for reassessing the distances between clustered dynamic XML documents after they change, not by running full pair-wise comparisons but by calculating the effects of the changes on the previously known distances, that is on the distances before documents have changed  3.

This option would be very expensive from the operational point of view, because there is no distinction made between documents affected more or less by the set of changes; hence, in case of: \(i new versions of documents carrying only a small amount of changes or ii\ documents not modified at all, some \(or all\ operations involved in the full comparison of each pair of documents would be unnecessarily repeated The second option option B \226 our proposal s to make use of the already known distances between pairs of XML documents in the clustering composition before the changes and the set of temporal changes, and use them together to reassess the new modified distances. This option has two major advantages

o  for any pair of XML documents, our proposal reassesses the new distance only if at least one of the documents was changed; oppositely option A would do a full comparison and would recalculate the distance even if none of the documents in the pair was modified o  for any pair of XML documents, our proposal acknowledges the fact that the modified documents are not entirely new documents, but versions of \223dynamic\224 ones, therefore there will always be a certain degree of similarity between the new and old versions Our proposal depicted in Figure 1 can be therefore split in two main steps   Step 1 Initial clustering run \(one-off, not repetitive\: \(1a\ run any distance based clustering algorithm for XML documents and determine the clusters; \(1b\ record the matrix of distances between all pairs of XML documents, together with the direction of minimum cost in each case \(see Definition1 The output of Step 1 is called the \223initial clustering solution\224 and forms the base for the first run of Step 2 Step 2 Reassessing clustering solution composition \(this is repeated after each set of changes or whenever an up-to-date clustering solution view is required\: \(2a\ get the set of changes between the initial clustering run and current timestamp; \(2b\ get the latest matrix of distances between pairs of XML documents; \(2c reassess each distance based on: previous distance, direction of minimum cost and set of changes The output of Step 2 is called the \223reassessed clustering solution\224 and forms the base for the next run of the iterative Step 2 Certainly, the most critical phase in the iterative Step 2 is reassessing the distances \(phase 2c\, based on the previous distances and set of changes. We present in the next section our proposed method to achieve this  4. Distance measurement  For the purpose of the technique presented in this paper, the term of XML document also called XMLdoc refers to a well-formed and valid XML document, which has unique identifiers attached to each node note that the method used to assign IDs to nodes is not critical\ and an attached  tree representation T  In case of dynamic \(multi-versioned\ XML documents, each new version is a new XMLDoc  obtained by modifying the previous version; this is done by applying a combination of insert  update  and delete operations to the document version nodes The sum of these operations is known as delta and this term is usually associated with the difference between two consecutive versions of an XML document Definition 2 Given a dynamic XML document in two states D and D\222 where D

 7. Conclusions  In this paper we have proposed an intelligent and efficient technique to reassess the distances between dynamic XML documents when one or all of the initially clustered documents have changed. After the changes, the initial clustering solution might become obsolete - the distances between clustered XML documents might have changed more or less depending on the degree of modifications \(insert update, delete\hich have been applied. Re-running full pair-wise comparisons on the entire set of modified documents is not a viable option, because of the large number of redundant operations involved Our proposed technique allows the user to reassess the pair-wise XML document distances, not by fully comparing each new pair of versions in the clustering solution, but by determining the effect of the temporal changes on the previously known distances between them. This approach is both time and I/O effective, as the number of operations involved in distance reassessing is greatly reduced  References  1  Beringer, J. and H\374llermeier, E., Online clustering of parallel data streams Data and Knowledge Engineering 58\(2\,  2006, 180-204 2  Catania, B. and Maddalena A., A Clustering Approach for XML Linked Documents, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22202\, IEEE 2002 3  Chen, M.S., Han, J. and Yu, P., Data Mining: An Overview from Database Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol. 8, 1996, 866-883 4  Cormen, T., Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R Introduction to algorithms, MIT Press, 1990 5  Costa, G., Manco, G., Ortale, R. and Tagarelli, A., A tree-based Approach to Clustering XML documents by Structure, PAKDD 2004, LNAI 3202, 137-148 Springer 2004 6  Dalamagas, T., Cheng, T., Winkel, K.J. and Sellis, T 2004, Clustering XML documents by Structure SETN 2004, LNAI 3025, 112-121, Springer 2004 7  Ester, M., Kriegel, H.P., Sander, J., Wimmer,M. and Xu, X., Incremental Clustering for Mining in a Data Warehousing Environment, Proc.of the 24 th VLDB Conference, New York, USA, 1998 8  Garofalakis, M., Rastogi, R., Seshadri, S.

5 Related Work There exists extensive previous work on both the mining of software repositories and on the use of clustering algorithms in software engineering This discussion focuses on the most similar and recent work in the area of software evolution Mining Software Repositories Our technique was partially inspired by the work of Zimmermann et al and Y ing et al 17 on the mining of association rules in change history As described in Section 1 we sought to expand the technique to be able to recommend larger but less precise clusters of elements to guide program navigation Bouktif et al also investigated how to recommend cochanges in software development As opposed to the work cited above Bouktif et al used change patterns instead of association rules Also their approach does not attempt to reconstruct transactions and can consider associated 002les that were changed in different transactions ChangeDistiller is a tool to classify changes in a transaction into 002ne-grained operations e.g addition of a method declaration and determines how strongly the change impacts other source code entities Our approach uses similar repository analysis techniques but is focused on providing task-related information as opposed to an overall assessment of a system's evolution Finally repository mining can also be used to detect aspects in the code In this conte xt aspects are recurring sets of changed elements that exhibit a regular structure Aspects differ from the clusters we detect in the regular structure they exhibit which may not necessarily align with the code that is investigated as part of change tasks Clustering Analysis The classical application of clustering for reverse engineering involves grouping software entities based on an analysis of various relations between pairs of entities of a given version of the system Despite its long and rich history  e xperimentation with this approach continues to this day For example Andreopoulos et al combined static and dynamic information K uhn et al used a te xtual similarity measure as the clustering relation and Christl et al used clustering to assist iterative semi-automated reverse engineering The main dif ferences b e tween most clusteringbased reverse engineering techniques and the subject of our investigation is that the entities we cluster are transactions rather than software entities in a single version of a system For this reason our analysis is based strictly on the evolving parts of the system Both Kothari et al and V an ya et al 15 recently reported on their use of clustering to study the evolution of software systems The idea of using change clusters is the same in both works and ours but the purpose of the work is different Kothari et al use change clusters to uncover the types of changes that happened e.g feature addition maintenance etc during the history of a software system Vanya et al use change clusters which they call evolutionary clusters to guide the partitioning of a system that would increase the likelihood that the parts of the system would evolve independently In contrast we cluster transactions based on overlapping elements not 002les to recommend clusters to support program navigation as opposed to architectural-level assessment of the system Finally Hassan and Holt evaluated on 002ve open source systems the performance of several methods to indicate elements that should be modi\002ed together This study found that using historical co-change information as opposed to using simple static analysis or code layout offered the best results in terms of recall and precision The authors then tried to improve the results using 002ltering heuristics and found that keeping only the most frequently cochanged entities yielded the best results As opposed to our approach the evaluated 002ltering heuristics were only applied on entities recovered using association rules and not using clustering techniques The focus of their study was also more speci\002c as they recommend program elements that were strictly changed  as opposed to recommending elements that might be inspected by developers 6 Conclusion Developers often need to discover code that has been navigated in the past We investigated to what extent we can bene\002t from change clusters to guide program navigation We de\002ned change clusters as groups of elements that were part of transactions or change sets that had elements in common Our analysis of close to 12 years of software change data for a total of seven different open-source systems revealed that less than 12 of the changes we studied could have bene\002ted from change clusters We conclude that further efforts should thus focus on maximizing the quality of the match between the current task and past transactions rather than 002nding many potential matches Our study has already helped us in this goal by providing reliable evidence of the effectiveness of some 002ltering heuristics and useful insights for the development of additional heuristics Acknowledgments The authors thank Emily Hill and Jos  e Correa for their advice on the statistical tests and the
