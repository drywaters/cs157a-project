NAFIPS 2005 2005 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Web Usage Mining Using Rough Sets Natheer Khasawneh Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering University ofAkron Akron OH 44325-3904 natheer\(&uakron.edu Chien-Chung Chan Department of Computer Science University of Akron Akron OH 44325-4003 chan@cs uakron edu Abstract This paper studies the use of a rough set based learning program for predicting web usage In our approach web usage patterns are represented as 
rules generated by the inductive learning program BLEM2 Inputs to BLEM2 are clusters generated by a hierarchical clustering algorithm applied to preprocessed web log records Empirical results show that the prediction accuracy of rules induced by the learning program is better than a centroid based method In addition the use of a learning program can generate shorter cluster descriptions 1 Introduction One objective of web usage mining is to extract sequential usage patterns from a large collection 
of web logs 1 These patterns can be used to predict users access patterns to identify users intention and to provide timely help for using features available on a web site Since web log records are usually designed for debugging purposes they need to be preprocessed before applying data mining techniques 2 Five preprocessing steps have been identified 3 I Data Cleaning Remove irrelevant data such as log records for images scripts help files cascade style sheet 
etc 2 User Identification To group together records for the same user Because web logs are recorded in a sequential manner as they arrive therefore records for a specific user are not necessary recorded in consecutive order rather they could be separated by records from other users 3 Session Identification To divide pages accessed by each user into individual sessions A session is a sequence of pages visisted by a user We also call it as a 
usage sequence 4 Path Completion To determine if there are important accesses which are not recorded in the access log due to caching on several levels 5 Formatting Format the data to be readable by data mining systems Once web logs are preprocessed useful web usage patterns may be generated by applying data mining techniques such as mining association rules mining clusters and mining classification rules 4 5 6 In this work we study web usage mining by using 
a hierarchal clustering algorithm to generate clusters from preprocessed web logs then these clusters are used as training examples for a rough set based inductive learning program BLEM2 7 to generate rules which represent usage patterns Rules generated by BLEM2 are associated with four quantities support certainty strength and coverage In the study support of a rule denotes the number of usage sequences matches the rule Certainty of a rule is the conditional probability of an 
activity given a usage sequence satisfies the condition of the rule Activities are labels of clusters generated by the hierarchical clustering algorithm Strength of a rule is the probability of the usage sequence denoted by the left hand side of the rule Coverage of the rule is the probability of an activity matched by the usage sequence The BLEM2 rules are used for predicting users activities based on their certainties Effectiveness of the proposed mining system is evaluated by using log 
files collected from the University of Akron registration web server In the following section we present the workflow of the proposed mining system Section 3 describes the preparation of data set Empirical results are presented in Section 4 Conclusions are given in Section 5 followed by references in Section 6 2 Mining System Components There are two major component of the mining system used in this study a data preprocessing component and a 0-7803-9187-X/05/$20.00 02005

clustering and classifier component They will be presented in the following subsections 2.1 Data Preprocessing These are general rules and they may change according to the purpose of the mining system 2.1.2 Users Identification As shown in Figure 1 there are four steps in data preprocessing data cleaning user identification session identification and data filtering Path completion is not considered in this study r Records from _ Identification Data Cleaning User Web Log Identification Web Data Filtering Session Sessions Figure 1 Data preprocessing component 2.1.1 Data Cleaning Web logs are designed for debugging purposes in a way the web accesses are recorded in the order they come 2 and due to the connectionless nature of the HTTP i.e each request is handled in a separate connection for a single user to surf a website that will result in huge number of records in the web page that are not necessary in sequence rather they could be mixed with records for other users So for each page component such as image cascading style sheets file html scripting file or java script a separate record is recorded in the web log file Usually each record in the web log file has the following standard format 8  remotehost is the remote hostname or its IP address  logname is the remote logname of the user  date is the date and time of the request  request is the exact request line as it came from the user  status is the HTTP status code returned to the client and  byte is the content-length of the document transferred Usually for web mining purposes the only interesting element are the HTML pages and the scripting pages such as jsp asp or php pages unless the other file types are playing a navigation role in the web application and they are part of the web structure In the cleaning phase the pages types that are related to the navigation structure are kept and the other pages are eliminated The status filed in the web log can be used to keep the successfully fulfilled request and delete the others Finally the mining process can be limited to certain time or date so only transaction during such time and date will be considered User is defmed as a unique client to the server during a specific period of time The relationship between users and records is one to many Each user has one or more records to identify it The users are found based on two assumptions 1 Each user has a unique IP address during his browsing time span that means other users can have the same IP address during different time span 2 Maximum of 30 minutes for the user to be in ideal state after that the user will be considered that he left the website 2.1.3 Session Identification Using the website ontology we can identify different sessions in a single user's visit We assume that the website ontology is already available Work on retrieving web site ontology can be found in 9 10 11 A web site is defined as a triple W  P L F where P  P   Pk web site pages which is a list of k pages and k is an arbitrary integer L web site links which is the group of links for the web site Each link 1  P Pd  is defmed by two pages the source page ps where the link starts from and the destination page  Pd where the links ends to F  fo  f1     fn,l  web site functionalities where Vf F f Pss Pe  The web functionality f consist of at least two pages the start page and the end page and zero or more pages in between The session identification algorithm will take the users identified in the previous section and divide them into different sessions using the website functionalities From the website functionality we can identify some pages that are considered as breaking point for the session such as sign in or sign out page 2.1.4 Data Filtering After the data is been separated into different sessions filtering is done based on removing the house keeping pages the house keeping pages are the pages that are necessary for the web application to run properly they are not called directly by the user rather they are called internally by the requested page These pages shall be identified by the website designer and can be found using 581 


the website ontology Removing the pages can result in redundant pages which can be misleading to the distance function 2.2 Clustering and Classification In this section we present web usage classification and prediction using hierarchical clustering and BLEM2 learning algorithm An inference engine is used to evaluate the overall results based on the holdout classifier accuracy estimator 12 The workflow is shown in Figure 2 Cluster Estimation Results Figure 2 Web sessions clustering and classification Figure 2 shows that web sessions along with similarity/dissimilarity matrix are used in the clustering process to generate examples that represent users behavior over the web Major part of the examples are used to generate rules that describe the usage patterns the generated rules along with the rest of the examples are used by an inference engine to estimate accuracy of the mining results The rules are used for both predicting users behavior based on past navigation history and describing the cluster of users usage sequences in terms of what functionality the user is trying to do For example one cluster may consist of predominantly freshman students who register classes while another may consist of professors who upload their classes grades 2.2.1 Hierarchical Web Sessions Clustering Clustering web sessions is to group similar website usage behavior together We chose to implement hierarchal clustering algorithm for its ability to deal with nominal attributes and to deal with different sequence sizes and its ability to adopt different similarity/dissimilarity functions It starts by placing each web session in one cluster then it merges similar web sessions together until forming one cluster that has all the web sessions in it or other termination condition exist At the first step the dissimilarity measure between web sessions is computed by multidimensional session comparison method MSCM 13 After the first step is completed and the first level of clusters is generated new clusters are formed using Ward's distance measure 14 where the distance between two clusters is the sum of squares between the two clusters summed over all sessions in the cluster This procedure tends to combine clusters with a small number of observations It is also biased toward the production of clusters with approximately the same number of sessions 2.2.2 Cluster Description and Classification We used two methods for cluster description one is based on the centroid and the other is based on rules generated by BLEM2 The centroid for each cluster was selected based on Ward's method 14 By using the centroid as a way to describe the clusters each cluster will then be described by one usage sequence For example if cluster Ck has session si as its centroid which represents the following page sequence Si P45,P84 P204 From the page names look up the sequence has the following page physical names Si  signon BeforeClassSearch ClassSearch The cluster can be described as Class Search cluster meaning it contains group of users who are searching for classes Besides using this description for labeling the clusters this description was used as a way to predict users behavior From the above example the following rule can be generated if Si  p45 andsi2 P84 andsi.3 p204 thensi E ck The BLEM2 method is to use rules generated by a learning program to desribe the clusters For each cluster we may have more than one rule so we may have more than one description Or we can keep the rule with maximum support if one description is desired 3 Data Preparation In our experiments the data is collected from the University of Akron registration website log files from October 2003 to September 2004 General statistics about the data is presented in the following 3.1 Data Overview The total number of records recorded in the web server for the time period mentioned was 28,294,229 records Each record in the web log file represents a page request 582 


processed by the web server the monthly records hit is shown in Figure 3 The figure shows high web traffic on the month where there is a major activity such as registration release of final grades or starting of semester For example it can be seen from the figure that there is a high traffic volume in January since this is when the final grades for fall semester are released and the spring semester starts Figure 3 Monthly record counts in the web log 3.2 Data Selection For experimental purposes we have selected the data records for few days in which there is major activity on the web server Table I shows the selected dates along with the major activity The total records for the selected dates were 1,582,292 records which represent 5.6 of the total records Table 1 Selected dates and major activity Date Major Activity Monday Dec 15 2003 Teachers insert the grades Tuesday Dec.16 2003 Final grades due for Fall 2003 Monday May 10 2004 Teachers insert the grades Tuesday May 11 2004 Final grades due for Spring 2004 Friday Feb 20 2004 Summer Registration begin Friday Oct 24 2003 Sprint Registeration begin Friday April 02 2004 Fall 2004 Registration begin 3.3 Data Cleaning In this step we identified several page types and their percentages as shown in Table 2 Since we are interested in the scripting files that imply direct requests by the user we kept the asp and html files We removed files with other extensions The second cleaning step was to remove incomplete requests This can be tracked using the status code in the log file Table 3 shows the status code the code description the total number of records and the percentage We kept the records with status code ok and we removed other records so we are left with 76 of the data Table 2 Different file extension in the selected data set Page Extension Count Percentage Html 33307 2.10 dll 186 0.01 No extension 2148 0.14 php 2 0.00 htm 6938 0.44 txt 68 0.00 ico 645 0.04 jpg 1510 0.10 asp 1537485 97.17 js 1 0.00 xml 2 0.00 Total 1582292 Table 3 Requests status Code Status Code Description Page Count Percentage 206 Unknown 20 0.00 207 Unknown 3 0.00 304 No Change 17826 1.13 302 Not Found 322728 20.40 400 Bad request 74 0.00 200 Ok 1206982 76.28 403 Forbidden 17491 1.11 Matching not 404 found 1536 0.10 Facility not 501 supported 10 0.00 Unexpected 500 condition 15622 0.99 Total 1582292 100.00 3.4 User and Session Identification The selected data is loaded into a SQL database table in which each row has three fields data time url then we run a session identification script which is based on the algorithm described in 13 Each session is a sequence of accessed pages and each user may have more than one 583 Monthly Record Counts Recorded in the Web Log  450 400 L 350 0 300 C 25 a?f 150 200 O l50 50 Cor _ r _ 0 e c   O W  C  0 M 0 Data

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
