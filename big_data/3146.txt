the double linked list will be used for the storage of the temporal data According to the notions of the timemodel a double association rules mining is developed We also have proposed that a kind of algorithm and analyses about the result of the algorithm Keywords Double Association Rules Temporal Dataset Time-Model Hash Table 1 Introduction Data mining 1 researches the process of extracting implicit previously unknown and potentially useful information from large quantities of data With the explosion of the current data large datasets 
in electronic form than at any time heretofore Various techniques have been employed to convert the data into information including clustering classification regression association rule induction sequencing discovery and so forth We pay more attention to the temporal data to avoid processing huge data in real database New knowledge discovery from temporal databases is a popular task in data mining Association rules mining 2 is identified as one of the important problems in data mining Let us first define the problem for a database containing 
a set of transactions where each transaction contains a set of items An association rule has the form of where and are sets of items In such a rule we require that the frequency of the set of items is above a certain threshold called the minsup The frequency also known as support of a set of items is the number of occurrences of in or the number of transactions in that contain The confidence of the rule should also be above a threshold By confidence we mean the probability of given Following the original definition 
by Agrawal et al 2 the problem of association rule mining is defined as Let I ji i2,..jni be a set of n binary attributes called items Let D  t1,t2,...,tm be a set of transactions called the database Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I A rule is defined as an implication of the form X>Y where X,Y5I and XnY=0  The sets of items for short itemsets X and Y are called antecedent left-hand-side or LHS 
and consequent right-hand-side or RHS of the rule Time is also an important factor in real databases We should extract useful information under the strict application of temporal database So we also present a temporal relation model restricted within time limits The enterprise need to analyze the amount of data to form an exact estimation of customs purchase power during a particular period of time Based on the positive association rule and the notion of the time-model we propose a new kind of one called double association rule It denotes a strong association 
among data in the temporal database 2 Problem definition 2.1 Temporal relation Temporal relation 3 is described as a relation involving time As the application of the relation database grows it's important for us to get more information in each period of time So we present the temporal database which is a database with built-in time aspects e.g a temporal data model and a temporal version of structured query language.we consider it as a series of snapshots which can be treated as the traditional relation database 
Considering a relation pattern as follows EMP   Name Dept Sal Valid Names Dept and Sal are all the classical attributes while Valid is the other kind with the domain of d1-d2 So the triple on EMP is described as follows Kx y,z di d2  We can express that a person named x works in the department y with a salary of z The relation which consists of this kind of triple should be called temporal relation 978-1-4244-2020-9/08/$25.00 02008 IEEE 543  


as follows 544 1-1I 1 a purchase basket 2.2 Time-model The sequence of natural number can be used for the denotation of time N 1,2  Every element in N is a time spot while time is disperse and liner And then the element can be treated as second minute hour day week month and year etc In a general way we consider the element as the day Definition 2.1 Let IJ 5 N I\256\(&J={\(i,j i I je J,i j  forever  N 256 N present i i i E N Any subset of forever is temporal relation and N is radix So we can see that forever and present are all temporal relation In addition 0 is also a temporal relation We can define week month and year as follows For example let 1=Monday 2=Tuesday  1 1 1 2 1,7 2,2 2,3 2,7 week   6,6 6,7 7,7 8,8 8,9 8,14 9,9 9,10 9,14 T T T T I I T~~~~T F TF T u U T u T T UI1 T  J Definition 2.2 More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time These attributes go together to form bi-temporal data Valid-time denotes the time period during which a fact is true with respect to the real world Transaction-time is the time period during which a fact is stored in the database Bi-temporal data combines both Valid and Transaction Time 4 Given a temporal instance T T is valid on the time i so T reflects valid-time instead of transaction-time We can set T,=T,+1 when there is no change from i to i+1 Double association rule Based on the positive association rule we propose a new kind of rule which is called double association Definition 2.3 Following the notion of positive association rule and time-model the problem of double association rule is defined as Let I  i1 i2  in  be a set of n binary attributes called items Let D  t1,t2,...,tm be a set of transactions called the temporal database Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I A temporal rule is defined as an implication of the form X od Ywhere X Y I  XrnY=0 andddenotedasatime spot with the value of ds-de s e 1,2 The sets of items for short itemsets X and Y is called antecedent lefthand-side or LHS and consequent right-hand-side or RHS of the rule It is called double association rule when X d and Y d X show up at the same time We consider the rule which has the form of X rd Y as the double association rule Now we give an example to explain this notion Somebody bought the merchandise X before the merchandise Y There is just a record that somebody bought the merchandise X after the merchandise Y It is called double association rule 2.3 Temporal relation table A ternary three-valued or trivalent logic sometimes abbreviated 3VL is a term to describe any of several multi-valued logic systems in which there are three truth values indicating true false and some third value This is contrasted with the more commonly known bivalent logics such as Boolean logic which provide only for true and false 5 As with bivalent logic truth values in ternary logic may be represented numerically using various representations of the ternary numeral system It mainly illustrates a system of ternary propositional logic using the truth values false unknown and true and extends conventional Boolean connectives to a trivalent context Table 1 shows a truth table showing the logic operations for Kleene's logic Table 1 Truth table I T I 1 I I\\q PvqI  FF T F F T T FF iT T F T T 7 tx T u u u Z  S U j According to the Kleene's logic we propose a temporal relation table as follows Table 2 Temporal relation table p>tq q tp pI Pt-q T T T T F F F T F F F F T U U F U U U T U U F U   __L  __ lhe representation otT is true unknown Ii s talse and U is 3 Mining double association rules 3.1 Analyze and sort Given T T

 7. Conclusions  In this paper we have proposed an intelligent and efficient technique to reassess the distances between dynamic XML documents when one or all of the initially clustered documents have changed. After the changes, the initial clustering solution might become obsolete - the distances between clustered XML documents might have changed more or less depending on the degree of modifications \(insert update, delete\hich have been applied. Re-running full pair-wise comparisons on the entire set of modified documents is not a viable option, because of the large number of redundant operations involved Our proposed technique allows the user to reassess the pair-wise XML document distances, not by fully comparing each new pair of versions in the clustering solution, but by determining the effect of the temporal changes on the previously known distances between them. This approach is both time and I/O effective, as the number of operations involved in distance reassessing is greatly reduced  References  1  Beringer, J. and H\374llermeier, E., Online clustering of parallel data streams Data and Knowledge Engineering 58\(2\,  2006, 180-204 2  Catania, B. and Maddalena A., A Clustering Approach for XML Linked Documents, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22202\, IEEE 2002 3  Chen, M.S., Han, J. and Yu, P., Data Mining: An Overview from Database Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol. 8, 1996, 866-883 4  Cormen, T., Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R Introduction to algorithms, MIT Press, 1990 5  Costa, G., Manco, G., Ortale, R. and Tagarelli, A., A tree-based Approach to Clustering XML documents by Structure, PAKDD 2004, LNAI 3202, 137-148 Springer 2004 6  Dalamagas, T., Cheng, T., Winkel, K.J. and Sellis, T 2004, Clustering XML documents by Structure SETN 2004, LNAI 3025, 112-121, Springer 2004 7  Ester, M., Kriegel, H.P., Sander, J., Wimmer,M. and Xu, X., Incremental Clustering for Mining in a Data Warehousing Environment, Proc.of the 24 th VLDB Conference, New York, USA, 1998 8  Garofalakis, M., Rastogi, R., Seshadri, S.

5 Related Work There exists extensive previous work on both the mining of software repositories and on the use of clustering algorithms in software engineering This discussion focuses on the most similar and recent work in the area of software evolution Mining Software Repositories Our technique was partially inspired by the work of Zimmermann et al and Y ing et al 17 on the mining of association rules in change history As described in Section 1 we sought to expand the technique to be able to recommend larger but less precise clusters of elements to guide program navigation Bouktif et al also investigated how to recommend cochanges in software development As opposed to the work cited above Bouktif et al used change patterns instead of association rules Also their approach does not attempt to reconstruct transactions and can consider associated 002les that were changed in different transactions ChangeDistiller is a tool to classify changes in a transaction into 002ne-grained operations e.g addition of a method declaration and determines how strongly the change impacts other source code entities Our approach uses similar repository analysis techniques but is focused on providing task-related information as opposed to an overall assessment of a system's evolution Finally repository mining can also be used to detect aspects in the code In this conte xt aspects are recurring sets of changed elements that exhibit a regular structure Aspects differ from the clusters we detect in the regular structure they exhibit which may not necessarily align with the code that is investigated as part of change tasks Clustering Analysis The classical application of clustering for reverse engineering involves grouping software entities based on an analysis of various relations between pairs of entities of a given version of the system Despite its long and rich history  e xperimentation with this approach continues to this day For example Andreopoulos et al combined static and dynamic information K uhn et al used a te xtual similarity measure as the clustering relation and Christl et al used clustering to assist iterative semi-automated reverse engineering The main dif ferences b e tween most clusteringbased reverse engineering techniques and the subject of our investigation is that the entities we cluster are transactions rather than software entities in a single version of a system For this reason our analysis is based strictly on the evolving parts of the system Both Kothari et al and V an ya et al 15 recently reported on their use of clustering to study the evolution of software systems The idea of using change clusters is the same in both works and ours but the purpose of the work is different Kothari et al use change clusters to uncover the types of changes that happened e.g feature addition maintenance etc during the history of a software system Vanya et al use change clusters which they call evolutionary clusters to guide the partitioning of a system that would increase the likelihood that the parts of the system would evolve independently In contrast we cluster transactions based on overlapping elements not 002les to recommend clusters to support program navigation as opposed to architectural-level assessment of the system Finally Hassan and Holt evaluated on 002ve open source systems the performance of several methods to indicate elements that should be modi\002ed together This study found that using historical co-change information as opposed to using simple static analysis or code layout offered the best results in terms of recall and precision The authors then tried to improve the results using 002ltering heuristics and found that keeping only the most frequently cochanged entities yielded the best results As opposed to our approach the evaluated 002ltering heuristics were only applied on entities recovered using association rules and not using clustering techniques The focus of their study was also more speci\002c as they recommend program elements that were strictly changed  as opposed to recommending elements that might be inspected by developers 6 Conclusion Developers often need to discover code that has been navigated in the past We investigated to what extent we can bene\002t from change clusters to guide program navigation We de\002ned change clusters as groups of elements that were part of transactions or change sets that had elements in common Our analysis of close to 12 years of software change data for a total of seven different open-source systems revealed that less than 12 of the changes we studied could have bene\002ted from change clusters We conclude that further efforts should thus focus on maximizing the quality of the match between the current task and past transactions rather than 002nding many potential matches Our study has already helped us in this goal by providing reliable evidence of the effectiveness of some 002ltering heuristics and useful insights for the development of additional heuristics Acknowledgments The authors thank Emily Hill and Jos  e Correa for their advice on the statistical tests and the
