Introduction Data Mining, sometimes referred to as knowledge discovery from databases, is a non-trivial process of identifying implicit, valid, novel, potentially useful and ultimately understandable patterns in data. Data mining has been recognized by many researchers as a key research topic in database systems and machine learning and by many industrial companies as an important area with an opportunity of major revenues. The application of data mining is to improve the decision-making ability, find the abnormal pattern and predict the future trend base on the archived data. Data mining has already been widely used for commerce, finance, telecom and enterprise management in developed country. The researchers and engineers attempt to apply it in industrial monitoring and control process and achieve great success. McGreavy and Wang X Z use the KDD techniques to identify the status of the chemical industrial process in Britain [1]. Tony Ogilvie and B W Hogg put forward establishing the running and operating models in power plant by data mining techniques 2 As the development of electric industry, more and more real-time data are sent to database by DAS and DCS and large amounts of data are accumulated. Electric enterprise urgently needs to analyze the abundant history data in database to find the valuable knowledge hidden behind these data. The valuable knowledge and rules are found out from the history database to provide better decision support and make better adjustment guidance in the industry process. It is hard to find and summarize by traditional methods due to the mass of data, high dimension and strong coupling in electric industrial process. Data mining technique provides a novel and effective method to solve those difficulties. It can deal with mass of data and acquire useful knowledge and rules With the development of the industrial technology and the pressure of energy and environment pollution, electric utility industry is faced with great challenge in improving the efficiency and decreasing the pollution. It is meaning and worthy of researching to find the knowledge and modes from the history data to improve the performance in power systems. This paper proposes a new method to improve the electric process performance and efficiency by combining the data mining technique with operation optimization in 


the data mining technique with operation optimization in power plant 2. The basic structure of operation optimization based on data mining To keep the optimized operating status in electric industrial process two questions should be considered simultaneously: \(1 be controlled at high precision. \(2 values must be decided properly. Mostly the advanced control techniques are emphasized partially, while the optimization target values are ignored. The improvement of the performance by feedback control can  t exceed the condition decided by the target values. The optimization 0-7803-9091-1/05/$20.00  2005 IEEE 1642 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005 values reflect the reachable optimal parameters and state under currently load, which is the base of energy-loss and economical analysis. The decision of the optimization value is a very important question for operation optimization in power plant which is decided by considering accuracy real-time and feasibility [3]. Achieving the optimization value from history data by data mining technique is a novel and efficient method. It reflects the actual operating state and can be reached in practice From the angle of data mining, the industrial process data in electric production manifest stronger orderliness than the commercial process because the industrial process is less affected by uncertain factors. So we can design the artificial intelligence assistant system based on the results of data mining and make optimal option and decision by computer to guide the industrial process. The operation optimization basic structure based on data mining is shown in Figure. 1 Electric Industrial Process SIS database MIS databaseModel base Knowledge Base Data warehouse Data mining Data mining Share and transfer Data warehouse system Source data Data selection Data pre-processing Data transformation  Figure 1. The basic structure of the operation optimization based on data mining The architecture of operation optimization based on data mining includes three sub-parts: data warehouse, model base and knowledge base. The data warehouse is base for data mining and decision-making and it collects data from MIS and SIS database. The operation area is represented by several running models, which are attained by data preprocessing, characteristic pick-up and clustering analysis A set of different dynamic model is established and the reasoning rules are formed too. The real-time data are collected, preprocessing and condition identification According to the results of the condition identification and utilizing the knowledge and rules from data mining 


utilizing the knowledge and rules from data mining previously, the optimal model sets is attained and used to guide the operation. The MB and KB system store the algorithm and knowledge for advanced application that is found out by data mining. They have the self-study and self-organizing ability and works harmoniously. The operator and manager can add or modify the model and knowledge to extend and perfect the function for all kinds of advanced application 3.  Data mining algorithm The goal of association rules mining is to discover the important association among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of some other items. Agrawal and his co-workers proposed Apriori algorithms base on the concept of large itemsets to find association rules from transactions [4][5]. The mining process is decomposed into two phases. In the first phase candidate itemsets are generated and counted by scanning the transactions. If the number of an itemset appearing in the transactions is larger than a predefined threshold value called minimum support large itemset. Itemsets with only one item are first processed. The large itemsets with one item are then combined to form candidate itemsets of two items. This process is repeated until all large itemsets are found. In the second phase, the desired association rules are induced from the large itemsets found in the first phase. All the possible combination ways of association rules for each large itemset are formed, and the ones with their calculated confidence values larger than a predefined threshold \(called minimum confidence rules Apriori algorithm is used to mining boolean association rules. Quantitative association rule mining involves discretizing the domain of quantitative attributes into intervals. The values of quantitative attributes were mapped to a set of contiguous integers, then the algorithms for finding the boolean association rules can be used on the transformed database to discover quantitative association rules [6][7]. But distinct intervals will exclude those potential elements which are neighbouring the boundary. To solve this problem, the fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining process. The fuzzy concept is better than the partition method because fuzzy sets provide a smooth transition between member and non-member of a set. The use of fuzzy techniques makes the algorithms resilient to noise and missing values in the databases. So we propose the fuzzy association mining to decide the operation optimization value in electric industrial process 3.1.  Data selection and data transformation In general, the data mining process iterates through four basic steps: question definition, data selection and transformation, data mining, result interpretation and validation. The new algorithm and its improving are 1643 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005 emphasized excessively while the data preparation is often ignored. In fact the preparation and transformation of the data sets is a key step in the process of data mining In the process of deciding the optimization value, the data in stable running state are analyzed while the unit is in typical load. When the load is in a changing processing, the unit state is far from stable status. The performance index calculated from the process parameters can  t reflect the actual state of the unit. So we define that the state is stable when the load and other related parameters run stably over 5 minutes. Those data satisfied the conditions mentioned above are selected and transformed for data mining. The data are transformed into [0,100]. The formula is as follows    


   max  v i v i v i v i v i     1 where the minimum and maximum of v is calculated over a data aggregate or estimated by the domanial expert. These data are expressed in a form of &lt;x?l?u&gt; . For example, the load is express by &lt;Me?0?100&gt;, the excessive air coefficient is expressed by &lt; ?0?100&gt 3.2.  The calculation of coal consumption rate The economic operation of the unit is affected by many factors, for example the load, coal, equipment status and the operation level of the operators. In this paper the mainly controllable parameters related to the optimization operation in typical load are mined to find out the optimization value. The goal is to acquire the optimization value of the mainly controllable parameters and taking the minimization of the coal consumption rate as the target function. The heat efficiency is calculated according to the turbine power and the heat energy and the boiler efficiency is calculated by reverse-balance method. The coal consumption gb ? /g kW h? ?is calculated  as 0 1000 1 frt g bH b      i i =            \(2 where rtH  is the turbine heat efficiency is the boiler efficiency, %. 0?  is the pipeline heat preservation efficiency, assigned to be 99%. ?  is the electric consumption, %. gb  is the coal consumption g kW h? . The coal consumption gb  is the performance index to the operation optimization. The aim of data mining is to acquire the quantitative association rules between the parameter optimization values and the optimal economic index \(for example, the minimized coal consumption 3.3.  Fuzzy association mining algorithm In this paper the fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining for quantitative data in electric industrial. The proposed fuzzy mining algorithm first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set using membership functions. The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term on all the transaction data using the temporary set . The linguistic term with the maximum cardinality was used in later mining processes only, thus keeping the number of items the same as that of the original attributes. The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules [8][9]. The detailed mining algorithm is described as follows fC The Algorithm Input: A body of n transaction data, each with m attribute values, a set of membership functions, a predefined minimum support value and a predefined confidence value The p-th attribute in the j-th \(j=1, 2  n described by k membership functions is fuzzy set 1,2,...,j pp sR s k   1, 2 Output: A set of fuzzy association rules Step 1: Transform the quantitative value of each transaction  in D into a fuzzy set 1, 2

The excessive air coefficient value is taken when the unit is in 300MW stable load and the coal consumption is lower \(lower than 355g/kW.h history data. Then the data is standardized and is mined by fuzzy mining algorithm. The following rule is output: When the load is 100% and coal consumption eB  \(g/kW.h 37.50, 43.75], the excessive air coefficient  is [34.5 35.7], with a support value of 62% and a confidence of 81 It satisfies the requirement of minimum support and  Step 10: Output the rules with confidence value larger than or equal to the predefined minimum confidence After Step 10, the rules constructed are output and can act as the meta-knowledge for the given transaction. It is expressed based on reasoning and is easy to be understood 4.  The application of fuzzy data mining in operation optimization Based on the history data of a 300MW power plant unit, the typical parameters which are related to operation optimization are analyzed. Those parameters include load main steam pressure, main steam temperature, re-heated temperature, feed water temperature, exhaust gas temperature, excessive air coefficient and so on. The quantitative association rules are acquired by analyzing the history data. For example, load    1... nL L 1... nP P 1 1... mT T g gnB B related to low coal consumption are chosen as optimization values to optimal the electric industrial process. The rules to decide the optimal parameters values are expressed as 


to decide the optimal parameters values are expressed as 1 1   this way the optimal operation parameters are decided according to the load and the other related condition. The optimization values attained from data mining are reachable in operation and can reflect the actual status in operation According to the method mentioned above, the history data from recent three months are analyzed. A total of 4212 transactions consisted of the operation parameters of the typical stable load of 100%, 90% and 80% are obtained These transactions are standardized by formula \(1 minimum support value is set at 30% and the minimum confidence is set at 75%. The membership function of the parameters is shown in Figure 2 75 82 86 92686458  1 Low Middle High 0.5  Figure 2. The membership function 1645 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005 minimum confidence. This rule can be expressed as The corresponding range is This rule means that when the load is 300MW and the coal consumption is lower the optimal range of the excessive air coefficient is 1.342~1.350. The average of the interval can be adopted to decide the optimization point. The optimization value of excessive air coefficient 100 ,34.5,35.7eM ?&lt; &gt;?&lt 300 ,1.34eM MW ?&lt; &gt;?&lt gt gt;2,1.350 is set at 1.346 when the load is 300MW \(100 the method mentioned above, by utilizing the fuzzy association algorithm to mine the optimization value when the typical load of 100%, 90% and 75%, etc, a set of optimization values is obtained. The optimal values attained from the fuzzy data mining and the reference values attained in traditional way are listed in Table 1 300MW 16.67 Referenc Optimal Parameters Main steam temperature Reheat temperature Feed water temperature Flue gas temperature Excessive air coefficient Main Steam Pressure MPa 537 537 270.5 138.4 137.1 1.352 1.346 16.71 538.3 538.1

The performance of the boiler improved obviously. The average boiler efficiency improved about 0.924% and the coal consumption reduced about 3.72g/kW.h. The optimization value is close to the reference value in trend and can be used to guide the industry process. The newly founded rules and knowledge can be added to model base or the knowledge base. The operation optimization base on data mining is an effective method to improve the efficiency in power plant The execution times of fuzzy association mining in different minimum support with a computer Pentium 1.7G/256M are shown in Figure 3. For a total of about 4000 transactions in the data set and the minimum support is set at 20%, the execution time is about 150s. The fuzzy association mining is high efficiency. The execution time of fuzzy association mining increases linearly with the transactions in data set.

Conclusion The operation optimization is the mainly method to improve the performance in power plant and the decision of optimization value is the key point in operation optimization. In this paper, we proposed the operation optimization based on data mining and applied the fuzzy 


optimization based on data mining and applied the fuzzy association rules to find the optimization value from the history data of the equipments in power plant. The fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining process in order to soften the partition boundary of the domain and generalize and abstract the data. Base on the history data in power plant, the optimization values are reachable in operation and easy to guide operation. The rules mined out exhibit quantitative regularity in large database and can be used to provide guides and suggestions to the appropriate operator. Experimental results with the data in a 300MW power plant show that the algorithm base on fuzzy set operation performs very well and can be used to guide the operating process to achieve a good performance References 1] Wang X Z  Automatic classification for mining process operational data  Ind.

Simulations One has run simulations comparing the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm and the new algorithm here. A typical multisensor multitarget tracking environment is assumed in the simulations. According to article [1,3], One known that the performance of sequential MSJPDA is better than the performance of parallel MSJPDA. Therefore, the performance of parallel MSJPDA algorithm will not be compared here There are three sensors, which are fixed in three platforms. Regarding the 2nd sensor as fusion centre situation of the other sensors are: =?-500m?-500m 0m??N =?-500m? 500m?0m??The distance error of each sensor is: =300m, =200m, =100m?The bear error of each sensor is 0.03rad, =0.02rad, =0.01rad?The of sample is T=1s?The nonparametric model of clutter is used in the simulations, and expected number of false measurement is m=1.8 1 sN 3 s 1r 2 2r 3 3r 1 Simulations have been run for racking two targets. The true initialization state of the targets is X1?[-29500m,400m/s,34500m,-400m/s X ?[-26250m,296m/s,34500m,-400m/s]'? 2 The two targets will cross above 31seconds later. To evaluate tracking performance, 50 Monte Carlo runs were performed for three case of the target detection probability Pd=0.97 ? Pd=0.76 ? Pd=0.58. In every run, the total simulation time is 140 steps 


simulation time is 140 steps            Figure 1  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.97          Figure 2  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.97       Figure 3  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.76 567 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005         Figure 4  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.76         Figure 5  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.58          Figure 6  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.58  Table 1 The emanative times comparison for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm  Pd N A  0.97 0. 76 0.58 Sequential MSJPDA 2 11 17 SD-CMSJPDA 0 3 5 Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative 


Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative times, A denotes the kind of algorithm Table 1 shows the summation of emanative times for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm in 50 Monte Carlo simulations. From table 1 , it is shown that the stability of SD-CMSJPDA is better than that of sequential MSJPDA as the detection probability varied Figure 1,2 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0. 97, respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.76 respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.58, respectively. From the figures we can see that the average RMS position error is lower for the SD-CMS JPDA algorithm. We also see that the state estimation precision of sequential MSJPDA get worse as the detection probability decreases The reasons for these simulation results lies:1 state estimation precision will get worse when the detection probability decrease;2 algorithm is to process measurement from each sensor using single sensor JPDA algorithm sequentially. Therefore the estimation error from each sensor will be accumulated Moreover, the sequential MSJPDA algorithm can  t improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system The estimation error of the SD- CMSJPDA  algorithm will not be accumulated for it processes the measurement from each sensor directly in the mean time .What  s more the new method can greatly improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system. Therefore, the tracking performance of SD-CMSJPDA algorithm is better than that of sequential MSJPDA. Algorithm All of the simulations are run in the personal computer with a 2.0G CPU and a 256M memory. The average cost time per step is 0.0251 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. And the average cost time per step is 0.0282 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. According to the results we can see that there is few difference in real time between the new method and the sequential   MSJPDA when there is not so many sensors and targets 568 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  5. Conclusion In order to solve the problem of multisensor multi target tracking, a new centralized multisensor  joint probabilistic data association  algorithm is proposed in this paper. The simulation results shows that the tracking performance of the new algorithm is better than that of the sequential MSJPDA algorithm The computational complexity of the new method will increase as the number of sensors and targets grow Therefore, how to improve the real time of SD- CMSJPDA algorithm will be pay attention References 1] He You, Wang Guohong, Lu Dajin, Peng Yingning Multisensor Information Fusion With Application[M Publishion House of Electronics Industry. 2000, Beijing.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
