Taxi drivers’ decisions to make airport trips are one of the most important factors that maintain taxi demand and supply equilibrium at the airports. In this paper, a large taxi trip dataset is used to model New York City taxi drivers’ decision process in order to suggest policies for improving John F Kennedy \(JFK\ Airport ground access and passenger satisfaction. For this purpose, sequential taxi trips of drivers are identified, and the binary decision of “airport pick-up” or cruising for customers” at the end of each trip is modeled using logistic regression. The model provides an important tool which can be used to suggest and assess policy recommendations for improving taxi operations at JFK. Considering the increasing availability of taxi trip records in the world, the suggested methodology can also be applied elsewhere  Keywords—airport ground access; airport taxi operations decision model; big data; logistic regression  I  I NTRODUCTION  Airports serve as both national and international connection points for cities and provide economic benefits to the region around them  I t i s sho w n t h a t ac ce ssi b i l i t y m a y a ffe c t  travelers’ airport decision among competing airports in a region [2 Tax is  s h a r e of  air p or t t r av e l r a n g e s  betw een 6  u p  to 35% for major airports in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. In New York City \(NYC\, taxis carry 35% and 23% of all airport bound passengers to LaGuardia \(LGA\ and John F. Kennedy airports respectively [3   In t h es e res p e cts t a x i s  pl ay a v i tal  role in airport ground transportation in terms of accessibility to and from the city Taxicab industry is one of the heavily regulated businesses in the world. Taxi regulations for the airports in particular vary considerably from city to city. In some cities, any taxicab can drop-off passengers at the airport but not all taxis are allowed to pick-up airport passengers. This type of contract is called exclusive contract as opposed to the open system where any taxicab can drop-off or pick-up at the airport [4 5  T h e s e  taxi’s regulations can vary also for the different airports of the same city. Based on the attractiveness of airport pickups for drivers, some airports also charge a fee to support the airport operations [6  Th e  a ttr ac tiv e n ess of an ai rp o r t  t o  tax i d r iv ers  can depend on many factors including the airport passenger volume, distance to the city center, fare structure, and potential driver revenue outside of airport. As discussed in Santani et al 7 th e d e m a n d f o r tax i c a b  at  th e a i r p o r t an d at th e c ity af f e cts  each other. For example, it was found that during inclement weather, taxis make frequent short trips at Manhattan in NYC 8 T h i s i n cr ea se s  d r i v er  i n co m e a n d m a ke s fla t fa re for a n  airport pick-up, which otherwise is found satisfactory by the drivers, less attractive. As a result, taxi shortages are reported during inclement weather conditions at JFK airport in NYC 9 si t e c a s e i s  ob ser v ed a t  D a l l a s F o r t h-Wor t h Portland, and San Francisco airports where taxis mainly serve to the airport but they do not adequately serve the city [10  1 1   Examples of taxi supply excess [1 13  1 4 an d s h o r t a g e   10 11 16 1 7][1 4  r e g a rd l e ss  o f t h e co nt ra ct t y p e  c a n  be found around the world airports. Increasing the taxi supply can be discussed as a straightforward solution. However, any change in taxicab regulations is politically challenging due to multiple stakeholders, and more importantly increasing taxi supply does not guarantee better service or satisfaction  19  Due to varying taxi regulations among cities and airports the policies for improved taxi operations may not be transferable between airports, or such transfers may require regulation changes. In case a policy/regulation is considered there is lack of models to quantify the impacts. Understanding the existing taxi trip patterns can help create sound models and determine policies for improving the quality of airport ground access. In this sense, big urban datasets provide the opportunity to extract patterns of importance for use in planning and policy making. The aim of this paper is to model the taxi drivers airport pick-up decision for JFK airport using a comprehensive taxi trip data to identify the airport trips in the city. The decision model is used to suggest policies to overcome the taxi shortage within the existing regulations. For this purpose, first the consecutive taxi trips of the drivers are identified. For each passenger drop-off, the following trip origin is categorized as either JFK \(which implies an airport pickup\ based on GPS coordinates, or other non-airport, “regular” pickup. Then binary logistic regression is used to model the drivers’ decision to go to JFK for passenger pick-up and get a guaranteed flat fare, or keep on cruising in the city for a random fare. The model employs the drop-off location, time and date, weather conditions, drivers’ anticipated monetary gain with airport pick-up, and some other additional variables as the independent variables. Considering the higher market penetration of GPS devices in for-hire vehicles, and increasing availability of taxi GPS data around the world, the proposed methodology can be applied elsewhere The outline of the paper is as follows. First the literature review on taxicabs’ role in airport ground access is presented along with the specific taxi regulations in NYC and JFK Second, the details of data that was employed for the analysis followed by the discussion of which factors were included in 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 37

Desired low waiting times for passenger mostly imply excess taxi supply, which means low occupancy and low income for drivers. The demand at the airports and at the city are related The higher attractiveness of one compared to the other may result in excess or shortage of taxi supply at the airports Excess supply will benefit passengers with short waiting time however 56% and 19% of airport managers state the circling of taxis due to excess supply as a problem of some degree and a serious problem, respectively [1 O n  t h e  o t her ha n d 19 discuss that taxis have the highest passenger satisfaction mainly because of minimum taxi waiting time. Hence, taxi shortage resulting in high passenger waiting times may reduce the satisfaction/utilization of taxis and hurt airport’s competitiveness [1   The literature reports various operational and policy solutions for both cases. For Madrid Airport in Spain, with inadequate taxi supply, coordination of radio taxis are suggested [1 F o r  D a l l a s  Fo rt h-Wo r t h  i n c e n t i v e s for t a xi  drivers to divert the excess taxi service from airport to the city are recommended [10 O p pos ite t o  oth e r ex am ples in  Eu r o p e   taxi deregulation in Dublin was shown to reduce the taxi shortages at Dublin Airport without causing congregation [16 Meanwhile switching from the exclusive contract to the open system was not found to improve service quality at Honolulu International Airport in Hawaii [4 B a r r e t t  1 5] sugge st s  introducing pre-booked taxi services at airports to increase service quality.

JFK is served by NYC medallion taxicabs and drivers can make passenger pickups at any time at the airport. Private taxi  services \(black cars and livery cabs\annot pick-up passengers in the terminal taxi areas, although they can be prearranged by individual passengers for pickup in the general arrivals areas. The taxicab drivers are independent entities who can choose to operate in any given area in the city at any given time of the day. The 13,237 medallion taxicabs on an average make about 477,000 taxi trips per day in the city carrying between 680,000 and 895,000 passengers daily [8  F i v e pe r cen t of  th es e tr ips oc cu r  at the city airports and more than 85% of the trip origins and destinations are concentrated within the Manhattan borough 25  T h e  m e dall ion tax ic a b s  ar e on ly  pe rm itted to pick u p passengers who hail them on NYC streets while the other forhire car services utilize pre-arrangement. The taxi supply in the city is not constant and has been observed to vary depending upon the day of the week \(DoW\ and time of the day \(ToD 8   JFK airport is one of the busiest in the United States and is located in Queens, about 15 miles from midtown Manhattan At JFK, taxi passengers pay a flat rate \($45 + tolls\for trips to and from Manhattan and a metered fare to other destinations Reader should note that on September 2012, taxi fare structure in NYC was recently changed, charging $52 for ManhattanJFK and also increasing the per-mile rate. In the current paper the 2009 fare structure that was in effect for the collected data was used for the analysis Upon arriving at JFK, taxi drivers are first required to enter a Central Taxi Hold \(CTH\ where they have to wait before being dispatched to the terminals on a first-in-first-out \(FIFO basis. Data from the dispatch system at CTH shows that the daily taxi supply at JFK fluctuates considerably \(6,500-10,000 in the observed sample with reported average of 8,000-8,500 cabs/day [23 As d i s c usse d by B i gga r [24 a s a ge ner a l  r u l e  taxi fare structures should ensure that drivers are indifferent between customers such as having no incentives to refuse short journeys. In terms of JFK taxi operations, taxi drivers expect to earn the full Manhattan flat rate after waiting at CTH.  Since the NYC taxi regulations do not allow refusal of any customer short distance and low revenue trips may function as a disincentive to make an airport trip. In order to maintain the attractiveness of the airport pick-up, terminal dispatchers can issue “short return” tickets if the passengers’ destination is in 38 


Queens, Brooklyn or the Five Towns of Long Island. Drivers in possession of a valid “short-return” ticket enter an expedited shorter\ queue for prioritized dispatching if they return to JFK within ninety minutes. In a pilot taxi stand program in Queens the “short return ticket” was valued about $25 [25   D r iv er  interviews reveal the expected average waiting time to be between 45 to 90 minutes [2 A r e c e n t st u d y b y t h e a u t h or s  8  o n th e t a x i c a b  d r iv e r s i n co m e in  NYC sh o w s th at t h e  drivers seek to maintain their incomes around $20-$25 per hour. Combined with drivers waiting time expectation, it can be said that drivers value the short return ticket directly based on the time \(=revenue\hey save by having it  III  D ATA  Every medallion taxicab in New York City is mandated to install a GPS device and all taxi trips are recorded in a database. In this paper, one month sample of taxi GPS data provided by New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission TLC\ is used. The data includes all necessary fields such as pick-up/drop-off locations \(latitude and longitude\nd time stamps. The sample used in the current paper is the set of all taxi trips in April 2009, including 12.8 million taxi trips covering all time periods and days. In order to investigate the weather impacts, the weather conditions during each trip are also assigned by using the weather data gathered from the weather underground website. The weather data include information such as temperature, wind speed and direction precipitation, etc. The weather information is updated at an hourly interval unless there is any change in weather condition Since the current paper focuses on the taxi driver decision to make an airport trip after each drop-off, the weather conditions at the end of each trip is assigned as the weather condition that would affect the taxi driver’s next trip decision. Given the impacts of rain on taxi ridership  t h e c l ea r a nd rai n  categories are investigated in the current study. Weather underground website  categorizes the rain conditions as light rain, rain, and heavy rain based on the level of precipitation The weather conditions with no precipitation \(e.g. overcast partly cloudy\ are also assumed “clear”. Overall, the following categorization scheme is followed for the weather condition assignment for each trip   Existing Categories  Assigned Categories Clear Partly Cloudy Scattered Clouds Mostly Cloudy Overcast Fog Haze Clear Light Rain Light Freezing Rain Light Rain Rain Moderate Rain Heavy Rain Heavy Rain IV  TAXI  DRIVERS  AIRPORT  PICK-UP  DECISION  MODEL In the taxi trip data, there are two fields that allow us to identify trip sequences for the same taxi driver. The “shift number” field represents the “driver shift” which changes each time a different driver starts driving the taxi. For each shift number, the GPS data also has the “trip number” field. The trip number is equal to one for the first trip in a particular shift and increases by one for each consecutive trip. Thus, all the trips made by the same driver during her/his shift can be extracted sequentially. After each drop-off \(n th trip\, the taxi driver can either continue searching for a new customer, or go to the airport to seek a guaranteed fare. In other words, the decision for \(n+1 th trip is based on the characteristics/conditions following the drop-off of the n th trip. Hence, the decision variable is a binary variable and the probability of an airport pick-up decision can be estimated with binary logistic regression model. Below, the independent variables that are used in the decision model are discussed. While determining the set of independent variables, the authors also considered the informal taxi driver interviews during previous JFK Airport taxi operation studies [9   A  Time of Day, Day of Week, Weather Conditions Taxi drivers exhibit keen knowledge of the roadway traffic conditions \(including the roads connecting to the airport\ as well as the peak flight arrival times at the airport. They do not however, decide based on a single criterion, but based on a simultaneous assessment of both the traffic conditions and flight arrivals. For instance, the interviewed drivers independently  from each other – had a consensus that although there could be high number of flight arrivals during the morning hours, it is not reasonable to go to airport after a certain time as the roadways to and from JFK get highly congested. In this sense, ToD and DoW variables can successfully represent the coupled impacts of flight arrival schedules and traffic congestion patterns. It was also shown that taxi drivers generally make more money during inclement weather conditions [8  T h e we a t her co ndi t i o n s ha ve i n fl ue n c e on traffic congestion as well. To incorporate those variables into the decision model, the time/date and assigned weather condition at the end of each trip are used to extract the ToD DoW, and weather information. The following ToD categories were used   Early morning 5AM-7AM   AM peak 7AM-10AM   Off-peak 10AM-4PM   PM peak 4PM-7PM   Evening 7PM-12AM   Night 12AM-5AM Since the airport activity is minimal during “Night” period corresponding records were excluded from the decision model B  Expected Net Gain As discussed by [1  2 6 th e  p r of it ex p ect ati o n of a tax i  driver for picking up a customer from a particular zone affects her/his decision for search of customers. A real-life example would be the NYC taxi drivers’ choice of staying at Manhattan during inclement weather due to higher anticipated income Once a taxicab picks a passenger from the airport, she/he serves the airport as well as the passenger. Medallion taxicab drivers are not obliged to serve at any particular place for any particular time. Ignoring their service to the passengers, taxi drivers are somewhat like any customer looking \(cruising\ for the most competitive price \(higher anticipated fare\ at the most attractive store \(most lucrative locations\. In this respect, JFK 39 


provides a satisfactory fare for drivers however it is offset by the waiting at the CTH  A driver’s gain is suggested to be defined as the profit per unit time to include both occupied and vacant taxi times [26   For JFK case, although $45 flat fare to Manhattan is stated as a satisfactory amount by drivers, they have to wait at the CTH before being dispatched to the airport terminals. The average wait time at the CTH varies depending on the time of day as shown in Fig. 1.  Maximum waiting times of up to 148 minutes have been observed in the dataset with the maximum average waiting times observed during 3-5 AM  and 9-11 AM \(~ 120 minutes  Fig. 1 Average waiting times at JFK CTH by time of day Instead of waiting at CTH, drivers could make money elsewhere in the city, hence choosing JFK Airport introduces an opportunity cost for drivers. To take this opportunity cost into account, net gains of drivers \(as a function of ToD, DoW and weather\ are calculated as    The average hourly driver incomes for different DoW, ToD and weather conditions are extracted from the data similar to Kamga et al. [8  In  o r d e r t o  cal c u lat e av e r ag e w aitin g tim es   the taxi trips that have the consecutive drop-off and pick-up points at JFK are extracted from the data. The time in between the last drop-off and the pick-up is assigned as the waiting time for that particular DoW-ToD period. Overall, the net gain represents the revenue \(or loss\ of a driver for making a trip to the airport to pick-up passengers instead of cruising elsewhere for passengers. As explained previously, drivers with short return ticket can skip the CTH waiting queue. They are supposedly dispatched to the terminals shortly after other taxis already waiting in the short return queue. Since the short return ticket holders can return to the airport at any time before 90 minutes, their waiting times cannot be calculated. In this sense 10 minutes of waiting time is assumed for all short return trips C  Location The majority of the taxi trips in NYC are confined to Manhattan. The relatively distant location of JFK to Manhattan is also one of the reasons why drivers prefer to stay at Manhattan. On the other hand, once the drivers pick-up passengers to drop-off at Brooklyn or Queens, they are closer to JFK and can be more likely to go to the airport. Of course going to JFK with a passenger is the best case as they get a relative good fare to go to the airport and they can \(if they chose to join the queue at CTH\et the same relative good fare on the way back to Manhattan. In order to quantify the impact of location on driver decision, the latitude and longitude of the drop-off point is used to extract the location where driver makes her/his decision regarding the next pick-up. Each dropoff location is categorized as one as shown below   JFK   Manhattan   Brooklyn   Queens   Bronx   Home/Shift Change   Other  Please note that although JFK is actually in Queens, the JFK has been assigned a location category to account for the impact of very close airport proximity. The explanation regarding the Home/Shift Change is provided below. The location category “Other” includes all the trips to New Jersey Staten Island, and further destination points. Since the “Other category has relatively very few trips, corresponding records was excluded from the decision model  D  First Trip As discussed previously, the decision at \(n+1 th trip is based on the n th trip characteristics. Thus, there is no decision to make after the last trip in a shift as the driver ends her/his shift after the last drop-off. On the other hand, taxi drivers who live relatively close to the airport, or who start their shift at locations close to the airport may prefer to earn a high airport fare in their first trip [9  I t i s cr uc i a l  t o unde r s t a nd t h e d r i v e r  decision regarding their first pick-up location. In our onemonth sample 8.5% of the first trips are pick-up at the airport which correspond to 49.8% of the airport pick-ups are the first trips in corresponding shifts. The taxi GPS dataset only includes paid/occupied trips with a customer. Hence, the vacant trips between shift change and first pick-up are not recorded. In order to investigate taxi drivers’ first pick-up decision, a vacant “pseudo” trip is created for each first trip in a shift. Pesudo-trips are assumed to have no short return ticket Considering that vacant trips occur  - presumably - shortly before the first trip in a shift, DoW, ToD and weather conditions corresponding to the first trip pick-up time are assigned also for the vacant trip. Main issue arises with the location” variable as there is no way of knowing exactly where the driver started her/his shift. A New York City Department of Transportation study suggests that many drivers change shifts at Brooklyn or Queens around 4PM causing a temporary taxi shortage in Manhattan [27  Mean w h ile, it is  also reported that drivers can individually arrange to change shifts in Manhattan as well. To overcome this concern Home/Shift change” location category is defined only for vacant pseudo trips E  Short Return Ticket Short return ticket is an important incentive that helps maintain the airport attractiveness. Drivers with short return ticket are more likely to return to the airport and make up for their income loss due to the previous short trip [9 I n o r d e r to  incorporate the effect of short return ticket, each airport pick0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0-1 AM 1-2 AM 2-3 AM 3-4 AM 4-5 AM 5-6 AM 6-7 AM 7-8 AM 8-9 AM 9-10 AM 10-11  11-12  12-1 PM 1-2 PM 2-3 PM 3-4 PM 4-5 PM 5-6 PM 6-7 PM 7-8 PM 8-9 PM 9-10 PM 10-11  11-12  CTH Wait Times Min Average CTH Waiting times 40 


up decision after a trip that has the origin at the airport and destination at Brooklyn or Queens is assumed to have a short return ticket Regarding the above independent variables, choice of airport pick-up or regular street pick-up is modeled using binary logistic regression. The decision model results are presented below V  MODEL  RESULTS The logistic regression is carried out using SPSS. The model significance and parameters in the model are presented below TABLE I Model Summary 2 Log likelihood Cox & Snell R Square Nagelkerke R Square 1108764.730 a  036 311  For logistic regression regular R-square values cannot be defined and calculated.

The Nagelkerke R-square of 0.311 value for the presented model suggests a moderate fit. Another measure of goodness-of-fit often used to evaluate a logistic regression model is performed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic \(ROC\rve \(Fig. 2\OC curve is based on comparisons of “true positive” \(sensitivity and “true negative” \(specificity\ predictions of the logistic regression.

Logistic regression is based on a transformation of a linear probability model to remove range restrictions, and this transformation requires a different interpretation of the regression coefficients. Let the probability be a linear function of covariates, e.g where is the vector of covariates and is a vector of regression coefficients. In order to restrict the probability to [0 terv al f i rs t odds ratio is  introduced  Then logit transformation is carried out     Hence, the probability range of [0, 1 is assu red  L o g i stic reg r es sio n is carried out by establishing  where is the probability of the binary outcome is the vector of covariates and is a vector of regression coefficients. In this respect, individual coefficients estimate the change in the log odds for a unit change in Hence, the coefficients e logit coefficients and cannot be directly interpreted regarding their impacts on the outcome. Since   the odds ratio  provides the necessary measure in logistic regression to assess the impact of unit change of a parameter in on the probability of the decision outcome The odds ratios confirm the JFK officials’ claim that drivers go to airport less during rain conditions. Similarly drivers dropping passengers at the Bronx are found to be almost 7 times more likely to make an airport trip compared to a Manhattan drop-off. As expected, a JFK drop-off followed with a JFK pick-up has the highest odd ratio. Meanwhile, the results also confirm that drivers are more likely to go to JFK Airport for their first pick-up in their shifts.  Although the shift change locations reside in one of the NYC boroughs, the odds ratio for the shift change location is the second highest \(48.7 after JFK Positive impacts of short return tickets were recognized by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey \(PANYNJ and similar “short-return ticket” policy has also been implemented at the LGA airport. More, the short return time was recently expanded from 90 minutes to two hours at both the airports to provide more fare opportunities to the drivers 28   N e v e r t h e l e s s  th e p r es en t e d  m ode l qu an tif i e s th e im pact   The drivers with a short return ticket are 20 to 27 times more likely to go to the airport after their drop-off at Queens and Brooklyn. ToD and DoW are also found to be significant and to have an impact on airport pick-up probability. DoW impact is relatively smaller than ToD One interesting finding is the impact of “net gain”. One might expect that increasing the fare \(hence the net gain would have a high impact on drivers decision. However, net gain has the lowest impact among all the significant parameters. This finding implies that fare increase for airport trips may not provide the desired increase in taxi supply at JFK. On one hand, a theoretical explanation to this low impact could be the computation of hourly driver revenues. The hourly revenues are calculated based on ToD, DoW, weather conditions, and CTH waiting time. In other words, “net gain parameter is highly correlated with other significant factors in the model, and may provide redundant information. On the other hand, drivers already assess the JFK flat fare as very satisfactory based on authors’ interviews with the drivers during previous studies [2  8  T h e d r i v er s m a j o r c o n c erns in JFK taxi operations are not the fare amounts but the inefficiencies in dispatching, traffic congestion from/to Manhattan and so on. In this respect, the lower impact of an increase in already appreciated taxi fare may imply the presented model’s realism regarding drivers’ decision process Meanwhile, the range of possible policies is relatively limited as the model variables can not necessarily be adjusted i.e. DoW, ToD, weather. The odds ratio implies that a driver making a drop-off at Queens or Brooklyn is 15 to 21 times more likely to go to the airport for pick-up. However, such trips out of Manhattan do not take place unless a customer’s destination is not in Queens or Brooklyn. An intuitive regulation/policy solution of increasing fare is found to have negligible effect. The only model variables that can be used directly \(without a regulation change\ to suggest a policy is the short return ticket. The model results, on the other hand, allow us to identify the periods that taxi drivers would be the least likely to pick-up passengers from airports. Some additional policies can be proposed based on findings and the literature however the implementation of such policies would require approval from multiple stakeholders VI  SUGGESTED  POLICIES A  Airport Pick-up “Punch-card As discussed above, drivers with a short return ticket are 20 to 27 times more likely to go to the airport after their drop-off at Queens and Brooklyn. However, short return tickets are only issued once a driver picks up a passenger who goes to destinations designated as short return eligible, i.e. Brooklyn Queens. The data includes almost 21,000 short return eligible trips. The data also shows that 809,242 trips \(6.4% of all taxi trips\ have destinations in Brooklyn or Queens. Hence, given an incentive like short return ticket, the drivers picking up passengers at any location and dropping them off at Brooklyn and Queens could go to JFK and help relieve the taxi shortage Such an incentive has a high potential to attract drivers from Manhattan as well, however the impact cannot be quantified with the existing data A possible way to introduce an incentive is to let drivers skip the CTH waiting area and join the priority queue \(just like the short return ticket holders\ after they make certain number of airport pick-ups. This is very similar to punch-cards in coffee shops in which you get a free coffee after a predefined number of purchases, or airline reward programs in which you have a free flight after you reach certain miles-traveled. In this way, all the drivers will have the fair access to the reward and not only they will be more likely to go to the airport with their priority-queue” punch cards, they may also be more likely to go to the airport to get their cards punched. Punch cards can be printed, but better, they can also be virtual punch cards as offered for smart phones and used in many commercial industries. More, the PANYNJ has been in the process of testing a camera technology for plate recognition at the CTH at JFK [9  Su ch c a m e ra s y s t em s c a n als o  be u s e d t o  de te rm in e the number of trips made by a taxicab, however as a single taxi is used by multiple drivers, this can cause issues on which driver should benefit from the reward. Meanwhile, the taxi 42 


shortages are not experienced at all times, hence the use of priority-queue punch reward can be allowed for time periods that taxis are needed the most. Overall, implementation of an airport pick-up reward program is relatively easy to implement and provides a flexible way to improve airport attractiveness  B  Guidelines and Advanced Technologies for Efficient Dispatching Short return tickets’ attractiveness is solely based on the time they help save time for the drivers. In this respect, any policy with the same time-saving target would increase the drivers’ airport pick-up probability. The average hourly driver income is around $20 H e n c e sa vi ng 15 m i nut e s be fore be dispatched to a terminal is equal to more than $5 \(~20% of average hourly revenue\or a driver. As discussed in Kamga et al. [23  th er e  a r e  in ef f i c i en ci es  in dis p at ch in g at J F K  as  t h e  dispatchers are overwhelmed with multiple tasks simultaneously. For instance, the drivers complain about waiting at the terminals up to 20 minutes due to early dispatching. Some of these inefficiencies can be alleviated by standardizing the dispatching process based on guidelines Kamga et al. [6 r v e y s t h e a i rpor t di spa t c h i ng t e c hnol o g i e s  which also possess high potential to help dispatchers and increase the efficiency. The findings in the current paper shows that such advanced technologies should not be considered only as assistance for dispatchers, but also as an investment that increases the attractiveness of the airport for taxis, with long term impacts to increase passenger satisfaction and competitiveness of the airport. Such technology improvements require capital investment which needs to be justified in term of their benefits. The models similar to the one in the current paper may help to quantify the benefits with respect to the airport accessibility and attractiveness for taxis The use of the presented model goes beyond the policies derived directly from the model results. The model can aid to assess the impacts of other policy considerations. For instance separate for-hire-vehicle agreement for taxi shortage periods is a possible \(yet legally very complicated in NYC\stion Since the model includes the time of day impact on taxi drivers’ airport pick-up decision, the periods that are suitable for such separate agreements can be identified. Taxis do not only serve as an airport ground access mode, but also help maintaining accessibility in metropolitan cities. As the taxi supply at a certain location is strongly related to taxi drivers decision to cruise around that particular area, a meaningful decision model can help determine ways to increase transportation accessibility VII  CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a big taxi trip dataset was used to model New York City taxi drivers’ decision process in order to suggest policies for improving John F. Kennedy \(JFK\ Airport ground access and passenger satisfaction. For this purpose, sequential taxi trips of drivers were identified, and the “airport pick-up or “cruising for customers” binary decision at the end of each trip was modeled using logistic regression. The developed model results confirmed several issues that were mentioned by taxi industry stakeholders based on their experiences. For instance, the results not only confirmed but also quantified the negative impact of rain on taxi supply at JFK. Similarly, the positive impact of short return ticket policy was confirmed and quantified by the model results. Based on these promising findings, policies were suggested to address the taxi shortage problem at JFK airport Taxi drivers’ decisions to make airport trips are one of the most important factors that maintain taxi demand and supply equilibrium at the airports. In this respect the current paper suggests a methodology to capture the drivers’ decision mechanism. The decision model can be further used to evaluate the impacts of multiple policy recommendations. Considering the higher availability of similar taxi trip datasets, the methodology can be applied elsewhere as well R EFERENCES  1  Chmura Economics&Analytics, “The economic impact of Richmond International Airport” Tehnical Report Prepared for Capital Region Airport Commission, Richmond International Airport, VA, 2008 2  M.C.

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 sub”ows and can also handle short ows with ef“cient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer sub”ows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large bene“ts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have suf“cient traf“c and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple re“nement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modi“ed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satis“ed 1 It doesnt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satis“ed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted traf“c through this path for the particular destination pre“x for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butter”y 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jelly“sh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance traf“c Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jelly“sh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple sub”ows and modulating how much data is sent over different sub”ows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by sub”ows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to ef“ciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet traf“c splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Traf“c engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic traf“c changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related traf“c engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy traf“c demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insuf“cient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of traf“c onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load
