Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu P.R. China 610031   Abstract  Mining the frequent item sets is the core of algorithm for mining association rules. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of discovering the frequent item sets is a key issue in data mining area. In this paper, an algorithm for acquiring the frequent item sets, which is based on the set operations of item-transaction list, is put forward. It turns out to cost less in terms of both space and time Moreover, it is applied to get the scheme modifying association rules in the intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident, and it proves effective  1. Introduction  As the most important and popular one of datamining methods, association rule method was firstly put forward by Agrawal R in 1993  R.Agrawal used the Apriori algorithm to mine the association rules. Apriori algorithm involves two steps: first, it finds the frequent item sets with the support degree being more than the threshold; second, it generates the association rules based on the frequent item sets. Apriori algorithm is Antimonotone, i.e. if an item sets is not a frequent item sets then its supper sets are all not frequent item sets, thus the  k 1\didates can be generated based on the k  frequent item sets, which narrows down the search range of algorithm The Apriori algorithm has the following limitations 1\The time of scanning the database is equal to the length of max frequent item sets. So, if there are some long frequent item sets, it would take a long time 2\didates may be generated. If the number of frequent item sets with the length being 1 is more than 10000, the number of frequent item sets with the length being 2 will be more than 10MB 3\he infrequent but important information can not be taken into account. Due to the minimization support degree, the transactions with low support degree can not be involved. Similarly, if the minimization support degree is set to be very low, the efficiency of the algorithm would be poor, and many irrelevant item sets may be generated 000\021 000\003 0000 any candidates and timely scanning database are the bottlenecks of Apriori algorithm, focus on these limitations, many researchers do much work to improve the algorithm, and many extended algorithms were advanced, such as AprioriTid algorithm presented in referen r u n i ng al g o rithm pres en ted i n ref e re n c e   h table tech n i q u e pres en ted in ref e re n ce [4 Partition based association rules mining algorithm presented in referen a m p li n g alg o rit h m pres e n ted  in referen d th e DIC  D y n a m i c Ite m s e t C oun ti ng   presented in referen 000\003 Different from the extended algorithms, there are other algorithms based on different theories and data expression for discovering association rule. The Tree Projection algorithm  takes the Lexicographic tree as the frame of data store. With the strategy of depth first, the database transactions can be projected and counted in the tree, with a matrix, the frequency of item sets is calculated lastly. Therefore, it is speedier than the Apriori algorithm The FP-growth algorithm, put forward by Han in referen a ty pe of f r equ e nt pattern  m i n i n g  m e th od  based on frequent pattern tree\(FP-tree\ompared with the Apriori algorithm, it has these following properties 1\ing the FP-tree to store the key information of database, it scans the database for only two times, so more I/O time for scanning database can be saved. \(2\he candidate needs not to be generated, so more time for generating and testing candidate can be saved.\(3\th the strategy of dividing and ruling, the search range can be narrowed down  The algorithm based on Diffset   brought forth by Zaki, only keeps the difference between the candidate pattern and the existing frequent pattern, so it reduces much storage place, especially for the denseness data Different from the above algorithms, a method based on the set Operations of item-transaction list is put forward to get the frequent item sets. In the intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident this method is applied to the scheme modifying transaction, thus the frequent items set for association rules is gained  2.

4. An example  Scientific traffic management entails the identification & compensation for road traffic accident, in which the technical examination of vehicles in accident plays a pivotal role. Through the technical examination we can get a general picture of how the vehicle acts in the traffic accident, thus objectively analyzing the reasons behind the accident so as to identify the partyís liability Nowadays vehicles are numerous, and the number of road traffic accidents is on the rise, which calls for more experts as well as more scientific examinations indeed For technical examination to be more efficient, an intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident is developed, in which the CBR method is applied to chose the scheme of the most similar one as the scheme of the new problem from the history case, then the scheme modifying association rules is applied to help decision maker modify the scheme of the new problem and more importantly, the algorithms based on the set operations of item-transaction list is applied to get the scheme modifying association rules The schemeís structure in the system is showed in table 1, from which we can see that a scheme is composed of some examination items, and to modify the scheme means to delete or add some examination items from it  Table 1 The schemeís structure Field name Field type Field length Remark jddbh Char 18 Scheme number jdxmbh Char 10 Item number jdxmmc Char 24 Item number jdbz Char 100 Standard jdjg Char 20 Result  Let     2 1 m i i i I  be the set of all examination items, and   2  1   m j i j  be an item of     2 1 m i i i I  Let         2 1 m i Add i Add i Add T         2 1 m i Del i Del i Del  be the set of all modification actions, here   l i Add  means adding examination item l i and   j i Del means deleting examination item j i Let     1 2 1 1 n i i i P   be the former scheme and     2 2 1 2 n i i i P  be the final scheme. Supposing 1 I be the set of items deleted and we can get 2 1 1 P P I   supposing 2 I be the set of items added, and we can get 1 2 2 P P I   so a modifying transaction can be           2 1 I i i add I i i del T j j l l     In this way, the system collects all the modifying transactions that decision maker made, and the part of transactions set is showed in table 2. We transform table 2 into item-transaction set, which is showed in table 3. By setting the support degree as 0.2, we apply the algorithms based on the set operations of item-transaction list and gain the final frequent item sets, which are showed in table 4  Table2 transactions list Transacti on number Modifying operations list T100 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.2 Del\(A3.2 T200 Add\(A1.2 Del\(A1.3 T300 Add\(A1.2 Add\(A1.3 T400 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.2 Del\(A1.3 T500 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.3 T600 Add\(A1.2 Add\(A1.3 T700 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.3 T800 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.2 Add\(A1.3 Del\(A3.2 T900 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.2 Add\(A1.3  Table3 The item-transaction set Modifying operation Transactions list Add\(A1.1\ T100,T400,T500,T70 0,T800,T900 Add\(A1.2\ T100,T200,T300,T40 0,T600,T800,T900 Add\(A1.3\ T300,T500,T600,T70 0,T800,T900 Del\(A1.3\ T200,T400 Del\(A3.2\ T100,T800  Table 4 The final frequent item sets K Frequent item sets Transactions list 1 Add\(A1.1 T100,T400,T500,T700,T800,T900 1 Add\(A1.2 T100,T200,T300,T400,T600,T800,T90 0 1 Add\(A1.3 T300,T500,T600,T700,T800,T900 1 Del\(A1.3 T200,T400 1 Del\(A3.2 T100,T800 2 Add\(A1.1\,A dd\(A1.2 T100 T800 T900 2 Add\(A1.1\,A dd\(A1.3 T500 T700 T800 T900 2 Add\(A1.1\,De l\(A3.2 T100 T800 2 Add\(A1.2\,A dd\(A1.3 T600 T800 T900 2 Add\(A1.2\,De l\(A1.3 T100 T800 2 Add\(A1.2\,De l\(A3.2 T100 T800

Conclusion  Frequent item sets acquisition based on the set operations of item-transaction list transforms the transactions list into item-transaction list. By doing some set operations on this list, the final frequent item sets is gotten. The analysis of algorithm shows that it is simple and costs little in space & time. Also , the actual application proves it is easy and worthy to be programmed. Moreover, the final results gotten by the algorithm not only include the frequent number and frequent items but also the transactions list corresponding to the frequent item sets, which can be applied to study whether the association rules are ordinary rules or individual rules, and it would be our future task  Acknowledgements  This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of P.R.

The KDD Cup 99 dataset includes a set of 41 features derived from each connection and a label which speci  es the status of connection records as either normal or speci  c attack type. These features had all forms of continuous, discrete, and symbolic with signi  cantly varying ranges falling in four categories[17 KDD d a taset is d i v i d e d in to tr ain i n g  and testing record sets. Total number of connection records in the training dataset is about 5 million records. This is too large for our purpose; as such only concise training dataset of KDD, known as 10 training dataset, was employed here In computer simulation, we have to consider the following assumption: population size N pop 100 replacement percentage P rep 20%. Crossover rate P c 80%, Mutation rate P m 5%, Termination condition Maximum generation=100\Table 1 compare the different algorithm performances, just as shown in Table 1, the total performance of our algorithm is better than other algorithm Table 1.

Conclusions  In this work, a genetic fuzzy rule-based classifier has been designed by using fuzzy rule iterative learning algorithm in instruction detection system. To reduce the search space of fuzzy rule candidate, the population is initialized with the individuals randomly chosen among the pre-screened rules. The pre-screening process is completed by the usage of support and confidence.

Time Complexity and Speed We now evaluate scalability and speed with large high dimensional data sets to only compute the models as shown in Figure 7 The plotted times include the time to store models on disk but exclude the time to mine frequent itemsets We experimentally prove 1 Time complexity to compute models is linear on data set size 2 Sparse vector and matrix computations yield efﬁcient algorithms whose accuracy was studied before 3 Dimensionality has minimal impact on speed assuming average transaction size T is small Transactions are clu stered with Incremental Kmeans 26 introduced on Sectio n 3 Large transaction les were created with the IBM synthetic data generator 3 ha ving defaults n 1 M T=10 I=4 Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute the clustering model The rst plot on the left shows time growth to build the clustering with a data set with one million records T10I4D1M As can be seen times grow linearly as n increases highlighting the algorithms efﬁciency On the other hand notice d has marginal impact on time when it is increased 10-fold on both models due to optimized sparse matrix computations The second plot on the right in Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute clustering models increasing k on T10I4D100k Remember k is the main parameter to control support estimation accuracy In a similar manner to the previous experiments times are plotted for two high dimensionalities d  100 and d 1  000 As can be seen time complexity is linear on k  whereas time is practically independent from d  Therefore our methods are competitive both on accuracy and time performance 4.5 Summary The clustering model provides several advantages It is a descriptive model of the data set It enables support estimation and it can be processed in main memory It requires the user to specify the number of clusters as main input parameter but it does not require support thresholds More importantly clusters can help discovering long itemsets appearing at very low support levels We now discuss accuracy In general the number of clusters is the most important model characteristic to improve accuracy A higher number of clusters generally produces tighter bounds and therefore more accurate support estimations The clustering model quality has a direct relationship to support estimation error We introduced a parameter to improve accuracy wh en mining frequent itemsets from the model this parameter eliminate spurious itemsets unlikely to be frequent The clustering model is reasonably accurate on a wide spectrum of support values but accuracy decreases as support decreases We conclude with a summary on time complexity and efﬁciency When the clustering model is available it is a signiﬁcantly faster mechanis m than the A-priori algorithm to search for frequent itemsets Decreasing support impacts performance due to the rapid co mbinatorial growth on the number of itemsets In general the clustering model is much smaller than a large data set O  dk  O  dn  A clustering model can be computed in linear time with respect to data set size In typical transaction data sets dimensionality has marginal impact on time 5 Related Work There is a lot of research work on scalable clustering 1 30 28 a nd ef  c i e nt as s o ci at i o n m i n i n g 24  1 6  40  but little has been done nding relations hips between association rules and other data mining

constrained frequent itemset search are NP-hard and they are at least P-hard meaning t hey will remain intractable even if P=NP This work gives evidence it is not a good idea to mine all frequent

the sense that each cluster can be used to derive all subsets from a maximal itemset The model represents an approximate cover for all potential associations We now discuss closely related work on establishing relationships between association rules and other data mining techniques Preliminary results on using clusters to get lower and upper bounds for support is given in 27  I n g eneral there is a tradeoff between rules with high support and rules with high conﬁdence 33 t h i s w o rk propos es an al gorithm that mines the best rules under a Bayesian model There has been work on clustering

than transactions once they are mined is analyzed in 22  T he out put is a summary of association rules The approach is different from ours since this proposal works with the original data set whereas ours produces a model of the data set In 42 the idea of mining frequent itemsets with error tolerance is introduced This approach is related to ours since the error is somewhat similar to the bounds we propose Their algorithm can be used as a means to cluster transactions or perform estimation of query selectivity In 39 t he aut hors explore the idea of building approximate models for associations to see how they change over time 6 Conclusions This article proposed to use clusters on binary data sets to bound and estimate association rule support and conﬁdence The sufﬁcient statistics for clustering binary data are simpler than those required for numeric data sets and consist only of the sum of binary points transactions Each cluster represents a long itemset from which shorter itemsets can be easily derived The clustering model on high dimensional binary data sets is computed with efﬁcient operations on sparse matrices skipping zeroes We rst presented lower and upper bounds on support whose average estimates actual support Model-based support metrics obey the well-known downward closure property Experiments measured accuracy focusing on relative error in support estimations and efﬁciency with real and synthetic data sets A clustering model is accurate to estimate support when using a sufﬁciently high number of clusters When the number of clusters increases accuracy increases On the other hand as the minimum support threshold decreases accuracy also decreases but at a different rate depending on the data set The error on support estimation slowly increases as itemset length increases The model is fairly accurate to discover a large set of frequent itemsets at multiple support levels Clustering is faster than A-priori to mine frequent itemsets without considering the time to compute the model Adding the time to compute the model clustering is slower than Apriori at high support levels but faster at low support levels The clustering model can be built in linear time on data size Sparse matrix operations enable fast computation with high dimensional transaction data sets There exist important research issues We want to analytically understand the relationship between the clustering model and the error on support estimation We need to determine an optimal number of clusters given a maximum error level Correlation analysis and PCA represent a next step after the clustering model but the challenges are updating much larger matrices and dealing with numerical issues We plan to incorporate constraints based on domain knowledge into the search process Our algorithm can be optimized to discover and periodically refresh a set of association rules on streaming data sets References 1 C  A ggar w al and P  Y u F
