Using Data Mining to Accelerate Cross-Selling Hewen Tang     Zengfang Yang     Pingzhen Zhang    Honglin Yan  School of Information Technology and Engineering Yuxi Normal University Yuxi, Yunnan Province, China thw@yxtc.net,  yzf@yxtc.net,  zpz@yxtc.net,  y_fox@yxtc.net Abstract Data mining is often used to discover hidden knowledge of large datasets, which is widely used in bussiness Cross-selling is very important in marketing and which is the practice of suggesting related products or services to a customer who is considering buying something. Data mining can accelerate cross-selling through finding the related 
products or services. In this paper, we mainly propose a method of data mining in Excel with an add-in of XLMiner to accelerate cross-selling. It does not need much speciality knowledge of data mining but only some parameter setting Additionally, almost everyone can use Excel skilled. Therefore the proposed method, which is based on Excel, can be mastered by general selling people easily. This paper also present an example through mining association rules  Keywords ó data mining; association rule; CRM; marketing cross-selling I  I NTRODUCTION  This section presents some background information 
about cross-selling, data mining and association rule, Excel and XLMiner A  Cross-Selling Cross-selling is an important sales technique of marketing and defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as the action or practice of selling among or between established clients, markets, traders, etc." or "that of selling an additional product or service to an existing customer 1  There are many businesses definition in many different ways. Simply, cross-selling is offering a similar product to what a shopper is looking at -- either an alternative model or accessories that go with the product. It is designed to widen 
the customer's reliance on the company and decrease the likelihood of the customer switching to a competitor Using a cross-selling strategy is likely to result in 1\ustomers finding exactly what they are looking for thus increasing the rate of order completion, and/or 2\ustomers adding accessories to their original selection, thus increasing the order total Cross-selling is very useful to boost sales. Businesses that offer more than one product or service often use the cross-selling technique for marketing. For example, selling a color-coordinated tie and a shirt to go along with a selected suit , successful bankers always look for opportunities to sell 
credit cards, insurance, and mutual fund products to their existing account holders Cross-selling is also very common with in-bound telemarketing calls. It should be done in a pleasant way and never pressed, though it may simply sound like a temptation for impulse buying, cross-selling offers legitimate added benefits to shoppers B  Data mining and Association rule Explosive growth in data and databases has generated an urgent need for new techniques and tools that can intelligently and automatically turn the processed data into useful information and knowledge. Data mining has 
consequently emerged and become a research area with increasing importance 2  Data mining is the analysis of \(often large\ observational data sets to find unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data owner 3 It plays a vital role in business expansion. By knowing customer behavior based on past records, increased profits from cross-selling and other business strategies can be achieved 4 Data mining have many alias, such as knowledge discovery in database\(KDD pattern discovery, Knowledge extracting, data dredging, data 
archeology and so on 5  Data mining owns many technique and we only take association rules as example here. Association rules  is pioneer of data mining and one of the most active point of data mining 6 It shows attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. A typical and widelyused example of association rule mining is market basket analysis Association rule is defined as statements in the form of if-thenî, of which ìifî part and ìthenî part are called antecedent and consequent respectively. For example, if buy milk then buy bread. It could be used for adjusting store 
layouts \(placing items optimally with respect to each other for cross-selling, for promotions, for catalog design and to identify customer segments based on buying patterns. These rules are computed from the data, which is unlike the if-then rules of logic. By the way, association rules are probabilistic in nature Supportî and ìconfidenceî are two important numbers to express the degree of uncertainty about the rule

The support is simply the number of transactions that include all items in both parts of the rule. \(The support is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the total number of records in the database.\  Confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions that include all items in the consequent as well as the antecedent \(namely, the support\ to the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent For example, if a market database has 100,000 point-ofsale transactions, out of which 2,000 include both items A and B and 800 of these include item C, the association rule If A and B are purchased then C is purchased on the same trip" has a support of 800 transactions \(alternatively 0.8%=800/100,000\ and a confidence of 40% \(=800/2,000 Lift is one more parameter of interest in the association rules mining. Lift is the ratio of Confidence to Expected Confidence. Expected Confidence in this case means confidence, if buying A and B does not enhance the probability of buying C." It is the number of transactions that include the consequent divided by the total number of transactions. Suppose the number of total number of transactions for C is 5,000. Thus Expected Confidence is 5,000/1,00,000=5%, and the Lift = Confidence/Expected Confidence = 40%/5% = 8. Hence Lift is a value that gives us information about the increase in probability of the "then consequent\ given the "if" \(antecedent\ part C  Cross-Selling and association rule There are some data analysis techniques to find potential customer of cross-selling in financial industry, such as acquisition patterns 7 From above of this paper, we can see that cross-selling is based on the related products and association rule can represent certain dependencies between products in a given dataset. Itís very easy to find out related products and even unrelated products but often purchased together with the help of the discovered dependencies D  Excel and XLMiner Excel is part of Microsoft Office suite. It is a spreadsheet program that can organize data into lists and then summarize compare, and present data graphically. Excelís forte is performing numerical calculations, and Excel is also very useful for non-numerical applications 8  Excel can find the sum, average, or maximum value of given dataset; create a graph showing what percentage of sales were in a particular range; and show how the total sales compared with the total sales of other days in the same week Shortly, Excel saves us from creating these summaries by hand Now, Excel has become a useful and efficient tool of data management and data analysis for researchers and managers and is even quite indispensable to them XLMiner is a comprehensive data mining add-in for Excel developed by Cytel Software Corporation \(markers of StatXact, LogXact and Egret\ and Distributed by Resampling Stats, Inc It is a toolbelt to help us get quickly started on data mining, offering a variety of methods to analyze large datasets It has extensive coverage of statistical and machine learning techniques for classification,  prediction,  affinity analysis  and data exploration and reduction The first step to use XLMiner is to install it on computer Once installed, it can be registered in Excel as an add-in and emerges as a new option in menu bar. Whatís more, it automatically activates very time when Excel runs Generally, the major researchers of data mining focus on efficient algorithms. Even there has been lots of data mining software, such as Clementine and SAS. But they are almost difficult to use for general people. We focus on the application and propose a simple method of data mining in Excel to accelerate cross-selling, which can be mastered by every one whether with or without specialty knowledge. The following sections illustrate detail process of this method through an example of mining association rule II  M INING ASSOCIATION RULES  A  Data preparation From now on in this paper, a set of bookstore selling data is considered as the dataset to be mined in this paper. They are about customers buying child books\(ChildBks\ youth books\(YouthBks\, cook books \(CookBks\, do it yourself books\(DoItYBks\ reference books\(RefBks\ art books\(ArtBks\ geograph books\(GeogBks\, Secrets of Italian Cooking\(ItalCook\ Historical Atlas of Italy\(ItalAtlas Italian Art\(ItalArt\ and The Art History of Florence\(Florence 9  After confirming which dataset to be mined, the next step is to organize them. Nowadays large scale data are often organized and stored in database, or in spreadsheet at least by their owners Fig.1 shows the datasets in this paper, which are organized in Excel and stored as a spreadsheet In this figure, 1 or 0 in column ChildBks means corresponding customer bought or didnít buy child books The other columns are the same as this B  Data prepprocession The organized dataset is often incomplete, noisy inconsistent and called raw data. It usually does not agree with data mining requirement. Therefore, the dataset have to be preprocessed Data preprocessing describes any type of processing performed on raw data to prepare it for data handling Commonly used as a preliminary data mining practice, data

 Figure 1  Bookstore sales data organized in Excel preprocessing transforms the data into a format that will be more easily and effectively processed for the purpose of the user--for example, mining association rule. There are a number of different tools and methods used for preprocessing, including: sampling, which selects a representative subset from a large population of data transformation, which manipulates raw data to produce a single input; denoising, which removes noise from data normalization, which organizes data for more efficient access; and feature extraction, which pulls out specified data that is significant in some particular context 1  XLMiner provides several tools of data preprocessing such as sampling, missing data handling, binning continuous data and transforming categorical data. The whole process is finished in Excel For simplicity, dataset in this paper is considered as complete and non-noisy C  Mining association rules To mine association rules, we select XLMineróAffinity-Association rules in the menu of Excel and the mining association rules box appears. Some parameters should be set in this box. Mining association rules only need set minimum  Figure 2  Parameters seting in Association Rule box support and minimum confidence. In this example, there are set as 40 and 0.80, as shown in Fig.2 D  Result and its interpreting The result shows as Fig3 From rule #1, it can be said that if an Italian cookbook was bought, a cook book will also be bought. The other rules can be interpreted in the same way This particular rule\(rule #1\has confidence of 100 meaning that, of the people who bought a book named Secrets of Italian Cooking, all \(100%\ bought cookbooks as well.  "Support \(a\ indicates meaning that 54 people bought an Secrets  of  Italian  Cooking  and a cook book, total Support \(c\"  indicates  the  number  of  transactions involving the purchase of cook books, total. \(This is a piece of side information -- it is not involved in calculating the confidence or support for the rule itself.\"Support \(a U c\ is the number of transactions where a Secrets of Italian Cooking and a cook book were bought Lift ratio" indicates how much more likely we are to encounter a cookbook transaction if we consider just those transactions where a Secrets of Italian Cooking is purchased as compared to the entire population of transactions -- it's the confidence divided by support \(c\here the latter is expressed as a percentage III  U SING ASSOCIATION RULES TO ACCELERATE C ROSS S ELLING  The rules mined out can give out which books have close relation and are usually bought together. Based on this, the merchandise can encourage a customer who buys a product Italian cook book , for example\ to buy a related or complementary product \(cook book, for example\. Some related products can be known easily, but the majority can only be known with the help of some other specially analysis tools. Data mining is exactly an effective tool to get related products and accelerate cross-selling, and then help merchandise get additional revenue from clients, offering them similar or complementary products IV  S UMMARY AND DISCUSSION  This paper proposed a method of data mining in Excel with an add-in of XLMiner to accelerate cross-selling and showed that it can be used by general selling people without requirement of specialty knowledge about data mining However, there is certain difficulty in two parametersettings of minimum support and minimum confidence which have no definitely regular and depend on the people of applied field. Additionally, the two parameters influence the result mine out seriously

Finally, shows the extended association rules IV EXPERIMENTS For our experiments we used SQL Server2000 relational DBMS running on a 1.50GHz Pentium M with 504MB RAB The data we used is from the Northwind database of the SQL Server2000 and the relational structure is shown in Fig. 1 The sizes of the tables are as follows The Order Details table has 2155 tuples The Order table has 830 tuples The Customers table has 91 tuples We select 77 kinds of products as the chief attributes to mine the antecedent rules and select Quantity from Order Details table, OrderDate from Order table and ContactTitle and Country from Customers table as the relational attributes to mine the extended consequent rules The minimum support is set 0.5% and the extended minimum confidence is set 40 We will find these antecedent rules containing at least two products Thus, the antecedent rules mined by using our GA will answer the following question What products are frequently ordered together The extended consequent rules mined by using apriori algorithm and statistic method can answer these additional questions as follows How much quantities, what the possible order date is and how the customers are about these products frequently ordered together Figure 6 shows the generations and the number of rules during the GA mining process Table I shows the experimental results after incorporating and extracting the rules containing at least two products Table II shows fourteen extended association rules In the proposed method, the GA found most anteceden t rules.

rules through producing C 830 5 groups while our GA just uses 23968 groups to produce rules. Finally, the extracted extended association rules satisfy the condition of importance and have the qualification for commercial decision. Therefore we need not store retrieve, prune and sort a large number of rules for classification as traditional method V C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we introduce a new data mining method to mine rules from multi-relational databases Our approach has two novel points: One is the ideas of distributed mining by using GA and traditional apriori mining algorithm. Another is the definition of the new extended association rule for supporting the commercial decision better. In our experiment the GA based method is more efficient on the antecedent rules mining than the matrix method and the distributed mining method is also different with other multi-relational data mining methods that need query-processing using SQL language The extended association rule has finer pattern and contains more commercial information. Meanwhile, the number of rules is much less than the standard data mining method producing large candidate rules In the future research we will apply our method to the real world databases with large data and intend to combine the fuzzy logic and our method to predict data R EFERENCES  R.

and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
