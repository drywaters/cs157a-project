Associative classifiers that utilize association rules have been widely studied It has been shown that as\255 sociative classifiers often outperform traditional clas\255 sifiers Associative classifiers usually find only rules with high support values because reducing the min\255 imum support to

be satisfied increases cOlnputational cost However rules with low support but high confi\255 dence may contribute to classification We have pro\255 posed an approach to build a classifier composed of almost all consistent 100 confident rules The pro\255 posed classifier was extended by introducing item re\255 duction and bagging in order to relax the constraint of consistency which resulted in slightly increased perfor\255 mance for Associative 
datasets from the UCI machine learning repository

class\(fiers 
which integrate association mining and classification have been extensively stud\255 ied as a new classification approach 5 4 9 Accord\255 ing to previous studies 5 4 9 high classification ac\255 curacies have been achieved by using associative classi\255 fiers compared with the classification accuracies of tra\255 ditional classifiers such as C4.5 7 and RIPPER 2 CBA 5 the pioneer of associative classification builds a classifier from a set of association rules The ruleset consists of rules with higher support values than a given threshold called minimum support Confident rules with 
low support are not used in CBA mainly be\255 cause such rules cost more than the others We have proposed an associative classifier in which a bottom-up approach is taken for gathering rules 8 In CCIC 8 100 confident rules are used regardless of their support values CCIC showed the best results for several datasets 6 However the restriction of con\255 sistency may too strong to produce more general rules

We therefore relaxed the constraint of consistency in order to have noise-tolerant classifiers Bagging 1 is a widely used method for coping 
with this problem Bagging uses a large number of resampled training in\255 stance sets to strengthen weak learners Bagging with CCIC enables partially consistent rules to be obtained because some instances are lost in the resampled sets Another way to reduce bad affection due to the limited training instances is to remove useless items We con\255 sider also to remove such redundant items 2 Methodology In this section we describe the base classifier CCIC and then a redundancy-removing version and the bagged version 2.1 Problem setting Let II

in general some redundant items in the CCI By the word redundant we mean that some of items can be removed while keeping consistency Therefore we propose a classifier eCCIC classifier that uses the redundancy-removed rules In order to re\255 move the redundant items from a CCI we examine each item in a random order as a candidate for removal As long as the removal does not hurt the consistency we remove it Otherwise we leave the item A processed CCI is referred to as an eCCI an economized CCI 2.5 Bagging Table 3 Summary of the datasets Table Accuracy comparison of CCIC and existing classifiers 0040 0041 13 178 3 We conducted an experiment to evaluate the perfor\255 mance of CCIC and its successors According to the lit\255 erature 5 4 9 we used 26 datasets from the VCI Ma\255 chine Learning Repository 6 A summary of datasets is shown in Table 3 Every instance in the dataset was converted into an itemset Numerical attributes were discretized by 5 bins Here the intervals of specifying the bins were taken so as to make the populations of the attribute values equal in each attribute Negative instances that break the consistency of any positive instance are re\255 moved in order to keep the consistency of the dataset in a weakest sense The number of iterations in finding CCICs was set to  1,000 and the number of copies was set to  100 We compared the results obtained by using the orig\255 inal CCIC 8 eCCIC classifier with redundancy\255 removed rules CCICbag bagged version of CCIC and eCCICbag bagged version of eCCIC We also present the accuracies of C4.5 7 RIPPER 2

sometimes overly trained so as to fit training instances only over-fitting This happens when the classifier is too flexible com\255 pared with the size of the training instance set CCIC is a collection of rules so it can have large flexibility To avoid such an over-fitting a combination of many weak classifiers is known to be effective A typical strategy is to make some copies of the training set by resampling and to average the results so that the vari\255 ance of the classifier is reduced Such an approach is called bagging 1 Therefore we adopt a bagging tech\255 nique with CCIC

Used-for references in the LCSH into holonym/meronym relations in our WKB  In the experiments we assume that each topic comes from an individual user We attempt to evaluate our model in an environment that covers great range of topics However it is not realistic to expect a participant to hold such great range of topics in personal interests Thus for the 50 experimental topics we assume each one coming from an individual user and learn her his personalized ontology An LIR is collected through searching the subject catalogue of Queensland University of Technology QUT Library 3 by using the title of a topic Librarians have assigned title table of content summary and a list of subjects to each information item e.g a book stored in QUT library The assigned subjects are treated as the tags in Web documents that cite the knowledge in the WKB  In order to simplify the experiments we only use the librarian summarized information title table of content and summary to represent an instance in an LIR  All these information can be downloaded from QUT's Web site and are available to the public Once the WKB and an LIR are ready an ontology is learned as described in Section 3.3.1 and personalized as in Section 3.3.2 The user con\002dence rates on the subjects are speci\002ed as in Section 3.3.3 A document d i in the training set is then generated by an instance i  and its support value is determined by support  d i   X s 2 021  i  s 2S sup  s Q  14 where s 2 S in O  Q  are as de\002ned in De\002nition 5 As sup  s Q   0 for s 2 S 000 according to Eq 11 the documents with support  d   0 go to D 000  whereas those with support  d   0 go to D   4.4 Performance Measures The performance of the experimental models are measured by three methods the precision averages at eleven standard recall levels 11SPR the mean average precision MAP and the F 1 Measure They are all based on precision and recall the modern IR evaluation methods The 11SPR is reported suitable for information gathering and is used in TREC evaluations as a performance measuring standard An 11SPR v alue is computed by summing the interpolated precisions at the speci\002ed recall cutoff and then dividing by the number of topics P N i 1 precision 025 N  025  f 0  0  0  1  0  2      1  0 g  15 N is the number of topics and 025 are the cutoff points where the precisions are interpolated At each 025 point an aver3 http://library.qut.edu.au Figure 2 Experimental 11SPR Results age precision value over N topics is calculated These average precisions then link to a curve describing the recallprecision performance The MAP is a stable and discriminating choice in information gathering evaluations and is recommended for measuring general-purpose information gathering methods The average precision for each topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each relevant document is retrieved The MAP for the 50 experimental topics is then the mean of the average precision scores of each of the individual topics in the experiments The MAP re\003ects the performance in a non-interpolated recall-precision fashion F 1 Measure is also well accepted by the information gathering community which is calculated by F 1  2 002 precision 002 recall precision  recall  16 Precision and recall are evenly weighted in F 1 Measure For each topic the macro F 1 Measure averages the precision and recall and then calculates F 1 Measure whereas the micro F 1 Measure calculates the F 1 Measure for each returned result and then averages the F 1 Measure values The greater F 1 values indicate the better performance 5 Results and Discussions The experiments attempt to evaluate our proposed model by comparing to an implementation of mental model We expect that the ONTO model can achieve at least the close performance to the TREC model The experimental 11SPR results are illustrated in Fig 2 At recall point 0.3 the TREC model slightly outperformed the ONTO model but at 0.5 and 0.6 the ONTO model achieved better results than the TREC model subtly At all other points their 11SPR results are just the same For the MAP results shown on Table 1 the ONTO model achieved 0.284 which is just 0.006 below the TREC model 2

Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
