To discover common learning misconception of learners, this study employs the association rule to mine learner profile for diagnosing learners  common learning misconception during learning processes. In this paper, the association rules that occurring misconception A implies occurring misconception B can be discovered utilizing the proposed association rule learning diagnosis approach. Meanwhile, the obtained association rules for the common learning misconception are applied to tune courseware structure as well as perform remedy learning. Experiment results indicate that applying the proposed learning diagnosis approach can correctly discover learners  common learning misconception according to learner profile and help learners to learn more effectively 1. Introduction Although many web-based learning techniques have been proposed to assist web-based learning, few researches take into account the issue of learning diagnosis for the developed web-based tutoring systems. The learning diagnosis aims to identify learners  misconception for promoting learning performance during learning processes. Generally, the discovered learner  s misconception can be served as important feedback that web-based tutoring systems provide for performing remedy learning or revising tutoring strategies In past researches, several researchers paid attention to the issue of learning diagnosis for web-based learning systems. Cheng  s study [1] focused on creating the concept hierarchy by embedding important concepts in a test, and then analyzed the results with a hierarchical coding scheme for learning diagnosis Hwang  s study [2] proposed a computer-assisted approach for teachers to define and analyze concept effect relationships, thus helping them to diagnose student  s learning problems. Wang  s study [3 developed an adaptive hierarchical concept level courseware for English prepositions. Based on the formative evaluation results from the proposed test levels, the system diagnoses learner  s error types in English prepositions learning and identifies the reasons behind their misconception The personalized e-learning system \(PELS on Item Response Theory [4], which considers both courseware difficulty and learner ability to provide individual learning paths for learners, was presented in our previous study [5]. However, this system lacks to identify particular learning misconception for learners This study proposes an association rule learning diagnosis approach to analyze learner profile in order to assist PELS to explore learners  common learning misconception. According to the learners   misconception, the proposed system can provide 


misconception, the proposed system can provide suitable remedy learning courseware to learners to perform enhanced learning. Moreover, this study also proposes a mechanism of courseware structure modification to slightly tune the difficulty parameters of courseware according to the discovered learning misconception, thus modifying the courseware recommendation sequence for the provided personalized e-learning services. Experimental results show that the proposed personalized e-learning system with the proposed learning diagnosis mechanism can help teachers and learners to identify learning misconception based on the proposed association rule learning diagnosis approach, helping learners to learn more effectively in a web-based environment 2. System architecture In order to discover the common learning misconception, this study proposes a learning diagnosis and remedy learning agent embedded in the proposed personalized e-learning system \(PELS which can perform remedy learning based on learners   common learning misconception and modify the Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies  ICALT  05 0-7695-2338-2/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE difficulty parameters of courseware for courseware structure modification 2.1. Diagram of system architecture The personalized e-learning system \(PELS on the Item Response Theory, which includes an offline courseware modeling process, four intelligent agents and four databases, is presented in our previous study [5]. However, the PELS mainly focuses on performing adaptive learning based on the difficulty parameters of courseware and learner ability for individual learner, the learning diagnosis and remedy learning mechanisms are lacked features in this system In this paper, the features of the PELS system are extended to include the test agent, testing item database, learning diagnosis and remedy learning agent in order to perform learning misconception diagnosis for promoting learning performance. The system architecture is shown as Figure 1 Figure 1. The system architecture 2.2. System components 2.2.1. Courseware database. In order to simultaneously satisfy both the normal and remedy learning requirements, the courses database is distinguished into two major parts, which include the standard courseware database and remedy courseware database, respectively. The details are described as follows 1 courseware database contains course materials for the normal learning process 2 database contains course materials with easier difficulty level than the course materials in the standard courseware database to convey similar learning concepts with the discovered learners   learning misconception for the remedy learning process 2.2.2. Test agent. To diagnose learners  common learning misconception during learning processes therefore, this study proposes a courseware construction process for learning courseware and their corresponding testing items. Figure 2 shows the detailed procedures to explain how to construct the courseware and their corresponding testing items. The management agent provides a friendly interface to interact with teachers for courseware and testing item 


interact with teachers for courseware and testing item construction. When teachers login this system to add testing items, the system would automatically build the relationship between added testing items and their corresponding courseware. In other words, to perform the testing item with corresponding courseware can evaluate whether the learner understands the learning courseware or not. Moreover, the test agent can communicate with both the testing item database and courseware database. During the learning process, the learner learns the recommended courseware, and then the test agent immediately chooses the corresponding testing item from the testing item database to evaluate whether the learner can understand the recommended courseware or not. The tested results are recorded in the user profile database for diagnosing the learner  s learning misconception. In this study, the  wrong answers  will be served as  misconception  for the proposed association rule learning diagnosis approach Courses Database Item Database Teacher Item Management Agent Add Item Course concept Item-course relationships 12 3 4 Figure 2. The courseware construction process for the learning courseware and their corresponding testing item 2.2.3. Learning diagnosis and remedy learning agent. As mentioned-above, the user profile database contains learners  responses for the testing items after learners learn the recommended courseware. In order to provide the remedial instructions for learners to revise learning misconception, the learning diagnosis and remedy learning agent identifies particular leaning misconception for learners utilizing the proposed learning diagnosis approach. Figure 3 illustrates the detailed operation procedures for the proposed learning diagnosis and remedy learning mechanisms Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies  ICALT  05 0-7695-2338-2/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE The following subsections first describe how to perform data preparation in detail 2.2.3.1. Data preparation. Data preprocessing aims at cleaning and transferring the data in the user profile database into suitable format for association rule mining. The details of operation procedure are described as follows Step 1. Select the needed database fields as the features, including e-mail, unit ID courseware ID and test result. Table 1 illustrates the needed features in this study Step 2. Count the total number of learned pages for each learner  s account Step 3. Delete the account which the amount of learned pages is less than the assigned threshold Step 4. Transform data into the simplified representation notations for association rule mining. Table 2 gives the list of the simplified representation notations Figure 3. The detailed procedures for the learning

The transferred representation notations in the user profile database for association rule mining Learner  s correct testing item response  Learner  s incorrect testing item response This courseware has not been learned 2.2.3.2. Pattern discovery. In this study, pattern discovery aims to discover implicit learning misconception from a large amount of learning portfolio records. Among data mining techniques, the association rule is a well-known data mining technique which can discover implicit relationships among item sets in a transaction database. Hence, in order to discover learning misconception based on the incorrect testing item responses and their corresponding courseware, Apriori algorithm [6] is employed to perform the data mining task. Let I 1I , 2I  mI  be a set of m  distinct attributes, T be transaction that contains a set of items such that IT ? , D be a database with different transaction records. An association rule is an implication in the form of YX? , where X , IY ?  are sets of items called itemsets, and ?=?YX . X  is called antecedent while Y  is called consequent, the rule means X  implies Y There are two important basic measures for association rules, support\(s c  which can be defined as follows. The support \(s association rule is the ratio of the records that contain YX ?  to the total number of records in the database   YXSupportTYXSupport ?=? \(1 For a given number of records, confidence \(c ratio \(in percent  YX ? to the number of records that contain X       XSupp YXSupp TYXConf   2 The discovered association rules must satisfy the pre-defined minimum support and confidence from a given database. Besides, mining association rule is typically a two-step process [6 Step 1: Find all sets of items which occur with a frequency that is greater than or equal to the user-specified threshold support\(s Step 2: Generate the desired rules using the large itemsets, which have user-specified threshold confidence\(c 2.2.3.3. Pattern verification. It is an important task to evaluate the validity for the discovered learning misconception. In this study, after the learner finishes the learning process for the recommended courseware the learner will be guided to perform an overall posttest for the learned course unit. The test agent also gathers the answer sheet of the learner for the 


gathers the answer sheet of the learner for the verification of the discovered learning misconception Here, we also use the association rule to mine the answer sheet in the posttest, then getting the Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies  ICALT  05 0-7695-2338-2/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE discovered association rule set of 2R . Assume the discovered association rule set from the on-line testing during learning process as set 1R . The association rule set of 1R  can belong to learner  s temporal memory, but the association rule set of 2R  from an overall posttest belongs to learner  s permanent memory. To execute remedy learning more efficiently, the proposed method adopts the intersection of sets 1R  and 2R to obtain the final diagnosis misconception and stores them into the rule pattern database for remedy learning and courseware structure modification 2.2.3.4. Rule patterns for remedy learning and courseware structure modification. In this study, the discovered rule patterns for learners  common learning misconception will be applied to modify the difficulty parameters of courseware in the courseware database This result will lead to the change of the courseware recommendation sequence for the proposed personalized e-learning system. Moreover, the discovered learning misconception is also used to perform remedy learning to promote learning performance for individual learner. The experimental results are demonstrated in the next section 3. Experiments To verify the quality of rules patterns for learning misconception in the proposed personalized e-learning system with learning diagnosis and remedy learning mechanisms, some university students who have majored in the course of C language programming were invited to test this system. The experimental results are described as follows 3.1. The used user profile database In our experiments, the course unit  Loop  in the course category  C Language Programming  which includes courseware with various difficulty levels to convey the concept of the  Loop  is used to test the performance of the proposed learning misconception diagnosis approach. Table 3 gives a list of statistics data in the user profile database for the learning misconception mining Table 3. Statistic data in the user profile database The number of learner accounts 93 The number of course materials in the course unit  Loop   33 Total number of learning records in the user profile database 1,711 The assigned threshold for the number of learned courseware 20 The number of learner accounts that satisfies the assigned threshold 31 3.2. Learning misconception diagnosis Table 4 illustrates six discovered common learning misconception rules in the course unit  Loop  by the proposed association rule learning diagnosis approach We find that the discovered misconception satisfies the 


We find that the discovered misconception satisfies the learning hierarchy of concept in the course unit  Loop   For example, the rule 2 indicates that occurring misconception  introduction of syntax of while instruction  implies that misconception  flowchart of do while instruction  will also occur. This rule shows the previous concept is pre-requisite knowledge of the latter concept. Moreover, we also analyze why to obtain the rule 1 that occurring misconception  introduction of syntax of while instruction  implies that misconception  example 1 of infinite loop  will also occur. The reason is because the courseware of  example 1 of infinite loop  gives a programming example of infinite loop written by  while  instruction Besides, the rules 5, 6 contain two premises to imply a single conclusion. Moreover, the rule 4 contains one premise to imply two conclusion parts. Next, we describe how to apply the obtained association rules for learners  common misconception to tune the courseware structure through modifying the difficulty parameters of courseware in the courseware database Table 4.

Modifying the difficulty parameters of courseware Assume that the proposed method discovered the rule patterns A ? B for learning misconception, the rule represents that occurring misconception A implies that the misconception B will also occur. In other words, this rule indicates that the misconception A is easier than the misconception B. Therefore, assume the original difficulty levels of courseware in the 


original difficulty levels of courseware in the courseware database for the misconception A and B are that A is larger than B. The difficulty parameters of courseware A and B will be exchanged to modify the courseware recommendation sequence for the proposed personalized e-learning system. On the contrary, assume the original difficulty parameters in the courseware database for the misconception A and B are that A is smaller than B. The difficulty parameters of courseware A and B will not be changed. Table 5 gives an example for modifying difficulty parameters of courseware Table 5. An example for modifying difficulty parameters of courseware Rule Patterns The original difficulty parameters of courseware in the courseware database Revise difficulty parameter A=0.8, B=0.5 A&gt;B Yes A ? B This rule stands for the courseware A is easier than the courseware B A=0.6, B=0.8 A&lt;B No 3.4. Performing Remedy Learning According to the discovered rule patterns for common learning misconception, the remedy learning agent will compare the discovered common rule pattern set 1R  from the on-line testing during learning processes with the discovered common rule pattern stet 2R  from an overall posttest to determine the remedy learning strategy. Table 6 gives an example to show the strategy for the remedy learning. If the set 21 RR ?  is not empty set, then the remedy learning agent will guide the learner to learn the remedial course materials in the remedy courseware database. This is very helpful to learners because the learners  common misconception can be enhanced again to promote learning performance 4. Conclusion This study presents an association rule learning diagnosis approach for learning misconception diagnosis. The proposed approach can discover learner  s misconception according to incorrect testing item responses during learning processes. The obtained association rules for learner  s common misconception can be applied to tune courseware structure through modifying the difficulty parameters of courseware in the courseware database. Moreover, this paper also offers a remedy learning strategy based on the discovered learner misconception to promote learning performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can precisely discover learner  s misconception based on the response answers of testing items and help learners to enhance their misconception for learning performance promotion Table 6.

Fig. 5. FP-tree for the database TDB in TableI nodes of theFP-tree In the next scan, the set of sorted \(frequency descending order prefix-tree as a branch. The root node of the tree is labeled with "null", every other node in theFP-tree additionally stores a counter which keeps track of the number of itemsets that share that node. When the frequent items are sorted in their frequency descending order, there are better chances that more prefixes can be shared, thus theFP-tree representation of the database can be kept as small as possible The compact transaction database and CT-tree data structure introduced in the previous sections are very different from above approaches. First of all, the prefix-tree andFP-tree data structure are constructed in the main memory to optimize the frequent pattern mining process, whereas CT-tree is designed to generate compact transaction database and store it to disk for efficient frequent pattern mining and othermining process in which compact database can save storage space and reduce mining time In addition, the counter associated with each node in the prefix-tree and FP-tree stores the number of transaction containing the itemset represented by the path from the root to the node. However, each path from every node of the CT-tree to the root represents a unique transaction, and the associated counter records the number of occurrences of this transaction in the original transaction database Moreover, for a given transaction database, the number of nodes and node-links in FP-tree will change with different minimum support threshold specified by the user. But there is only one unchanged CT-tree for every transaction database And the FP-tree structure can be constructed from a compact transaction database more efficiently in only one database scan, since the head part of a compact transaction database lists all items in frequency descending order, and the body part stores all ordered transactions associated with their occurrence counts VII. CONCLUSIONS We have proposed an innovative approach to generating compact transaction databases for efficient frequent pattern mining. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by the experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets. It can not only reduce the number of transactions in the original databases and save storage space but also greatly reduce theI/O time required by database scans and improve the efficiency of the mining process We have assumed in this paper that the CT-tree data structure will fit into main memory. However, this assumption will not apply for very large databases. In that case, we plan to partition original databases into several small parts until the corresponding CT-tree can be fit in the available memory. This work is currently in progress VIII.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
