These theories indicate the possibility of various new approaches of datamining. We demonstrate the potential through proposal of a novel approach QARMINT. It performs complete mining of generic QARs within a low time complexity which has not been well addressed in the past work. Its performance evaluation shows high practicality 1. Introduction Since an algorithm of Basket Analysis was proposed by Agrawal and Srikant [1], a large number of researches on more ef?cient Basket Analysis have been presented in the eld of data mining. A basic principle underlying all of the algorithms is the bottom up building of candidate itemsets in a lattice under a downward closure property of itemsets i.e  if any given itemset  is not large, any superset of  will also not be large  The most representative measure to introduce the downward closure property of the itemsets is  support  i.e., occurrence frequency of an itemset in given transaction data. If an itemset  occurs more than a threshold value, i.e  minimum support  it is called a  frequent itemset  When two itemsets   and   sharing their     elements are frequent, their join   is a candidate frequent itemset Some issues remain in the current Basket Analysis where transactions and itemsets are limited to ?nite Boolean sets The aforementioned basic principle has wider applicability not limited to the search on the ?nite Boolean lattice, because it requires only a search space having \(1 tion between two sets and \(2 among sets. In spite of this wide applicability, the framework of the Basket Analysis has not been extended to address more generic tasks Another issue is the analysis of transaction data including items with numeric values such as        and            These items are called  numeric items  whereas the items having categorical values such as           are called  categorical items  The clause of an item such as    is called an  attribute  Some categorical item may be only a clause as    without its value. An association rule in which every numeric item has appropriate intervals of its value is called a  quantitative association rule  QAR is         d                         which states  a person who is thirties and married owns two cars  Since Srikant and Agrawal proposed an approach to mine QARs [2], number of studies on the QAR mining have been made. However, the problem to mine a complete set of QARs in generic form under representative mining measures is known to be NP-complete [4]. The state of the art has not addressed the complete mining of generic

Second, we propose a novel approach and its implementation for complete mining of generic QARs within a  l o w  t i m e  c o m p l e x i t y          b a s e d  o n  t h e  e x t e n s i o n  w h e r e    i s  t h e  n u m b e r  o f  t r a n s a c t i o n s  i n  d a t a   T h i s approach is called QAR mining by Monotonic INTerval QARMINT time complexity in terms of the data amount is essential for mining large data. Third, its performance evaluation is presented to show practicality 2. Extension of Basket Analysis As mentioned earlier, the basic principle of the Basket Analysis requires only a search space having \(1 eration between two sets and \(2 erty among sets.

Simulations One has run simulations comparing the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm and the new algorithm here. A typical multisensor multitarget tracking environment is assumed in the simulations. According to article [1,3], One known that the performance of sequential MSJPDA is better than the performance of parallel MSJPDA. Therefore, the performance of parallel MSJPDA algorithm will not be compared here There are three sensors, which are fixed in three platforms. Regarding the 2nd sensor as fusion centre situation of the other sensors are: =?-500m?-500m 0m??N =?-500m? 500m?0m??The distance error of each sensor is: =300m, =200m, =100m?The bear error of each sensor is 0.03rad, =0.02rad, =0.01rad?The of sample is T=1s?The nonparametric model of clutter is used in the simulations, and expected number of false measurement is m=1.8 1 sN 3 s 1r 2 2r 3 3r 1 Simulations have been run for racking two targets. The true initialization state of the targets is X1?[-29500m,400m/s,34500m,-400m/s X ?[-26250m,296m/s,34500m,-400m/s]'? 2 The two targets will cross above 31seconds later. To evaluate tracking performance, 50 Monte Carlo runs were performed for three case of the target detection probability Pd=0.97 ? Pd=0.76 ? Pd=0.58. In every run, the total simulation time is 140 steps 


simulation time is 140 steps            Figure 1  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.97          Figure 2  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.97       Figure 3  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.76 567 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005         Figure 4  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.76         Figure 5  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.58          Figure 6  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.58  Table 1 The emanative times comparison for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm  Pd N A  0.97 0. 76 0.58 Sequential MSJPDA 2 11 17 SD-CMSJPDA 0 3 5 Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative 


Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative times, A denotes the kind of algorithm Table 1 shows the summation of emanative times for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm in 50 Monte Carlo simulations. From table 1 , it is shown that the stability of SD-CMSJPDA is better than that of sequential MSJPDA as the detection probability varied Figure 1,2 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0. 97, respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.76 respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.58, respectively. From the figures we can see that the average RMS position error is lower for the SD-CMS JPDA algorithm. We also see that the state estimation precision of sequential MSJPDA get worse as the detection probability decreases The reasons for these simulation results lies:1 state estimation precision will get worse when the detection probability decrease;2 algorithm is to process measurement from each sensor using single sensor JPDA algorithm sequentially. Therefore the estimation error from each sensor will be accumulated Moreover, the sequential MSJPDA algorithm can  t improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system The estimation error of the SD- CMSJPDA  algorithm will not be accumulated for it processes the measurement from each sensor directly in the mean time .What  s more the new method can greatly improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system. Therefore, the tracking performance of SD-CMSJPDA algorithm is better than that of sequential MSJPDA. Algorithm All of the simulations are run in the personal computer with a 2.0G CPU and a 256M memory. The average cost time per step is 0.0251 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. And the average cost time per step is 0.0282 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. According to the results we can see that there is few difference in real time between the new method and the sequential   MSJPDA when there is not so many sensors and targets 568 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  5. Conclusion In order to solve the problem of multisensor multi target tracking, a new centralized multisensor  joint probabilistic data association  algorithm is proposed in this paper. The simulation results shows that the tracking performance of the new algorithm is better than that of the sequential MSJPDA algorithm The computational complexity of the new method will increase as the number of sensors and targets grow Therefore, how to improve the real time of SD- CMSJPDA algorithm will be pay attention References 1] He You, Wang Guohong, Lu Dajin, Peng Yingning Multisensor Information Fusion With Application[M Publishion House of Electronics Industry. 2000, Beijing.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
