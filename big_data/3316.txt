Department of Computer Science Zhejiang University Hangzhou 310027 China Abstract Taxi GPS traces provide us with rich information about the human mobility pattern in modern cities Instead of designing the bus route based on inaccurate human survey regarding peopleês mobility pattern we intend to address the night-bus route planning issue by leveraging taxi GPS traces In this paper we propose a two-phase approach based on the crowd-sourced GPS data for night-bus route planning In the rst phase we develop a process to cluster hot areas with dense passenger pick-up/drop-off and then propose effective methods to split big hot areas into clusters and identify a location in each cluster as a candidate bus stop In the second phase given the bus route origin destination candidate bus stops as well as bus operation time constraints we derive several effective rules to build bus routing graph and prune the invalid stops and edges iteratively We further develop two heuristic algorithms to automatically generate candidate bus routes and nally we select the best route which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach extensive empirical studies are performed on a real-world taxi GPS data set which contains more than 1.57 million passenger delivery trips generated by 7,600 taxis for a month in Hangzhou China Index Terms Taxi GPS Traces Human Movement Patterns Bus Routes Planning I I NTRODUCTION Buses are a popular and economical way for people to travel around the city and they are generally greener than cars and taxis as they help to decrease trafìc congestion fuel consumption carbon dioxide emission and travel cost Thus for sustainable city development people are encouraged to take public transportation for work visit etc In many cities the daytime bus transportation systems are usually well designed however during late night most bus systems are out of service leaving taxis as the only way for getting around Many cities start to plan night-through bus systems to provide cost-effective and environment friendly transport to citizens With the increasingly wide deployment of GPS devices and pervasive sensors more and more digital traces left by people while interacting with cyber-physical spaces have been accumulated 17 18 F o r instance taxis in man y cities are equipped with GPS devices nowadays and rich information about the taxis including where and when passengers are picked-up or dropped-off which route a taxi takes for a certain trip can be collected and extracted This big crowd-sourced data collected using pervasive sensing contains passengers time-dependent mobility patterns in a city making it possible to optimally plan night-bus routes by estimating the number of passengers expected along the routes Previously bus route planning mainly relied on human surveys to understand the peopleês mobility patterns Although this approach w a s proved to be workable the time and cost spent in the survey process are quite substantial Pervasive sensing communication and computing bring us new ways to sense the pulses of the city at real-time and low cost understand the situation collectively and quantitatively and create opportunities to enable new applications in urban planning In this paper we intend to explore the night-bus route design problem leveraging the taxi GPS traces First of all we need to identify the candidate bus stops which are associated with locations having big number of taxi passenger pick-up and drop-off records  PDRs  the bus stops should be evenly distributed in the hot districts to facilitate peopleês access After the candidate bus stops are xed the next step is to select a bus route which connects the bus origin and a sequence of bus stops to the destination carrying the maximum number of passengers within a deìned time duration Fortunately the taxi GPS traces contain quantitative spatial-temporal information about all taxi trips By mining the taxi GPS data we can inform where are the hot areas for taxi passengers and how many passengers would potentially travel along a certain route Therefore the night-bus route design becomes a problem of comparing the number of passengers of all valid bus routes giving certain time constraints However identifying the candidate bus stops from taxi GPS data and enumerating the top-ranked bus routes efìciently are not trivial and straight-forward To the best of our knowledge there is still no work reported on candidate bus stop identiìcation and bus route design leveraging taxi GPS data Consider the taxi GPS trajectories and the converted bus routing graph shown in Fig 1 seven dense taxi pick-up/drop-off locations i.e C 1  C 7  are identiìed as candidate bus stops where C 1 and C 7 are designated as the bus origin and destination respectively The objective of bus route design is to nd a bus route from C 1 to C 7 with maximum number of passengers expected given the bus operation frequency and total travel time Apparently to design an effective bus route we need to address the following research challenges First the taxi passenger pick-up and drop-off points are 978-1-4673-4575-0/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 2013 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications \(PerCom 18--22 March 2013 225 


 C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 C 5 C 6 C 7 C 4 C 2 C 1 C 3 C 5 C 6 C 7 Fig 1 An illustrative example of the taxi GPS trajectories left and the converted bus routing graph right distributed in the whole city with some areas having more PDRs than other areas but there is no clear guideline about where the bus stops should be put Thus there needs a method to identify candidate bus stops from taxi passenger pickup/drop-off distributions Second to deliver the maximum number of passengers the best bus route should leave from the bus origin C 1  go through all the intermediate bus stops and nally reach the destination C 7  That is the bus route would follow the sequence of bus stops as C 1  C 2  C 5  C 3  C 4  C 6  C 7  However the problem for this route is that the whole trip would take a very long time to complete which is intolerable if the number of candidate bus stops is big Thus a non-trivial trade-off has to be made between the number of passengers expected along the route and the total time travelled Third as there is no taxi passenger travelling from C 4 to C 7 in Fig 1 left if we design the bus route as C 1  C 2  C 3  C 7  then the signiìcant passenger ow in paths C 2  C 4 and C 3  C 4 cannot be accommodated Alternatively by including C 4 in the planned bus route as C 1  C 2  C 3  C 4  C 7  all the passenger ows in C 2  C 4  C 3  C 4  C 2  C 7 and C 3  C 7 are accommodated with the cost of adding one more stop Therefore even the path C 4  C 7 has no passenger ow but adding it to the planned bus route would lead to a better solution due to passenger ow accumulation from all previous stops and paths Finally besides the passenger ow accumulation along the bus route we also need to consider that the passenger ows are usually different from time to time For instance the passenger ow during 23:00-24:00 might be very different from that during 3:00-4:00 Thus we have to consider the passenger ows accumulated and the total number of passengers in all concerned timeslots while selecting the planned bus route In this paper we propose a two-phase approach to address the above-mentioned challenges In the rst phase we identify the candidate bus stops leveraging the taxi GPS data In the second phase with all the candidate bus stops identiìed and the bus route OD designated we develop effective rules and heuristic algorithms to generate the bus route with maximum number of passengers expected under the time constraints with the process shown in Fig 2 In summary the main contributions of this paper include First we propose a two-phase approach to tackle the nightbus route design problem leveraging the taxi GPS data To the best of our knowledge this is the rst work on night bus route design using the taxi travel speed time and PDRs information  Fig 2 The two-phase bus route planning framework Second we develop a novel process with effective methods to cluster hot areas with dense passenger pick-up/drop-off split big hot areas into walkable size ones and identify candidate bus stops It is veriìed that the proposed method outperforms the popular k means method in terms of soundness of selected bus stop location and evenness of selected bus stop distribution Third we derive several effective rules to build the directed bus routing graph where nodes and edges represent the candidate bus stops and valid connections among stops respectively To ensure the bus would reach destination in the end and reduce the computation complexity we also develop an iterative process to remove invalid nodes and edges Finally we propose two heuristic algorithms for automatically generating valid bus routes One is the probability based spreading algorithm which randomly selects the next stop among the possible candidate stops in each step giving the candidate stop with high accumulated passenger ow a big probability for random selection the other is the top-k spreading algorithm which selects k nodes with high accumulated passenger ows as candidate stops in each step It is veriìed that the probability based spreading algorithm outperforms the top-k approach in the selection of best bus routes II R ELATED WORK Here we brieîy review the related work which can be grouped into two categories The rst category is about making use of taxi GPS traces for urban planning and trafìc management The existing work includes automatic map construction detecting hot spots and frequent tra v e l patterns 8 predicting road trafìc conditions informing land use and function distribution 13 unco v ering inef cient road network connectivity planning optimal dri ving route 14 and various applications such as next passenger nding anomalous trajectory discovery Among the taxi GPS trace related papers the work addressing hotspots and frequent travel OD patterns are relevant to our work for identifying candidate bus stops and providing passenger ow data among potential bus stops but there is no paper except one using those data for b u s route planning The main goal of is to mine historic taxi GPS trips to suggest a exible bus route The work rst clusters trips with similar starting time duration origin and destination it then attempts to identify the route that connects multiple dense taxi trip 226 


clusters The work is different from ours as it only chooses the route which maximizes the sum of each connected trip cluster In another word it does not consider the time constraints and the accumulated effects among connection stops thus it would never include the path like C 4  C 7 of Fig 1 in the planned bus route while our approach might include the path as long as the route expects the maximum number of accumulated passengers and the total travel time constraint can be met The second category is about the bus network design which is an intensive studied area in urban planning and transportation eld The bus network design is known to be a complex non-linear non-convex multi-objective NP-hard problem 9 The aim is to determine b u s routes and operation frequencies that achieve certain objectives subject to the constraints and passenger ows The popular objectives include shortest route shortest travel time lowest operation cost maximum passenger ow maximum area coverage and maximum service quality while the constraints include time capacity and resources However the selection of the objectives should take care of the operator as well as user requirements which are often conîicting leading to design trade-off rather than an optimal solution As noted in early bus network design is mainly based on human survey to get passenger ows and user demands it relies heavily on heuristics and intuitive principles developed by a designerês own experience and practice Recent work on bus network design also assumes that the passenger ows are given by user survey or population estimation the best solving algorithms are based on heuristic procedures to nd sub-optimal solutions A detailed review about route network design can be found in Despite the renewed attention for bus network design there is still no work addressing the night-bus route design problem leveraging the taxi passenger OD ow data Different from existing research our work aims to nd a bus route with a xed frequency maximizing the number of passengers expected along the route subject to the total travel time constraint This problem is different from the traditional Travelling Salesman Problem TSP in nature which aims to nd the shortest path that visits each given location node exactly once TSP evaluates different routes with exact N locations which means all candidate stops should be included in the route Our problem is also different from the shortest path nding problem which intends to get the shortest path for a g i v en OD pair In our case we have to consider the accumulated effect passenger ows from all previous stops to current stop for choosing the bus route III C ANDIDATE B US S TOP I DENTIFICATION In the proposed two-phase bus route planning framework the objective of phase one is to identify candidate bus stops by exploiting the taxi PDRs  The whole process consists of three steps 1 Divide the whole city into small equal-sized grid cells mark those hot grid cells with high taxi PDRs for further processing 2 Merge the adjacent hot grid cells to form hot areas divide each big area into walkable size  Fig 3 City partitions near Hangzhou Railway Station Each city partition is marked with a different color cluster 3 Choose one grid cell as the candidate bus stop location in each walkable size hot cluster by assuming that passengers from the same cluster would easily walk to the stop to take the bus A Hot Grid Cells and City Partitions In this work we rst divide the city into equal-sized grid cells with each cell about 10 m  10 m  In such a way the whole city is partitioned into 5000  2500 cells in total Out of all the grid cells over 95 of them contain no taxi passenger PDRs as they are either lakes mountains buildings and highways that cannot be reached or stopped by taxis or suburb areas that people seldom travel to Only 0.11 of them have more than 0.2 PDRs per hour on average if we only count the PDRs in late night And we name these grid cells as hot ones As each grid cell has maximum eight neighbors if we deìne the connectivity degree  CD  of a hot grid cell as the number of hot neighboring cells the CD of any grid cell will range from 0 to 8 where the hot grid cell with CD equal to 0 is called isolated cell As the city is composed of mixed hot grid cells and common grid cells both hot cells and common cells form irregular hot areas and common areas as a consequence of same type of cells being adjacent to each other These hot areas are also called city partitions as shown in Fig.3 Apparently some small partitions like the small ones in Fig 3 can be very close to some big ones like the black and red ones in Fig 3 It would be necessary to consider all the city partitions globally in order to plan the bus stop locations thus city partitions close to each other had better merge to form big clusters for better overall bus stop distribution In the next section we propose a simple strategy to merge the close partitions into bigger clusters B Cluster Merging and Splitting We present the cluster merging and splitting approach in Algorithm 1 After obtaining all city partitions we sort them in a descending order according to the number of PDRs Line1 To merge the partitions close to each other iteratively we propose to use the hottest partition to absorb its nearby partitions according to the descending order of PDRs  until no more nearby partitions meet the merging criteria Line8 Then we choose the next hottest partition to repeat the same 227

averaging all ow matrix at different bus frequencies We also assume TM keeps unchanged across the night time tm  s i s j  is the average travel time multiply by   which is a constant We set  1  5 to consider the speed difference between taxis and bus For the paths having no taxi trip occurring in history for instance nobody travels by taxi due to too short distance we use Ddist  s i  s j  v to approximate tm  s i s j   where Ddist  s i s j  is the driving distance between s i and s j  and v is set to 50 km/h  B Bus Routing Graph Building and Pruning Selecting the best bus route is a very challenging problem as two conîicting requirements must be met one is to ensure that the bus route would traverse intermediate stops and nally reach the destination within a limited time the other is to maximize the number of passengers accumulated along the route For example if we choose the stop with the heaviest passenger ow from the origin as the rst node and then keep choosing the next stop following the heaviest passenger ow principle then we might neither reach the destination nor achieve the objective of having the maximum number of passengers accumulated along the route To meet the above two requirements and follow the intuitive principles in bus route design some basic criterion should be set for bus routing graph building and candidate bus route selection 1 Routing graph building criteria Obviously there would be numerous stop combinations for a given OD pair and only a small proportion of them meet the rst or second requirement To reduce the search space of possible stops and routes we can build a bus routing graph starting from origin to destination using heuristic rules For instance from the shortest travel time perspective the bus route should extend from origin towards the direction of destination it can be further converted into three rules each new selected stop should be farther from the origin closer to destination and farther from previous stop From the intuitive bus route design principle the bus stops should not be too far from each other also the bus route should not comprise sharp zig-zag paths These can also be translated into two criterion in building the bus routing graph Speciìcally given the OD pair  s 1 s n  and the candidate route R   s 1 s 2   s n   we should obey the following criterion when building the bus routing graph  Criteria 1 Adequate stop distance dist  s i 1 s i    i 1  2   n  1 where  is a user-speciìed parameter We set  1  5 km  which means the maximum distance between two consecutive stops should be no more than 1  5 km   Criteria 2 Move forward x new  i 1 x new  i   i 1  2   n  1 x new  i  x  i os   y  i in   tan  1 y  n   x  n   x  i  y  i  of the s i is got by simply subtracting the longitude and latitude value to that of s 1  x new is the  X Y X new Y new     Fig 5 Demonstration of Criteria 2 left and Criteria 5 right value of X-axis of stop in the new coordination which is with s 1 as the origin and from s 1 to s n as the direction of X-axis see the left panel in Fig 5 This criteria guarantees the bus will always move forward along the OD direction  Criteria 3 Source-farther dist  s i 1 s 1   dist  s i s 1   i 1  2   n  1 This ensures that the bus will move away from the origin s 1 farther in each step  Criteria 4 Destination-closer dist  s i 1 s n   dist  s i s n   i 1  2   n  1 This ensures the bus will move closer to the destination s n in each step  Criteria 5 No zigzag route arg min    s j  dist  s i 1 s j   s i  j 1  2   i  Criteria 5 ensures the smoothness of the route There would be no sharp zigzag path along the OD direction The route demonstrated in the right panel of Fig 5 should not happen as it violates the no zigzag route criteria We can see arg min dist  s 3 s j   s 1   s 2  j 1  2  also arg min dist  s 4 s j   s 2   s 3  j 1  2  3  2 Graph building and pruning The aim of graph building is to construct a directed graph with nodes and links given an OD pair in which the nodes are the stops and edges link the stop to its next possible stops regardless of passenger ows among them While the goal of graph pruning is to remove invalid edges and nodes according to the proposed criterion Graph Building Given the bus route OD their locations are rstly used to narrow down the choice of valid candidate stops only the candidate stops lying between them are under consideration For each stop within the range we determine links to its next possible stops according to the proposed Criteria 1  4 As Criteria 5 is related to all stops in one bus route so we use it to prune the routing graph after it is built Fig 6 left shows an illustrated example about a generated bus routing directed graph Graph Pruning Some nodes and edges can be further pruned because they are not useful for valid candidate bus route selection To be speciìc for nodes without in-coming edges if not origin or out-going edges if not destination 229 


 Fig 6 A bus routing directed graph for a given OD as they will not form any valid routes with the bus route OD pair these edges and nodes should be deleted We rst calculate all the nodes in-coming and out-going degrees And nodes exclude the given OD and corresponding edges would be iteratively deleted from graph if their incoming or out-going degree is zero At last graph with only one zero in-coming degree given origin and one zero outgoing degree given destination would be generated After graph pruning all the bus routes starting from the source and following the edges in the graph would eventually reach the destination Fig 6 right displays the resulted graph after applying pruning to the graph in Fig 6 left C Automatic Candidate Bus Route Generation Probability based Spreading Algorithm Though we have removed invalid nodes and edges through graph pruning the problem of enumerating all possible routes from given source to destination is proved to be NP hard Indeed it is also unnecessary to enumerate all possible routes and compare them all because most of routes are dominated by few others D EFINITION 1 We say R i dominates R j iif 1 T  R i   T  R j  2 Num  R i  Num  R j   where T and Num are the total travel time and number of expected delivered passengers which is computed based on Eq 3 and 4 T  n  1  i 1 tm  s i 1 s i   n  2  t 0 3 Num  n  i  j  j>i  fm  s i s j  4 where t 0 is the bus waiting time at each stop and we set it to 1.5 minutes The deìnition is similar to the skyline routes in and the rational behind is that only routes with less travel time but larger number of passengers should be selected Skyline detector will prune the routes which are dominated by skyline routes in the candidate set Thus the comparison can be done among detected skyline routes  The key idea of our proposed probability based spreading algorithm is to randomly select the next stop among the possible candidate stops in each step where the candidate stops having high accumulated passenger ow with previous stops are given high probability for random selection We describe the approach in Algorithm 2 The spreading starts from the given source Line3 The next stop in the candidate  Algorithm 2 Probability based Spreading Input G  S E   ow Matrix Output R  1 R   2 Repeat 3 currentR  s 1 4 Choose the next stop s  i with respect to currentR according to Eq 5 5 R  currentR  s  i   operation appends s i to currentR 6 Repeat Lines 4  5 Until s  i  s n 7 R  R R 8 Get corresponding skyline routes R  9 Until R  keeps unchanged route is chosen based on Eq 5 P  s  i  s 1 s 2   s j    j m 1 fm  s m s  i    S   i 1  j m 1 fm  s m s  i  5 where fm  s m s  i  is the passenger ow from s m to s  i  and S  contains the next possible stops of s j child nodes of s j in routing graph We can see the selection of next stop in the candidate route is not only determined by the current stop but also all the previous stops The output of this algorithm is one candidate bus route with the number of stops associated with the number of spreading steps The spreading would be terminated when the given destination is reached Line6 For each run we get either a repeated route or new route thus the candidate route set R would increase as the spreading algorithm is activated Then a question arises how many times are sufìcient to run the spreading algorithm and get the best results  Based on Deìnition 1 about the skyline routes we should consider if the skyline route set R  remains changed or unchanged Theorem 1 below ensures that when the skyline route set stays unchanged with the increase of spreading algorithm runs then the best route has been discovered Theorem 1 R  1 and R  2 are the detected skyline routes from R 1 and R 2 respectively If R 1 R 2  then we have 012 R i  R  1   R j R  2  R i  R j or R i is dominated by R j  In Algorithm 2 we have R t 1 R t 2 if the running time t 1 t 2  and the algorithm would be stopped when no better skyline routes are returned with the increase of running times that is R  t 1  R  t 2 Line9 Instead of choosing only one stop randomly at each spreading step like in the probability based spreading algorithm  an intuitive way is to select topk stops each time where those k nodes should have highest accumulated passenger ow with previous stops In such a way the rst step selects topk nodes thus leading to k routes from the origin to those nodes In the second step each k nodes would select another topk nodes thus the total candidate routes would be k 2  Assume reaching the destination needs n step spreading then the total candidate routes generated would be k n in the end We use this topk spreading method as the baseline D Bus Route Selection Given the bus operation frequency once every 30 minutes and the taxi passenger ow from 21:30 to 5:30 we obtain the 230 


     Fig 7 Comparison results with k means Results got by k means left and results got by our method right candidate bus routes for a given OD pair and maximum travel time using the two different heuristic spreading algorithms the skyline route which achieves the maximum expected number of passengers will be selected as the operating route With the planned bus route consisting of the selected bus stops the next step is to nd a physical bus route in the real setting which consists of road segments The selection of each road segment is done by following the dense and ne trajectories of taxis if they allow buses to operate Otherwise similar bus routes near the planned ones can be adopted as a reìned solution V E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION Here we validate the proposed approach with a large-scale real-world taxi GPS dataset which was generated from 7,600 taxis in a large city in China Hangzhou for one month with more than 1.57 million of night passenger-delivering trips A The Identiìcation of Candidate Bus Stops We compare the bus stop results generated with our method with that generated by the popular k means clustering method We set k  579  which is the same as our method We adopt the Eulerian distance as the similarity metric The centroid of each cluster is selected as the stop Fig 7 shows the comparison results Comparing with the popular k means approach our proposed candidate bus stop identiìcation method has two advantages 1 the centroid of each cluster got by k means is the average location of all its members and it may fall into non-reachable places like river as highlighted by the green circle in Fig 7 left In our proposed method both hotness and connectivity of each grid cell is considered for bus stop location selection and the selected bus stops are meaningful and stoppable places 2 Several identiìed stops by k means fall into a small area highlighted by the blue circles as the size of clusters got by k means is very different while our proposed method generates candidate bus stops that are evenly distributed in the hot areas which meets better the commonsense design criteria of bus stops B Evaluation of the Probability based Spreading Algorithm We evaluate our probability based spreading approach We rst show the convergence of the proposed algorithm Then we perform a quantitative statistical analysis of all the candidate routes generated for three given OD pairs We will also give the computed skyline route results Finally we validate that our proposed bus route generation approach outperforms the                     Fig 8 Convergence study of the proposed spreading algorithm TABLE I D ETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT STUDIED OD PAIRS OD Pairs Distance  km  Number of Stops 1 ZJU Railway 5.70 104 2 Railway East Railway 5.86 75 3 East Railway ZJU 8.80 144 baseline approach Table I shows the details of three OD pairs for night-bus route design experiment where more than 70 candidate bus stops are in the candidate bus route selection list 1 Convergence Study As illustrated in Algorithm 2 our proposed bus route generation process would be terminated if the resulted skyline routes keep unchanged We study the similarity of consecutively generated skyline routes from 5,000 to 150,000 runs with a constant interval of 5,000 runs We measure the similarity  sim  of two sets A and B as follows sim  A B   A 015 B   A  B  6 The similarity results of the consecutively generated skyline routes with a 5,000 run interval are shown in Fig 8 the time cost is put in the diagram as well In this study we can see sim values gradually reach 1 with the increase of runs for all three OD pairs meaning that in all three cases the best bus route converges to one Also the time cost is almost linearly increased with the number of runs suggesting that the spreading time cost at each run is almost constant It is also noted that the three curves for three OD pairs have different slopes the reason is probably because the bus routes corresponding to different ODs have different lengths and varied number of candidate bus stops thus the spreading time and candidate bus stop selection time should be also different 2 Candidate Routes Statistics Fig 9 shows the statistical information about the number of stops of candidate routes Several interesting observations can be made  For OD pair 1 routes with 8  10 stops take up over 80 of the cases both origin and destination are included Few routes can reach the destination by traversing only 4 stops or passing more than 11 stops  For OD pair 2 over 60 of the routes contain 9 or 10 stops Similar to the case of OD pair 1 some routes can reach the destination by passing 4 stops  For OD pair 3 most of the routes contain 10 to 18 stops due to the longer OD distance and almost half of the 231 


             Fig 9 Statistical information about candidate route stops for 3 OD pairs    Fig 10 Detected skyline routes and other candidate routes routes include 13 or 14 stops  The statistical results comply with the intuition that the longer distance of a given OD pair the more stops the route would contain 3 Skyline Routes We show the skyline routes for the OD pair 2 in Fig 10 Each point in the plane represents a candidate route The x-axis stands for the total travel time of candidate route while the y-axis represents the expected number of passengers From Fig 10 we can see that the skyline routes are connected to form a curve above all the points representing common routes and over 99 of the routes are dominated by the few skyline routes Speciìcally we get 40 skyline routes across all the travel time frames out of hundreds of thousands of routes for the case of OD pair 2 Similar phenomena have been observed for other two cases as well 4 Comparison with topk spreading algorithm In topk spreading algorithm the selection of k is vital to the skyline routes generated as well as the time needed to generate all the candidate routes In particular when k 1 k 2 wehave R k 1 R k 2  k 1  k 2   Theorem 1 guarantees that a bigger k would lead to a better set of skyline routes However the greater k also results in signiìcantly increase of time cost We compare the skyline routes generated from the probability based spreading method with that from the topk spreading method with different k value which is shown in Fig 11 We can see that the probability based spreading approach outperforms the topk algorithms even when k is set to 5 C Comparison with Real Routes As the taxi GPS dataset we have was collected from April 2009 to March 2010 we are very interested in knowing if there was any new night-bus route created during this year and how the planned bus route generated with our approach compares with the manually created route Fortunately we were told that a night-bus route was created in February 2010 we could   Fig 11 Comparison results with baseline under different k values access all the taxi passenger ows before the route started date It is noted that the route is designed by local experts and the user demands are obtained from expensive human survey We rst draw the newly started night-bus route on Google map as shown in Fig 12 left bottom then we draw our proposed night-bus route R 1 in Fig 12 left top Through comparison we see that they are quite different With the newly started route we decide to take a similar route in our selected candidate bus routes not the best one and we nd R 2 as shown in Fig 12 left top It is noted that the main difference between R 2 and the newly started route is that R 2 includes an additional Stop J in the route By comparing the passenger ow in segment I  K with that in segment J  K at different time slots it is found that the passenger ow in path J  Kis even greater than I  K in the rst two time slots as shown in Fig 12 right top Considering further the accumulation effects including Stop J in the bus route would signiìcantly increase the expected number of passengers along the route Thus our candidate bus route R 2 would outperform the newly added bus route at the cost of adding one more bus stop and more travel time We also compare our proposed best route R 1 with the candidate route R 2  The difference between R 1 and R 2 lies in two different paths taken from C to H While R 2 passes the famous shopping street Yanêan Road in Hangzhou  C  E  F  H  R 1 traverses the famous night-club areas along the West Lake If we compare the number of passengers in R 1 and R 2  it can be seen from Fig 12 right bottom that the passenger ow of R 2 is heavier than that of R 1 only around 22:00 and it is much lighter soon after 23:00 With the rest of the stops being the same for both R 1 and R 2  there is no doubt about why R 1 has been selected as the best night-bus route If we take a closer look at R 1  R 2  and the newly started route as R 1 takes a much shorter route than R 2 and needs similar travel time as the newly started route does but R 1 expects much more passengers than R 2 and the newly started route thus it is reasonable to conclude that the selected night-bus route with our proposed approach is better than the current route-in-service in terms of travel time as well as expected number of passengers VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we have investigated the problem of nightbus route design by leveraging the taxi GPS traces which 232 


     Fig 12 Results comparison Planned routes top left Passenger ow comparison of two segments at different frequency top right Opened nightbus routes bottom left Number of delivered passengers at different frequency  R 1 vs R 2  bottom right is motivated by the needs of applying pervasive sensing communication and computing technology for sustainable city development To solve the problem we propose a two-phase approach for night-bus route planning In the rst phase we devise method to identify locations of the candidate bus stops with the passenger pick-ups and drop-offs as inputs In the second phase with the bus route origin destination and candidate bus stops as inputs we develop two heuristic algorithms to automatically generate candidate bus routes and nally we select the best route which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions On a real-world dataset which contains more than 1.57 million passenger delivery trips we compare our proposed candidate bus stop identiìcation method with the popular k means clustering method and show that our method can generate more reasonable and meaningful results We further extensively evaluate our proposed probability based spreading algorithm for automatic bus route generation and validate its effectiveness as well as its superior performance over the heuristic topk spreading algorithm Further more we show the selected night-bus route with our proposed approach is better than a newly started night-bus route-in-service in Hangzhou China This work is among our initial attempts to apply pervasive computing techniques in achieving better urban planning of smart cities With the constraints of the approach and the acquired data this work still has several limitations 1 Human mobility patterns uncovered by taxi GPS traces are biased and incomplete thus the designed bus route might not be the best considering the fact that taxi trafìc does not reîect the whole passenger ow and people taking taxis might not be willing to switch to public transport for various reasons 2 The work makes some assumptions in problem formulation and evaluation for example for bus stop determination we set the walkable distance as 500 meters and the threshold for cluster split and merge is 150 meters apparently the choice of those parameters would affect the results but a study of the parameter sensitivity is not provided due to the space limitation 3 Currently we only explore the issue of designing the best bus route for a given OD pair the proposed approach is still unable to tackle the design of a bus route network In the future we plan to broaden and deepen this work in several directions First we attempt to investigate the optimal bus route design with more real-life assumptions such as varied bus operation frequency and limited bus capacity Second we plan to study the impact of parameter change on the bus route design and the added bus route on the taxi services along the bus route Third we would like to develop practical systems leveraging on taxi GPS traces enabling a series of pervasive smart transportation services A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the shepherd Dr

15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
