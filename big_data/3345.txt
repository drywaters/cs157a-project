I I NTRODUCTION Association rules mining is an important problem in the data mining area and has a wide range of applications. It was 
Statistical correlation 
negative correlation, and its concept, calculating formulas and primary characteristics are defined. In order to conveniently use statistical correlation to cut redundancy rules, a fast association rules mining algorithm, called F-Fminer, is designed with two new data structures UFP-Tree and FP-Forest which use multi-trees structure to store data. F-Fminer adopts divide and conquer strategy to mine frequent itemsets for every UFP-Tree basing on deepth-first searching. It can be seen from experimentation that the method in this paper has greatly enhanced mining efficiency and reduced a lot of redundant rules than other classical algorithms

Fig 9 Flowchart of the GNP based data mining method order to get suitable parameters and increase the number of association rules stored in the pool All experiments were run on a real database that contains continuous attributes about VOCs Volatile Organic Compounds It consists of 10 attributes  A i  i 1  2  10  and 825 tuples In simulations the population size of GNP individuals is 120 The number of processing nodes and judgment nodes are 10 and 78 respectively We use 5   2 min  6.63 6  sup min 0  1  and 8   new  150  In addition the detailed conditions of extracting association rules in the simulations are as follows n ante  r  n con  r  012 6  n ante  r   5  n con  r   5  The probability of crossover and mutation are P c 15  78  P m 1 1  3 and P m 2 1  5 78 corresponds to the number of judgment nodes The number of changing the connections of the processing nodes at each generation is 5 The simulations were executed for 500 generations and 20 trials are studied here for all the experiments changing the random sequences All algorithms were coded in Java Experiments were done on a 1.50GHz Pentium M with 504MB RAM A Simu l ation 1 In this simulation when transforming each continuous attribute of the database into a fuzzy attribute the parameters    and  of the trapezoidal and triangular membership functions remain xed for all generations it means that for the transition from one judgment node to another in GNP individuals the xed membership functions are used for all generations As an illustration the original membership function for one attribute is shown in Fig 10 Fig 11 shows the number of association rules extracted in the pool It is shown from this gure that the number of rules increases gradually as the generation goes on However the performance is not so good compared with Simulation 2 where the membership functions are also evolved Fig 12 shows the average tness values of the GNP individuals They remain almost at the same level during all generations B Simu l ation 2 In this simulation the parameters    and  of the membership functions are evolved using non uniform mutation Fig 10 An example of the original fuzzy membership function Fig 11 Association rules stored in the pool when membership functions are xed Fig 12 Average tness value of GNP individuals when membership functions are xed it means that for the transition from one judgment node to another in GNP individuals evolved membership functions are used in every generation Fig 13 shows the number of association rules extracted in the pool while Fig 14 shows the average tness values of the GNP individuals It is found that both the number of rules extracted and the average tness value increased compared to Simulation 1 It shows that the evolution of the membership functions generation by generation is helpful for extracting many rules and for improving the performance of the GNP individuals’s tness value Fig 15 shows the evolved membership function of Fig 10 In this simulation the pool of the association rules is updated in every generation exchanging an association rule with lower  2 value for the same association rule with higher  2 value as a result association rules are stored with the parameters of the evolved membership functions 17 62 2008 I EEE Co n g r e ss o nE vol uti o nar yCo mputati o n C E C 2008

evolved fuzzy membership function VII C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we have proposed an association rule mining algorithm based on Genetic Network Programming and Fuzzy Sets Theory to extract association rules from databases with continuous values Extracted association rules are stored in a pool all together through generations in order to nd new important rules The pool is also updated in every generation exchanging the same association rule with lower  2 value for higher  2 value These rules are reﬂected in genetic operators as acquired information Our method measures the signiﬁcance of association rules using conﬁdence support and  2 test We have performed experiments and estimated the performances of the proposed algorithm The results have shown that the proposed method extracts important association rules effectively in short time Adjusting the membership functions according to the frequency of the attributes stored in the pool in order to nd the most

5 Related Work There exists extensive previous work on both the mining of software repositories and on the use of clustering algorithms in software engineering This discussion focuses on the most similar and recent work in the area of software evolution Mining Software Repositories Our technique was partially inspired by the work of Zimmermann et al and Y ing et al 17 on the mining of association rules in change history As described in Section 1 we sought to expand the technique to be able to recommend larger but less precise clusters of elements to guide program navigation Bouktif et al also investigated how to recommend cochanges in software development As opposed to the work cited above Bouktif et al used change patterns instead of association rules Also their approach does not attempt to reconstruct transactions and can consider associated 002les that were changed in different transactions ChangeDistiller is a tool to classify changes in a transaction into 002ne-grained operations e.g addition of a method declaration and determines how strongly the change impacts other source code entities Our approach uses similar repository analysis techniques but is focused on providing task-related information as opposed to an overall assessment of a system's evolution Finally repository mining can also be used to detect aspects in the code In this conte xt aspects are recurring sets of changed elements that exhibit a regular structure Aspects differ from the clusters we detect in the regular structure they exhibit which may not necessarily align with the code that is investigated as part of change tasks Clustering Analysis The classical application of clustering for reverse engineering involves grouping software entities based on an analysis of various relations between pairs of entities of a given version of the system Despite its long and rich history  e xperimentation with this approach continues to this day For example Andreopoulos et al combined static and dynamic information K uhn et al used a te xtual similarity measure as the clustering relation and Christl et al used clustering to assist iterative semi-automated reverse engineering The main dif ferences b e tween most clusteringbased reverse engineering techniques and the subject of our investigation is that the entities we cluster are transactions rather than software entities in a single version of a system For this reason our analysis is based strictly on the evolving parts of the system Both Kothari et al and V an ya et al 15 recently reported on their use of clustering to study the evolution of software systems The idea of using change clusters is the same in both works and ours but the purpose of the work is different Kothari et al use change clusters to uncover the types of changes that happened e.g feature addition maintenance etc during the history of a software system Vanya et al use change clusters which they call evolutionary clusters to guide the partitioning of a system that would increase the likelihood that the parts of the system would evolve independently In contrast we cluster transactions based on overlapping elements not 002les to recommend clusters to support program navigation as opposed to architectural-level assessment of the system Finally Hassan and Holt evaluated on 002ve open source systems the performance of several methods to indicate elements that should be modi\002ed together This study found that using historical co-change information as opposed to using simple static analysis or code layout offered the best results in terms of recall and precision The authors then tried to improve the results using 002ltering heuristics and found that keeping only the most frequently cochanged entities yielded the best results As opposed to our approach the evaluated 002ltering heuristics were only applied on entities recovered using association rules and not using clustering techniques The focus of their study was also more speci\002c as they recommend program elements that were strictly changed  as opposed to recommending elements that might be inspected by developers 6 Conclusion Developers often need to discover code that has been navigated in the past We investigated to what extent we can bene\002t from change clusters to guide program navigation We de\002ned change clusters as groups of elements that were part of transactions or change sets that had elements in common Our analysis of close to 12 years of software change data for a total of seven different open-source systems revealed that less than 12 of the changes we studied could have bene\002ted from change clusters We conclude that further efforts should thus focus on maximizing the quality of the match between the current task and past transactions rather than 002nding many potential matches Our study has already helped us in this goal by providing reliable evidence of the effectiveness of some 002ltering heuristics and useful insights for the development of additional heuristics Acknowledgments The authors thank Emily Hill and Jos  e Correa for their advice on the statistical tests and the
