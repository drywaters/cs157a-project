Volume of seismic data instances deduced for structu ral interpretation\is used for modeling multidimensional data structures in a warehouse environment Several business rules \(constraints are applied to the design and development of a data warehouse. Seismic-time horizons, welldata, reservoir properties and petroleum production as data dimensions or classes and their associated attributes, have been used for integrating and modeling their data instances with numerous hierarchies. Ontology addresses issues of semantics and contexts \(naming conventions business rules and building relationships among several hierarchies. Business rules inform the data integration and data mining process, especially wh en heterogeneous data structures are denormalized for fine-grained data structuring and facilitate the association rule mining proce ss. Several data views have been presented for analyzing the effectiveness and deliverability of warehouse-modeled information. Design of business rules combined with fine grained ontology structuring appears to have a definitive impact on data mining of seismic data instances, enhancing seismic data knowledge and improving geological interpretation. Petroleum ontology proves to be an effective knowledge mapping tool, which can revolutionize the petroleum exploration industries Abstract

Exploration ontolo Basin The generation and recording of seismic data involve several issues.

A source \(source or shot dimensions\uch as a vibrator unit, dynamite shot, or an air gun \(array of shots generates acoustic or elastic vibrations that travel into the Earth, pass through strata with different seismic responses and filtering effects, and return to the surface to be recorded as seismic data. Ontology maintains optimal acquisition of restructuring data-array patterns and adapts according to local conditions. It involves employ ing the appropriate source type and intensity, optimal configuration of receivers, and orientation of receiver lines with respect to geological depthdomain features and required seism ic signals in seismic timedomain. This ensures that the best signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved with appropriate resolution 3] and extraneous effects such as air waves, gr ound roll, multiples and diffractions, all sources of unwanted noise, are minimized distinguished, and removed th rough processing.

Large volumes of data sets are loaded and distributed among PC and Unix/Linux based workstations for processing and interpreting the petroleum exploration data.

One popular structure is a starschema, logically stored in a warehouse environment for data integration, addressi ng the interoperability issue. These data organized in 2D/3D grids are spread across an exploration area in vertical, horizontal and lateral dimensions.

This is indeed a revolutionary concept in the fields of exploration and development of petroleum fields, which has more future scope of commercial research 2 Data instances from CDP, COP, CRP, CSP dimensions can easily be structured and integrated in a warehouse environment for the purpose of interpreting seismic signals and their attributes as required by geologists, well planners, reservoir and production engineers 3 Framing of business rules, constraints among usage of attributes within th e integration process and design of business rules have definite impact on correlation and mapping and thus on data mining 4 Ontology based data structuring has definite advantage, especially when attributes and their relationships are conceptualized using appropriate semantics and contexts 5 Integrating on tologically structured data in a warehousing environment has more flexibility and consistency in attribute mapping and interpretation during data mining stage 6 Structural data views taken from implemented warehoused metadata fo llow definite structure shapes, in terms of seismic high and low data instances, depicting geological knowledge 7 Integration of exploratio n data, modeled from different hierarchically derived multiple dimensions; facilitate the data mining process thus extracting knowledge of commercial petroleum plays. Issues of reuse and interoperability of denormalized fine-grained exploration data structures have also been emphasized in the context of implementing ontology based warehousing in petroleum exploration industries This research work addresses new methodologies, which have the potential to revolutionize the exploration and resources industries worldwide This is an on-going commercial research work at Curtin Business School Curtin University of Tech nology, Au stralia.

Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
