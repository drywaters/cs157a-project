There are many ways to analyze  these huge dataset s ranging from completely manual approaches to fully automated methods of detection  en-US Automated vocalization  detection and classification of fauna in recordings has been the subject of much research  There are many examples of sing l e species detectors  en-US 3 5 en-US   few er al gorithms capable of detecting multiple species  en-US 6 en-US  and some examples of general purpose tools capable of general audio data  analysis  en-US 7 9 en-US    en-US However automated methods of analysis are not perfect They can suffer high rates of false positives and false negatives  en-US 10 en-US  en-US 11 en-US   and  are time consuming and expensi ve to develop   E xtracting good training sets  is particularly time consuming   requir ing  extensive tuning and adaptation for different environments  en-US 10 en-US  en-US 12 en-US    en-US An alternative approach to automated methods is to  use crowd based methods of analysis  T he idea is that it is possible to outsource a complex classification task to a crowd of interested participants  I n these scenarios  t echnology can be used  to assist with  the  menial parts of  the analysis tasks We term this combination of  manual and automated approach es  as semi automated  analysis  V arying levels of automation and human participation result in a spectrum of methodologies that exist between  the two extremes   en-US In our research project we use a semi automated analysis methodology in addition to developing fully automated  methods of detection   en-US 3 en-US   Currently  in our semi automated system  participa nts analyze  data in a web interface  by playing back audio  collected from sensors. T he audio is played   along with a visual representation of the sound displayed at the same time This visualization  is a spectrogram   a time/frequency  audio  The spectrogram is currently translated left animated horizontally to screen left\ at a speed that is equivalent to the audio playing  approximatel y 45px/s   W e label this speed as real time \(or 1    Fig. 1 shows a  screenshot of this software   en-US The large amount of audio data that needs to be analyzed  places  strain on the limited resources of o ur volunteer participants As we observed our  participants  analyzing data  a unique  behavior  was noticed when participants were trying to identify only one  species  at a time They would rapidly  through each section of audio that was loaded into our online analysis tool  This scanning involved waiting for each 6 minute block to load   3MB of audio, 1MB of images dragging the seek/progress/navigation bar from start to end  at a speed they were comfortable with  s topping only when they found their target pattern  Accordingly, w ithout listening to the audio  a nd by  relying on the spectrograms alone to identify their target vocalisations  a participa nt  could process the 6 minute block in seconds This  ad hoc  method is suboptimal  due to the loading of redundant data and the limiting size of audio segmants that ca n be loaded at any one time   en-US To optimize  the process and determine  the degree of accuracy that can be achieved  this paper tests  this  ad  hoc   rapid scanning  method  of semi automated analysis  for viability   en-US A  The challenges of big acoustic datasets  en-US Our project   acoustic  sensors collect on average eight  days  worth  of audio data every day  Meanwhile semi automated analysis currently takes  a participant  approximately two  hours to analyze  an hour   of data   at reduced resolution  en-US 13 en-US   Hence i f we wish to scale our audio analysis   an increas e of  eff iciency in the analysis proces s  is required   en-US O ne limiting factor is the consumption of a udio data. Audio data is ideally  cons umed in real time   1   speed   Other speeds distort the sound resulting in a different interpretation of the original sound by a  human. However, a spectrogram since it is 


en-US only an  image  remains visually identical no matter what speed it is translated at   T he  limiting factor is the amount a participant  can perceive in an image with limited temporal exposure  en-US By  disabl ing  the audio and speed ing  up fast forward ing  the animation of the spe ctrogram s  there is  the potential to have  our participants analyze  the data  faster without a severe loss of accuracy   This  paper presents an experiment that tests the aforementioned  concepts for feasibility. If feasible, this paper will add anot her method for  semi automated data analysis to the existing toolbox of techniques  en-US II  R ELATED W ORK  en-US A  Related Citizen Science Work  en-US Galaxy Zoo  is  an example of a successful citizen science proj ect  that utilizes a crowd sourced  image classification model    similar to  the model we employ for  identifying pattern s  in spectrogram s The Galaxy Zoo project uses  their volunteers to classify  the morphology of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey by sh owing them images of the galaxies and asking them to pick a similar shape  en-US 14 en-US    Importantly  participants complete the tasks at their  own pace  and classification speed is not emphasized Instead Galaxy Zoo scales  out their analysis  by gathering large numbers  of active participants  A focus on faster classification times  would not wo rk well with the current versions of Galaxy Zoo, as the classification task asks multiple questions about each presented image  en-US WhaleFM  en-US 15 en-US   is a derivative of the Zooniverse project which operates Galaxy Zoo   Aga in  the core concept is to harness the collective intelligence of volunteer participants to analyze  images However WhaleFM differs in that it shows spectrograms of whale son g  to participants for classification into one of several classes. This is very si milar to  stated task  Whales create vocalizations  on the lower end of the spectrum of human hearing   t hus it is not always easy to hear them By visualizing  the  sound with a spectrogram image  it lets the participants match the image in their  own time not constrained to real time audio  T he WhaleFM paper by Saigh et al   en-US 15 en-US   s huffled the order of the spectrograms shown to the volunteers used in the paper    The paper did not reveal how lon g it took its participants to classify the whale song pattern s  Like Galaxy Zoo it ha s  multiple possible classifications for vocalizations making it potentially difficult to scale in speed  en-US A paper by Lin et al   en-US 16 en-US   demonstrate d  a sim ilar rapid analysis  technique. The pa per uses human participants to detect acoustic events of interest in spectrograms The user can jump to any point in the audio  stream and adjust the zoom of the visualization at the same time T heir study was conducted in order to bypass the time constraints of listening to and analyzing audio data. Additionally, the y  found that spectrogram s  were a good choice  for visualizing their data  because even untrained participants were capable of completing their assigned tasks of locating acoustic events  Participants were given 8 minute block s  of time t o identify as much content as possible  in 80 minutes of audio The spectrograms  are enhanced and  shown in a zooming style interface that allow s  participants to control the scale of the  spectrograms and thus  the  audio   that is shown  When identifying an event the user  has the option to playback the associated audio In practice  the authors stated acceptable results with their 10 speed increase  Importantly their experiment was unstructured   participants c hose where and when they stopped and listened to audio data  en-US B  Perception and Reaction times  en-US The w idely accepted minimum reaction time for visual stimuli in humans is about 200ms   en-US 17 en-US  en-US 18 en-US   However, reaction time slows when a choice needs to be made, as when classifying something  reaching 400ms and higher depending on the complexity of the image  en-US 17 en-US    en-US Biederman  en-US 19 en-US   states that image  processing  in humans is component based This means human s  are good at looking for shapes in images  like the sort of shapes often seen in spectrograms  The pap er also states that a s the number of components presented increases error goes up  Biederman s uggests  that  at least one second is required for  the  analysis of a degraded image A degraded image is defined as one missing parts like contours, surfaces, or other gaps  S pectrograms can be complex and vocalizations within can often be missing components  en-US Konishi et al   en-US 20 en-US   did a study on  brain activity for a go/no go task They  trained participants to respond within  a 300ms reaction time to a go no go  task press a button for positive or another negative for a simple visual stimulus  en-US Joubert et al   en-US 21 en-US   ha ve done several studies of times taken for participants to classify a scene Generally they flash an image up for a very short amount of time 20ms and see categorization  into one of two groups i.e. go/no go\ in around 400ms  en-US In summary the best reaction times cannot be less than 200ms for a classification task and an average of around 400 6 00ms  is expected f or  classification of an image  like a spectrogram   en-US  en-US Fig. 1  A screenshot of out current annotation software  


en-US III  E XPERIMENT D ESI GN  en-US This experiment should assess the viability of the rapid scanning methodology through the construction a new  and  appropriate  interface. To measure the net data processing speed the test interface will show different speeds and measure which settings result in the best analysis Ideally the experiment s hould attempt to understand how the rapid scanning methodology would scale The experiment must also be web browser compatible. Our existing analysis systems runs in an online environment and it would be ideal to integrate the work if it were feasible  en-US A s mall survey will also be issued to participants after they complete the experiment  en-US A  Limitations  en-US 1  Soundscape  en-US Vocalizations  of interest must be easy to identify by human participants   This means that the vocalization should be distinct and likely to occur  in moderately  empty audio signals  When  working with relatively empty  audio  signals it is still possible to have a complex and dynamic acoustic profile in  the  recordings. This variation is caused by a variety of non target acoustic features such as rain, wind, crickets, or complex non bioacoustic events When combined these arti facts can prevent simple automated detection techniques from working effectively   en-US The human component of the rapid scan methodology is what makes this idea feasible A human participant can intelligently distinguish between infrequent faunal vocalizations  and sudden intense  or complex periods of uninteresting audio However humans have limits of perception  and focus  Analyzing  with th e intent of classifying every species present at once or analyzing  in dense areas of bioacoustic events will overwhelm a human participant   especially when asked to do so quickly Thus  the rapid scan method is thought to be most useful for speeding up t he analysis of the sparse time consuming night section of an acoustic day  en-US 2    en-US Typically when analyzing  audio data participants are tasked with annotating vocalizations  Each annotation action involves drawing a bounding box around the p ortion of the spectrogram containing the vocalization  and then associating one or more textual tags with said bounding box  These annotations form the  core data output for this  research project   however, they are also time consuming to create The rapid sc an methodology is intended  to analyze  data rapidly If a participant were to stop every time they detected a vocalization  and then annotate it, the desired speed up in analysis would likely not be obtained  Instead of full annotations a simpler method of detection  was chosen   en-US Once points of interest are discovered  as hits  it is then possible to get a ny  participant to return to the data  later to properly annotate The rapid scan process still provides a service by filterin g out  the large sections of audio that contain no interesting vocalizations In other words, this is filtering with  human vision  to break up a time consuming task into components of work  en-US 3    en-US Ideally, there would only be a posi tive hit answer in the user interface as i t is all that is needed to complete the rapid scan task  E xperimentally this would  mean it is not possible to determine the difference between a participant failing to respond  and a negative response  Thus  a nega tive response  option  was included  to enable this information to be gathered   en-US 4  Disabled audio playback  en-US Enabling playback of audio for the rapid scan methodology was considered It would be ideal for participants to hear the audio data   it is a powerful disc riminator for distinguishing between signal  and noise Audio also helps explain spectral components  in the spectrogram  and  help s  to keep the task interesting  for participants  However playback of audio is constrained to a 1   speed   this is the very speed  constraint the rapid scan methodology is trying to avoid Any playback of audio would reduce the effectiveness of the rapid scan methodology  en-US B  Hypothesis  en-US Research question b y manipulating the animation speed of the spectrograms to make them display faster, will participants  be able to detect interesting acoustic events at an  increased speed  with a n  acceptable trade off in accuracy  en-US The null hypothesis  H 0  for this experiment is No  difference in accuracy will occur at different  exposure  speeds  The  alternative hypothesis H 1  for this experiment is That accuracy will be effected by speed of presentation such  that accuracy will decrease at higher speeds  en-US C  Experimental Interface Design  en-US Flash cards were chosen over  animated im age translation for simplicity   A flashcard is simply a card that shows information    they are often learned for memorization tasks We use the term flashcard in a digital sense to refer to a series of spectrogram images that are to be flashed past an  analyzer participant Flashcards  are simpler than a translation animation; they  simply need to be shown for some  duration and then  hidden again This means they do not move distractingly during viewing   allow ing  participant s  to scan according to  their  pers onal preference rather than forcing them to scan left to right   For  a  traditional  translated image approach  it is required to  animate not just one  image  but  neighboring  off screen  images as well in a demanding animation loop  A translating image approac h requires a concept of scale  pixels per second  and is inherently limited by the rendering capabilities of the browser often 60fps  en-US The amount of audio data shown with each flashcard was set to 24 seconds This amount  was chosen because a  24 sec ond spectrogram   fits well within most screen resolutions it is 1033px wide by 256px high The spectrograms are created with a 512  sample window and no overlap The duration  of  24 seconds also divides conveniently  into 120 sec onds    many  of the smaller recordings available are two minute long blocks of audio data  en-US A screenshot in Fig   2 shows the instructions page that was given to each  participant between each segment  of analysis When presented to participants animations emp hasized  core

The real time data was  used as the baseline  accuracy  measure   en-US F  Dataset s  en-US The data chosen f or  this experiment was taken from a project that deployed sensors located at   Queensland  Australia  latitude 20.914  longitude  149.442  This i sland has a population of K oala s   Phascolarctos cinereus   relatively unaffected by mainland Australia   making it a source of interesting research  en-US 22 en-US  Koala vocalizations w ere chosen because it is know n  that Koala usually  call  at night  en-US 23 en-US  Koala vocalizations are also easy to distinguish and identify   they are long, loud, and distinct  en-US Data was taken  from two different sites at St Bees  from 30/S ep tember 2009 to 16/Aug ust 2011  Recording timestamps span ned  from 17  00  through to 04  30   The sensors used were 3G phones that recorded 2 minutes  of audio every half hour   en-US For the experiment  three  datasets  one for each speed  totaling  66 minutes of data  22 minutes for each  dataset   were chosen   The idea was to provide  enough  data for each participant to complete  in order  to simulate what the experimental task  might be like at a large scale   balanced against the time constraints of th e participant s   en-US The r ecordings  were  included in their entirety unedited  into the dataset when a Koala Bellow was found. All sections chosen were  previously annotated so that reference data was available. T here were  a n unnatural number of positive hits in  the experiment  datasets  In a real world example  fewer  recording s  would have a Koala vocalization present  This experiment was  designed so that the presence of Koala vocalizations occurs approximately 50 of the time In actuality, vocalizations occur in 40% of the flashcards   en-US G  Segment Order and Randomization Protocol  en-US In the experiment it was  desirable that each speed was  tested  on each dataset   en-US If all the participant s  experience d  the varying speed tests in order   i.e. 5s, 2s, 1s\ they might have been  unfairly trained  for the faster speeds  To avoid a training bias, the combination of en-US   en-US  en-US TABLE I  S PEEDS TESTED IN EXPE RIMENT  en-US Speed  en-US Exposure time  en-US         en-US Slowest  en-US 5.0s  en-US 4.8  en-US Medium  en-US 2.0s  en-US 12.0  en-US Fastest  en-US 1.0s  en-US 24.0  en-US Fig. 2  Screenshots of the experiment interface.

en-US speeds was  set to be order important  Thus  the three  speeds produce  six  permutations  en-US Given three datasets, there were  18 possible combinations for the experiment. The combinations were  tracked and handed out evenly to each new participant of the experiment This ensure s  that the participants compl ete d  roughly the same number of  each the possible  segment  order s   en-US In each dataset, the order of the flashcards that are shown were randomized This ensured  that participants were  very unlikely to receive either a\ contiguous flashcards or b\ an order of flashcards that might  unfairly bias them e.g due to unintentional train ing    en-US IV  R ESULTS  en-US An error in storing the data on the experiment server  rendered s ome of the experimental  resu lts unusable This created a disparity between the number of survey results and the number of experimental results There were  46 experimental results and 73  survey responses  The corrupted experimental data was discarded and the remaining experimental res ults verified for integrity Since the survey responses are independent of the experiment data, all  of the survey responses were  used  en-US A  Main experiment overview  en-US A script for data manipulation processed the JSON files sent back to our server  from the website  The data was then subsequently analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2013 and verified by  SPSS Version 21   en-US Experimental results were collected from 2 April  2013 through to 21 April  2013 In total 73 experimental results were collected. Twenty seven experimenta l results were deleted due to data corruption, leaving  46  valid responses All  subsequent reports on  experimental data will include  only the data from the 46 valid experimental results  en-US Throughout the experiment period 7  728  flashcard s  were show n generating  8  023 hits   where a hit is a  decision  made about a flashcard  C hange s  in decision were  possible  meaning on average there was 1.04 hits per flashcard   A miss was  a flashcard that did not receive any hit Misses occurred in  512 7  of  flashcard s   en-US Given that each flashcard showed 24 seconds of audio data  51.52   of data  was analyzed  during the experiment  This analysis was completed with 7.02 hours of human effort   this  included   training time   pauses  breaks  between segments  and download time  Without pauses included   only minimal time was spent downloading spectrograms and reading the instructions for each segment The human effort spent  without pause breaks  of 6.01  hours   computed to an effective average exposure speed of 2.8 0 s flashcard  8.6  average across all speeds including training   The expected average exposure time across all flashcards was 2  5 5s flashcard  9.4     en-US On average each segment  order was completed 2.56 times  en-US B  Main experiment r esults breakdown  en-US This section reports    accurac ies  at different speeds Accuracy  is the statistic we used for summarizing  responses to flashcards. Accuracy is defined as  en-US          en-US 1  en-US  where a positive or negative was determined by the presence of a koala vocalization  and a true or false was determined  by marking a participant  s answer against the relevant flashcard Accuracy was chosen because it represented  the statistic we were  most interested in and because it was  not defined by false  cases This is useful because there were  two types of false  cases an incorrect decision and a miss    where a participant has failed to respond within the exposure time   en-US a  Consistency of Datasets  en-US As described three datasets were created for use in the study These datasets were then presented to participants at various speeds These datasets were presented  with their spectrograms randomly shuffled  Before testing the performance of participants at different speeds   it is important to confirm that no  difference in accuracy was found between datasets \(as this would indicate a confound resulting from the random allocation of spectrograms to each dataset\. To ensure no systematic error was unintentionally introduced into the study in the form of datasets  that were  more or less difficult to analyze  regardless of speed, inferential statistics were used to confirm that all datasets were equivalent  en-US There were ten outliers in the data as assessed by inspection of boxplots. In addition, accuracy was not normally distributed for each dataset as assessed by Shapiro  p   0 001 Thus, an ANOVA was  not a suitable test since its assumptions were  not met Instead a  Kruskal Wallis test was run to determine if there were differences in accuracy for f lashcards between datasets   en-US Initially the datasets were collapsed across speed  and compared No statistically significant differences were found between the three datasets  2 3 5.638   p   0  131, indicating that no dataset was more or less difficult to analyze  than any other Because a slightly different proportion of each datase t was used at each speed due to the final number of participants en-US TABLE II  SEGMENTS BREAKDOWN F OR EXPERIMENT RESPON SES  en-US Speed \(s  en-US training  en-US DS1  en-US DS2  en-US DS3  en-US SUM  en-US 10  en-US 46  en-US 0  en-US 0  en-US 0  en-US 46  en-US 5  en-US 0  en-US 14  en-US 17  en-US 15  en-US 46  en-US 2  en-US 0  en-US 15  en-US 15  en-US 16  en-US 46  en-US 1  en-US 0  en-US 17  en-US 14  en-US 15  en-US 46  en-US TABLE III  M ARKING STYLE  en-US  en-US Positive  en-US non ambigu ous   en-US Negative  ambiguous or non existent  en-US True  en-US TP  en-US TN  en-US False  en-US FP  en-US FN  en-US Miss  en-US MP  en-US MN  en-US TABLE IV  D ATA SET BREAKDOWN  en-US Dataset  en-US Instances  en-US Accuracy  mean   en-US SD  en-US Miss Rate    en-US training  en-US 138  en-US 0.80  en-US 0.26  en-US 0.06  en-US DS1  en-US 2530  en-US 0.80  en-US 0.16  en-US 0.06  en-US DS2  en-US 2530  en-US 0.79  en-US 0.19  en-US 0.07  en-US DS3  en-US 2530  en-US 0.82  en-US 0.19  en-US 0.07  


en-US in the study, further Kruskal Wallis tests were done between the datasets for each speed individually. These tests also revealed no significant difference between the datasets In sum as req uired to allow for a valid test of performance at difference speeds see below no difference in difficulty of datasets participant performance\ was found between the three  datasets  en-US b  Effects of speed on accuracy  en-US To determine the effect of exposure speed on accuracy and test hypothesis 1, a series of inferential tests were conducted A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in Accuracy over varying flashcard exposure speeds  en-US There were tw o outliers in the data as assessed by inspection of boxplots. One outlier \(accuracy = 0.16\ occurred at speed 2 where the user had stopped responding The other outlier accuracy  0.44 occurred at speed 5 where it seems the participant got the positive hit and negative hit responses mixed up. Both participants were removed from the dataset. To assess the assumption of normality, skewness and kurtosis values were calculated at each speed. All variables were found to be skewed The data was then transforme d with an arcsine sin 1  transform ation Skewness and Kurtosis values were then recalculated and found to be acceptable for all variables To allow for the violation of the assump tion of normality all analyses  were conducted with both the transformed and  the non transformed variables No differences were found in the pattern of results, so for ease of interpretation the results with the non transformed variables are reported below   en-US  Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicated that the assumption  2  2  35.125   p    0 0 01   Therefore a Greenhouse Geisser correction is a pplied     0 736\. Accuracy was statistically significantly different at the different speeds  during the experiment  F 1.277 54.893   16.864  p   0 00 1  2  0 282   Accuracy  decreased from 5s \(0.87 ± 0.01 to 2s \(0.85 ± 0.18\, to 1s \(0.73 0.21\, in that order  Post hoc  analysis with a Bonferroni adjustment revealed that accuracy  statistically significantly decreased  from the 2s speed to the 1s speed \(0.12 \(95% CI, 0.201 to 0.042 p   0 001 Additionally, accuracy statistically significant ly dropped from the  5s speed to the 1s speed \(0.15 95% CI, 0.069 to 0.227 p   0 001 However there was no significant increase in accuracy from the  2s speed to the 5s speed \(0.03 95% CI 0.07 0  to 0.060 p   0 170  en-US c  Summary  en-US The results from the re peated measures ANOVA allow ed  us to reject the null hypothesis that accuracy is the same across all speeds. Furthermore, operating at speed 2 produces an accuracy that is not significantly different than operating at speed 5; thus accuracy is kept with the  faster 2s speed.

The best speed  can  then be used to determine viability  en-US A  The best speed  en-US The main experiment quantitatively showed that of the three speeds tested, there was a significant drop in accuracy for only the fastest speed   1 s \(24   when compared to the other speeds   en-US For the 2 s \(12×\ & 5s \(4.8×\ speeds there was no significant difference in accuracy among the participants  This means the re  is no significant drawback  in accuracy  for tasking participants to operate at a 2s speed over 5s  en-US Additionally the miss rate for participants at speeds 2s and 5s were 5 and 1 respectively  For the 1s speed this rate jumped to 14  These misses were  partially explained by a single  participant th at declined to answer  for negative flashcards for the 1s speed only   that account ed  for 0.8% of  flashcards  en-US B  Hit distributions  en-US The hit distribution data   F ig   3 provides insight into when in the exposure period users were  responding   en-US T he median responses for all three experimental speeds were  between 500ms  and 800ms    approximately what the literature suggested it should be  As the speed increased  the median hit time decreases We speculate that the increased speed is forcing th e participants to lower their average reaction time  en-US When the  tails of hit distributions  were compared   we see that f or  speed 1, at its  upper bound, the histogram shows a non zero value of 2.5 This  mean t  that on average a group of participants was  not responding within the time constraint. For the 2s  and 5s speeds, the histograms demonstrate a more relaxed tail of diminishing responses The last data point for 2s is at 0.002% of hits and the 5s speed actually hits zero   indicating all users had finished responding within the time constraints The difference in completion of hits within the allotted time between 2s and 5s was  negligible  0.002 This means, that the extra three second s of time between the speeds is wasted given all responses can be accounted for without the extra time  en-US Finally the red line on the hit distribution graph represents the upper  bound of human reaction time performance  200ms  Discussed in the related wor k section, it is extremely unlikely to see a legitimate response within the first 200ms of exposure of a flashcard We speculate any hits that occur within this 200ms period are invalid either caused by panic or delayed  reactions   i.e. a participant  dec ided  how to classify a card too late  and accidently responded  to the next flashcard in the sequence   With the 2s and 5s speeds only a very small percentage of hits occur red  within this first 200ms 0.5% for 5s and 2% for 2s \(cumulative where t < 200ms\. H owever, for the 1s speed the cumulative hits reach ed  8  t  200ms  This means, of the 2530 flashcards shown there were 202 r esponses for  which it is impossible for them to be legitimate   en-US Tying the miss rate \(14%\in with the impossible response time rat e \(8%\for the 1s speed    rate for speed 1   much higher than speeds 5  or 2  1.5% & 7  minimum error rates  respectively    en-US C  Survey data  en-US The qualitative  data  received from the survey produced a wide range of results Gender was roughly split a ge  was en-US TABLE VI  A GE AND V OCATION B REAKDOWN  en-US Age  en-US Percentage  en-US  en-US Qualifications  en-US Response  en-US 18  en-US 0.00  en-US  en-US High School Diploma  en-US 28.77  en-US 18  25  en-US 41.10  en-US  en-US TAFE Diploma  en-US 15.07  en-US 25  35  en-US 24.66  en-US  en-US Graduate Degree  en-US 28.77  en-US 35  45  en-US 12.33  en-US  en-US Post graduate degree  en-US 24.66  en-US 45  55  en-US 9.59  en-US  en-US Post doctoral qualifications  en-US 2.74  en-US 55  65  en-US 9.59  en-US  en-US  en-US 65  en-US 2.74  en-US  en-US  en-US Fig. 4  Preferred speed from the experiment  and desired speed for long amounts of work  en-US  en-US 0 en-US 20 en-US 40 en-US 60 en-US 80 5 3 2 1.5 1 1 faster slower Percentage of respondants Speed Desired Speed Experiment Speed 


en-US skewed towards the 18 25 bracket, and vocation was roughly  evenly  distributed Importantly, 45% of respondents indicated they do not recreationally look for wildli fe This means a reasonable number  of novices participated in the experiment  Novices completing this experiment is ideal, as it is desirable for the rapid scan methodology to show good results for any skill level, not just for experts  en-US Comments on the des ign and layout of the experiment were noteworthy and will be addressed in future iterations of the experiment However, ultimately, the most important responses were the speed preferences Of the speeds tested 70 of respondents indicated they preferred t he 2s speed wi th associated comments indicating  5s was boring, and 1s stressful When asked about their preferred hypothetical speed respondents answered most commonly with a range between 1.5s and 3s. Common requests included variable speeds  to suit thei r preference and ability    which would be ideal outside of  an experimental environment  en-US D  Viability  en-US Given that the 2s speed was  the best option of the speeds tested, it would be the ideal speed to use  in a production scale  flashcard analysis s ystem    en-US At the 2s speed   accu racy compared to real time is 83   Provided the requirements for rapid scan methodology are met see  the  en-US Limitations en-US  section  we argue that a 17  drop in accuracy is an acceptable trade off  for a 12 an order of magnitude increase in analysis speed   For Koala vocalizations  in particular, they often last 20 60 seconds, fading in, reaching a climax, and then fading out. This long call means as many as 5 flashcards could have instances of the one group of vocalizations    positive identification  is only necessary for one of the flashcards shown wit hin the vocalization  period  en-US VI  C ONCLUSION  en-US The experiment indicated the viability of rapidly scanning spectrograms for the basic identification of Koala vocalizations   A 12   2.0s exposure\ speedup is achievable with an acceptable trade off in accuracy  17   en-US Future work on the rapid scan methodology includes enhanced development of the interface  integration with our production  website, and subsequent testing with different forms of analysis  Subsequent experimental tests could includ e  testing   different species different times of the day variable  exposure durations noise reduced spectrograms spectrogram compression  length variation and different numbers of classifications per flashcard   en-US Additionally  we think  further study into  the concep t of a  double run analysis  of a dataset  is worthwhile  By analyzing each dataset twice with a rapid scan methodology  it might be possible to decrease the drop in accuracy significantly for  a trade off of half the effective speed  en-US Despite the results even  when processing audio data at 12   speed, any substantial data analysis is still time consuming for a participant   We think the rapid scan methodology will be most useful when combined with multiple analysis techniques. Such techniques  could  include  automa tic filtering of the data natural  integration with our current analysis  system   and some form of sampling methodology \(either random or smart  en-US R EFERENCES  en-US 1  J Haselmayer and J S Quinn A comparison of point counts and sound recording as bird survey methods in Amazonian southeast Peru The Condor vol. 102, pp. 887 893, 2000  en-US 2  M.

Threshold observe that the number of frequent subgraphs rst increases exponentially and then increases smoothly after an in”ection point emerges This is because frequent subgraphs with smaller size tend to have many extensions that are then able to be veri“ed as frequent subgraphs as well Nevertheless frequent subgraphs with larger size may not have many valid extensions with respect to the frequency threshold The position of the in”ection point relies on the frequency threshold Generally a small frequency threshold leads to a larger in”ection point Another interesting nding is that the number of frequent subgraphs drops superlinearly when we enlarge the frequency threshold Not surprisingly the size of their posting lists shown in Figure 10\(b follows the same trends to that of the number of frequent subgraphs The running time and the I/O cost for both MRFSE-J and MRFSE-E follow the same trends When reducing the frequency threshold we can nd that the running time in MRFSE-J increases more signi“cantly than that in MRFSE-E while the I/O cost is the exact opposite VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we studied the problem of ef“ciently supporting frequent subgraphs extraction in a distributed environment particularly using the MapReduce framework We presented a framework called MRFSE to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs on a MapReduce like platform such as Hadoop We introduced a equal size partitioning strategy in order to balance the workload We proposed an isomorphismtesting-free approach for generating new subgraphs by properly maintaining how frequent subgraphs are mapped within each graph Extensive experiments conducted on our in-house clusters demonstrate that the techniques built using proposed framework are scalable and ef“cient A

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 sub”ows and can also handle short ows with ef“cient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer sub”ows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large bene“ts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have suf“cient traf“c and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple re“nement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modi“ed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satis“ed 1 It doesnt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satis“ed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted traf“c through this path for the particular destination pre“x for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butter”y 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jelly“sh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance traf“c Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jelly“sh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple sub”ows and modulating how much data is sent over different sub”ows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by sub”ows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to ef“ciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet traf“c splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Traf“c engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic traf“c changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related traf“c engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy traf“c demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insuf“cient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of traf“c onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modi“cations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different traf“c patterns and show that it signi“cantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing sub”ows 69
