Abstract 
well as fundamental challenges for the research community This trend is inherently exciting for the development and deployment of cloud platforms to support research communities curate data The excitements stems from the fact that researchers can now have more access and discover more value in data establish relationships between bits and pieces of information from many types of data and collaborate with a diverse community of researchers from various domains Technically however platform providers must design their infrastructure in such a way that users can easily search nd share and seamlessly collaborate In this paper we present 
the architecture and design of a cloud platform and describe how a community of disaster response scientists could use the platform to curate data Motivation for developing the platform lessons learnt in overcoming some challenges associated with collaborative and cooperative cloud environments and future research directions are also presented The contribution of this research is in the eld of cloud infrastructure for supporting data curation activities and the sustenance of research communities for the utilization of information assets and cyber technologies Cloud computing Big data Data curation Scien

I I NTRODUCTION The exponential growth of big data represents a signiìcant trend in the cloud computing and data-intensive science era  2 This trend is lik ely to persist gi v en the f act that man and machines continues to produce large volumes of data at an unprecedented rate For example the IDC study  predicts that by 2020 the digital uni v erse will house 40,000 Exabytes of data Paradoxically the investment per gigabyte will drop from 2.00 to 0.20 by the same period Big data is characterized by what has come to be known as the 6Vs Volume Variety Velocity Veracity Visualization 
Value and technology pundits are still debating what is and what is not big data According to big data is enormous amounts of unstructured sometimes structured or semistructured data produced by high-performance applications falling in a wide and heterogeneous scenarios However argued that big data is less about data that is big than it is about a capacity to search aggregate and cross-reference large data sets In the authors view the value of big data comes from the patterns that can be derived by making connections between pieces of data about an individual about individuals in relation to others about groups of 
people or simply about the structure of information itself We posit that it is this  
 or the ability to support interconnections between applications data and people that make big data so appealing to the research community Just like the Repository of Repositories concept  with big data researchers can ha v e access to more data establish more relationships between various types of datasets from diverse sources and domains and collaborate with other big data researchers There is ample anecdotal and empirical evidence detailing the impacts of this big data tsunami for research communities 2 7 disaster response 8 9 economic and

what the characteristics are or know how should a cloud platform that support research communities curate big data look like Taking these research gaps into consideration the primary aim of our research is to answering the following question  To help use answer this research question we rst describe the architecture of the cloud platform for curating big data we are developing at the Information Services Platform ISP lab of the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology NICT Japan Then we discuss how scientiìc communities such as disaster response scientists are using the platform to curate big data The architecture employs standard cloud computing models but has extensive customized applications that we believe are vital for supporting collaborative development of big data information assets In describing the disaster response community we introduce the data curation model that shows how researchers check-in and check-out data from an information assets repository and continuously get involved in data curation activities The model encourages collaboration between data providers consumers and curators We hope that this exposition will contribute to the R&D debate surrounding cyber-related technologies with a speciìc focus on the architecture models and application of scientiìc computing in the cloud The data curation activities has the potential to increase our understanding about the community dynamics in an interconnected distributed and data-intensive research environment Furthermore we posit that this research could offer some useful insights for researchers manages and cloud and big data infrastructure and applications developers who are providing ubiquitous services for their users The rest of the paper is organized as follows In section II we discuss the background related work and clarify concepts we used in our research In section III we describe the architecture of the cloud platform we have developed to support disaster response scientists curate big data information assets We introduce the disaster response community in section IV and describe use cases that enable community members take full advantage of the platform functionality The data curation model that depicts collaborative development of information assets by the disaster response community is presented in section V In section VI we present the Web portal of the disaster response community and brieîy discuss the platform and community sustainability measures we are undertaking as well as research limitations We conclude our research in section VII II B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK The dawn of cloud computing and big data has produced a fundamental shift in the way data is being generated managed and utilized by research communities Scientist in all elds are increasingly querying and analyzing large datasets to help them make informed choices discoveries and bring about innovation However despite advances in technological infrastructure to support workîow management and collaboration and cooperation the management of data including its preservation and the coordination of research communities remains as challenging as ever Some of the challenges we face includes diversity both in terms of data and applications for processing and analysing data widening gap between researchers and data providers organizing and managing multiple and changing roles of stakeholders R&D institutions research labs companies governments etc data security and privacy policies and open standards to deal with the big data inîux Furthermore for the research community the situation is becoming rather too intriguing For instance even analyzing and interpreting a simple earthquake situation can affect many elds For example a researcher might need to use historic archives of past earthquakes for comparative purpose access satellite and geospatial data to map and visualize the affected region weather and climate data such as rain/wind forecasts mobile data from users in the affected region trafìc and medical data for the management of relief and evacuation personal records for the identiìcation of victims government policy economic data to count the cost of damage and recovery operations etc Part of the solution to these challenges might be for scientiìc communities to consider adopting good data or digital curation practices In broad terms deìned digital curation as involving maintaining preserving and adding value to digital research data throughout its lifecycle Data curation according to can be deìned as a means to collect organize validate and preserve data Lord et al deìned data curation as the acti vity of managing and promoting the use of data from its point of creation to ensure it is t for contemporary purpose and available for discovery and re-use Nevertheless Karen and Baker  recognized that data curation is not a static process but a set of repeatable activities focusing on tending data and creating data products within a particular arena such as disaster response Data curation proìles and toolkits have been employed in many disciplines to help scientists curate data A data curation proìle DCP shown in Figure 1 can be seen as an instrument that can be used to provide detailed information on particular data forms As such a researcherês DCP documents all the actions that might be needed to ensure full utilization and sharing of a particular dataset used in a given research context

This layer consists of customized web-based applications we have developed to support data curation The applications are accessible over the internet and made available as services on the platform Applications currently available to the disaster response community are the following 1  These systems are used by the ISP community to search and retrieve data and metadata for their research The systems use spatial temporal ontological geographical and citation correlations between datasets and visually display the search results to help scientists better understand the results of their queries 2  The data citation tool allows users 
A Software as a Service SaaS Search and retrieval systems Data citation tool 
Figure 1 An overview of a Data Curation Proìle However existing cloud and big data platforms offer little exibility in terms of supporting collaborative work or data curation activities In order address this shortcoming and support the disaster response community in their data curation activities we opted for Mediawiki because of its exibility ease of customization extensibility and superiority in supporting collaborating editing of web content Furthermore wikis are extensively used by the scientiìc community for collaborative research and annotation of data  Ho we v er  wikis in general ha v e their o wn dra wbacks e.g accessing and linking heterogeneous data sources which many hinder data curation Data curation on a wiki goes beyond collaboratively editing of data curation proìles alone It also involves providing users the tools they would need to enable them search for relevant data link other data sources to their DCP upload or register data for their own DCP and for other curators annotate texts make data citations track data provenance and discuss or talk about their research or data curation proìle\(s These activities can be mapped to a user data curation proìle in order to provide detailed information on particular data forms that are curated by the individual III A RCHITECTURE OF THE D ATA C URATION C LOUD P LATFORM The architecture of the data curation cloud platform aims to make it easy for the disaster response community described in more detail in section IV to curate data without needing to worry about the underlying technical details and the location of the data or services we offer Furthermore the community should be able to access our distributed data and services anytime any-where so long as the members Figure 2 Architecture of the community-based data curation cloud platform have access to a computer with a Web browser and Internet connectivity The disaster response community shown on top left side of Figure 2 is a special interest group or sub-community of the overall information services platform community The community uses the infrastructure for open collaboration data curation and collaborati v e editing of data curation proìles The platform architecture depicted in Figure 2 exhibits typical cloud service models commonly referred to as infrastructure as a service IaaS software as a service SaaS and platform as a service PaaS In addition we also offer on demand data as a service DaaS pointed out that DaaS users can either download or query data from different data assets through APIs and they do not need to fetch and store giant data assets and search for the required information in the data asset In what follows we summarize how the cloud service models are loosely mapped to our cloud platform infrastructure

to make citations and append the results to their data curation proìles 3  The community can use the data registry application to registry or upload data for their research 4  The community can use this tool to package and download whole or parts of information assets for use outside the cloud platform 5  This tool can be used by the community to curate datasets by combining two or more datasets e.g Temperature and rain data and importing the curation results back to their data curation proìle 6  The VDP tool allows data curators to check the provenance information of a particular dataset and assess the risk of linking that dataset with other data 7  Researchers can use the information assets issues tracker to view vet and discuss data quality issues 8  Discussion forums and mailing lists are provided to help the community coordinate and collaborate on their big data development activities This layer consists of the information services cloud platform installed on MediaWiki data and metadata archives These provide the environment for curating data HTTP request/response gateways gives the community on-demand access to resources data and metadata applications visualizations and data curation proìles The community can access data in the form of HTML XML audio/video text CSV etc The information technology infrastructure of the cloud platform consists of the Japan Gigabit Network 1 JGN-X node connected to our lab and physical and virtual machine VM servers with their respective operating systems A scalable and high-performance virtualization VMWare allows us to install and maintain multiple applications on a single physical platform Physical machines are sandwiched between rewalls and linked directly to the JGN-X network The infrastructure also contains engines and web APIs that handle visualizations simulations and I/O service requests to the data and metadata stored in archives databases IV T HE D ISASTER R ESPONSE R ESEARCH C OMMUNITY The objective of the information services platform ISP lab is to build a cloud platform that will support service consumers and providers in their use and provision of information assets The community-based cloud platform cater for the needs of a broad range of e-science 1 http://www.jgn.nict.go.jp/english/index.html Figure 3 Disaster response scientist Use Cases and data intensive science stakeholders The community is loosely sub-divided into subcommunities or special interest groups that collaborate and work on topics related to CyberPhysical systems knowledge language grid applications web archives and data citations and disaster response information assets This research focuses on the latter group with emphasis on disaster response scientists The function of the disaster response information asset group is to individually and collectively create information assets for analyzing situations and responses relating to target disasters e.g typhoons hurricanes earthquakes etc The user proìle of the group consists of disaster response scientists humanitarian relief organizations and volunteers and the general public who are just interested in obtaining and understanding shallow disaster situations Figure 3 depicts ten use cases for one member of the disaster response information assets group the disaster response scientist Dotted lines indicate cause-effect relationship between the use cases A detail description of each use case and how it is implemented on the cloud platform is shown in Table I As shown at the center of Figure 3 the use case is central representation of how we expect a disaster response scientist to interact with the cloud platform as well as the information assets on it On the platform a scientist can recently changed data curation proìles proìles that were cited most by other researchers and most cited datasets This use case will help users understand disaster situations being discussed by the community The scientist can login and edit or  or comment on any of the data curation proìle Any changes made additions/deletions can be tracked viewed and/or reverted through revision histories Furthermore a scientist can for particular disaster topics e.g earthquakes oods tsunamis keywords e.g heavy rain or datasets related to speciìc disasters in a

or existing information assets the scientist can his own topic to address contemporary or past disaster situations If the dataset is not available in the bid data repository the scientist can or upload datasets related to the disaster he is interested in In registering or uploading datasets users will be required to provide additional information e.g Name of asset and uploader date license brief summary describing the asset etc that will later be used to verify the of the information asset Using the information assets quality assurance issue tracker users can assess the of the information assets on the platform All platform users have access to forums and mailing list that they can use to reach-out to other users discuss about quality modiìcations and usage of information assets on the platform V C URATING B IG D ATA I NFORMATION A SSETS The data curation model in Figure 4 demonstrates how the disaster response community is involved in the process of curating data on the cloud platform The model contains three key components  Actors in the data curation process are 1 Data providers a disaster response scientist who can register or upload data to the cloud platform 2 Data curators disaster response scientist who can create a data curation proìle curate or combine two or more datasets and organize the information in such a way that others can understand a particular disaster situation For example a Figure 4 Data curation model scientist can combine correlate and create visualization of typhoon and twitter data to help other platform users have a gist of what people in the typhoon affected region are saying e.g where to nd shelter medical help evacuation spots etc 3 Data consumers disaster response scientists who just browse use case discussed above or lurk on the cloud platform to understand a particular disaster situation In this group of actors we also have data providers who are also consumers of their own data data curators who are also consumers of their own curated data and people who facilitate data curation activities on the wiki platform  As shown at the bottom of Figure 4 the cloud platform initially contains data assets such as sensor data science data social sensing data web data archives natural environment data e.g rain temperature disaster and trafìc data etc As of January 2013 the ISP lab archived 2.4PB of data and this is said to increase every three months or so  The cloud platform contains customized tools that allow the actors to search for disaster related datasets cite or make references by linking their work or proìles with that of others and with other datasets and tools for registering and curating datasets In the cyclic nature of curating data on the platform center of Figure 4 data is stored in the information assets repository in the cloud and can be accessed by actors on demand Actors or check-out datasets from the repository using customized tools They can cite the dataset embed it in wiki pages they are editing or curate the dataset using the data curation tool Actors can do this individually on their workspace or in collaboration with other researchers on the platform At this stage the dataset that was originally

or check-in the new and improved information asset to the information assets repository This cycle continues in perpetuity creating more information assets for the community Thus after many iterations we posit that the information assets repository with its 2.4PB of data will indeed contain more community generated big data VI I MPLEMENTATION AND D ISCUSSION As discussed in the SaaS layer of the architecture of the cloud platform gure 5 is a screenshot of the disaster response community web portal showing the customizations we added to the MediaWiki core With these customization tabs the group can discuss their data curation proìles or research activities in the designated wiki pages search the wiki using both the search systems and insert the search results into the wiki pages register or upload/download datasets to and from the platform Furthermore on the front page of the website visitors can see recently changed or curated proìles pages rank of data curation proìle pages with most citations and a rank of the most cited datasets in each data curation proìle The menu items on the left shows among others users can create their own data curation proìle using custom templates assess the quality of the information assets by clicking the IA Quality Control link and join the community mailing lists and data curation documentation and FAQs Currently the disaster response community consists of 19 members research scientists and engineers Together they have created 138 wiki pages in two weeks This community is involved in the testing and experimentation phase of the platform They community generated the initial wiki contents that could then be used to solicit further contributions from a larger community of users They revised and discussed the prototyped contents and collaboratively edited the sample data curation proìles The requests for improvements and enhancement led in by the community provided a feedback loop in our community development process Data curation practices are highly speciìc to individual communities and therefore may vary widely across communities such as disaster response library and information sciences and even in condense matter physics However while the context of this research is unique to our research environment we conjecture that the disaster response use cases and the cloud architecture with a 
import A Generalizability and transferability of ndings 
Figure 5 Web portal of the disaster response community showing custom data curation applications exported form the repository would have gone through many hands and is being improved upon along the data curation cycle in such a way that we can say it has more value and is of better quality than the original dataset that was exported from the repository Researchers can also select package and download whole or part of the curated data Alternatively they can altruistically

strong emphasis on the user community can serve as a starting point for eliciting functional and non-functional requirements for cyber technologies that provide ubiquitous services for users in general and scientiìc communities in particular Furthermore the data curation model can be easily transferred in another context or discipline to model data curation activities in other domains As far as supporting communities curate data is concern this research has certain limitations that must be mentioned Some of these issues include discussion on the maintainability and scalability of the platform how we guarantee the security and intellectual property of the big data information assets how the provenance of the registered and curated data are veriìed uniìed format for our registered datasets the metrics for assessing the quality of big data information assets licensing of the curated data and how to motivate the disaster response scientists taking part in the data curation process These are important issues that we hope will generate more discussions amongst conference participants VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we presented and discussed the architecture of a cloud platform that supports disaster response scientists curate big data information assets The architecture combines the exibility of cloud computing with extensive customization of MediaWiki While the architecture looks like any other cloud computing infrastructure we placed great emphasis on the community layer and discussed how the disaster response communities can leverage the SaaS DaaS and PaaS layers for their data curation activities We presented use cases for disaster response scientists and described how these are implemented on the cloud platform A data curation model was introduced to demonstrate how the collaborative development of data curation proìles could lead to the generation of more big data for the community In our implementation and discussion section we showed how the disaster response web portal was designed to meet the needs of data curation and what the disaster response community can do on the website Supporting scientiìc communities in their data curation activities is a complicated process that requires an interdisciplinary effort Despite some of the research limitations we mentioned working with the small community of nineteen testers shows that as a proof of concept it is feasible to design develop and maintain a platform that can support disaster response scientists curate big data information assets Agile software development is the hallmark of our effort to provide a sustainable cloud platform to support data curation in various domains We consider this research to be the beginning of a dialogue that will lead to better understanding of big data community dynamics big data community metrics and how to develop cyber technologies that can support research communities Research in the elds of cloud computing cloud resource management and allocation QoS big data infrastructure development scientiìc data management cyber-physical cloud computing data curation and digital libraries Open Source software development all have a role to play in this dialogue And the 5th International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery CyberC 2013 provides a fertile ground to begin this dialogue R EFERENCES  M J Bietz A W iggins M Handel and C Aragon Data-intensive collaboration in science and engineering in  2012 pp 3Ö4  R Heimann Big social data the long tail of science data  vol 28 no 1 pp 34Ö37 2013  J Gantz and D Reinsel The digital uni v erse in 2020 Big data bigger digi tal shadows and biggest growth in the far east International Data Corporation IDC Tech Rep December 2012  A Cuzzocrea I.-Y  Song and K C Da vis  Analytics over large-scale multidimensional data the big data revolution in  2011 pp 101Ö104  bo yd danah and K Cra wford Critical questions for big data Provocations for a cultural technological and scholarly phenomenon  vol 15 no 5 pp 662Ö679 2012  S K So we L Angelis I Stamelos and Y Manolopoulos Using Repository of Repositories RoRs to Study the Growth of F/OSS Projects A Meta-analysis Research Approach in  Springer 2007 pp 11Ö14  J Lin and D Ryabo y  Scaling big data mining infrastructure the twitter experience  vol 14 no 2 pp 6Ö19 Apr 2013  M W  A F  Ian Mitchell Mark Lock e Fujitsu Services Ltd 2012  I Shklo vski L P alen and J Sutton Finding community through information and communication technology in disaster response in  2008 pp 127Ö136  P  Hunter  Journe y to the centre of big data   vol 8 no 3 pp 56Ö59 2013  A Erdman D K eefe and R Schiestl Grand challenge Applying regulatory science and big data to improve medical device innovation

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
