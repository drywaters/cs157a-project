Privacy preserving data mining with unidirectional interaction Chai Wah Wu IBM T J Watson Research Center P O Box 218 Yorktown Heights NY 10598 U S A e-mail chaiwahwu@ieee.org Abstract  Privacy concerns over the ever-increasing gathering of personal information by various institutions led to the development of privacy preserving data mining Two main approaches to privacy preserving data mining have emerged in recent years The 036rst approach protects the privacy of the data by perturbing the data through a random process The second approach uses cryptographic techniques to perform secure multi-party computation While the second approach is generally viewed as superior due to its strong assurance of privacy there are reasons why it might not be appropriate in certain applications For instance in some cases the data collection phase usually does not allow for complicated processing such as ballots cast via short message service In other cases such as paper surveys the data 037ow is unidirectional from the survey taker to the survey collector The requested data is sent once with no further interaction In both these cases the complicated computations and iterative interaction between data originators and data collectors that are required for secure multi-party computation cannot be used We show how in these cases random perturbation of data can be a useful approach to privacy preserving data mining In particular we study a data perturbation scheme which was shown to have asymptotically small privacy loss and information loss We illustrate the ideas using an example of a privacy preserving paper-based survey where no computation is done by the users Finally we apply this method to privacy preserving association rules mining I I NTRODUCTION The proliferation of data mining algorithms to extract statistics and trends from large sets of data results in the need for data mining algorithms which preserve the privacy of the owners of this data In priv acy preserving data mining PPDM the goal is to perform data mining operations on sets of data without disclosing the content of the sensitive data In 1 a r e v i e w o f th e s tate o f th e a r t in th is r a p i d l y e v o lv in g  eld is presented Since the results of the mining tell us something about the data otherwise there would have been no interest in performing the mining some information about the original data is leaked to the mining results Thus the rst questions to be asked are how much privacy is leaked by knowing the mining results and what type of mining operations result in a small amount of such privacy breach In this paper we will not answer these questions as it can involve social and policy issues but assume that some form of mining is predetermined Thus there is a nontrivial baseline privacy breach under some suitable denition inherent in the data mining results Our goal is to determine what the algorithms should be to limit the actual privacy breach to be close to the baseline In this paper we consider the basic framework consisting of n users  each with a piece of data x i  The goal of the data mining agent is to compute the aggregate data h  f  x 1 x n  without having the users reveal what the exact values of x i s are The baseline privacy breach is the amount of information about x i that is inherent in the aggregate data h  We are interested in scenario s where there is no interaction among users and minimal inter action between the users and the data mining agent as is the case in surveys conducted over the internet for example Secure multi-party computation 2   4  h a s b een sh o w n to be an important component in implementing PPDM In this approach cryptographic techniques are used to allow a party to perform computation on a set of numbers without knowing the actual values of these numbers The computation usually involves several iterations of a protocol between the data mining agent and the users There are several scenarios why this approach is not appropriate First of all since some information about the values x i are leaked to the computed data h anyway it may be overkill to use cryptographic techniques to ensure zero privacy breach in the computation of h  This is especially true since cryptographic techniques are usually computation-intensive Secondly in some applications such as taking a survey using short message service SMS or paper questionnaires there is no interaction between the users and there is little interaction between the users and the data mining agent making it infeasible or impractical to use an iterative protocol The purpose of this paper is to study the usefulness of random perturbation to PPDM in these cases We rst restrict ourselves to the scenario where the goal of data mining is to generate an estimate of the distribution of the collected data points In this case the problem can be formulated as follows The data mining agent would like to construct an estimate of the distribution f X  x  of n data points x i from n users without actually knowing the values x i The n points x i are assumed to be i.i.d samples from a random variable X Inthe random perturbation approach t his mining is accomplished by having the users send modied values z i to the data mining agent and estimating f X  x  using only the values z i Two concepts quantify the performan ce of a PPDM scheme Privacy loss describes the amount of information about x i that is leaked to the data mining agent due to the transmission of z i  Information loss describes the additional loss of precision in estimating the aggregate data h due to the use of modied 5521 0-7803-8834-8/05/$20.00 2005 IEEE 


data z i instead of the actual data x i  Using a signal processing approach it was shown in  that the Expectation-Maximization reconstruction algorithm in  i s e qui v a l e nt t o appl yi ng t h e R i c hards on-Luc y debl urri ng algorithm to the histogram estimator Furthermore it was shown that simple addition of random noise i.e z i  x i  n i  where n i are i.i.d samples from a random variable Y s proposed in 7 can pre v ent t he di s t ri b u t i o n t o b e e s t i m at ed accurately depending on the spectral characteristics of f X and f Y  The tradeoff between privacy loss and information loss is exhibited in maximizing both the support of f Y and the support of the Fourier transform of f Y  A novel PPDM data perturbatio n scheme was also presented in w hi ch s o l v es t h i s probl em T he purpos e o f t hi s p aper is to study and extend this scheme and illustrate how it can be applied in a survey with paper questionnaires where the interaction is unidirectional In Section VI we apply this method to privacy preserving association rules mining II D ATA PERTURBATION SCHEME We summarize here the data perturbation scheme in  We assume that x i 001 R m  The range of X is partitioned into k regions R 1 R k  The measure of R i is denoted as m i  Let I R i be the indicator function of R i i.e I R i  x 1 if x 001 R i and 0 otherwise For each data point x i  construct the k vector 001  x i  1 m 1 I R 1  x i   1 m k I R k  x i  Wealso generate a k vector y i consisting of k i.i.d samples from a random variable W with mean   The perturbed data is then dened as the k vector z i  001  x i  y i  To estimate f X  x   we simply compute the average of z i and subtract   In other words let y ij and z ij be the j th component of the k vectors y i and z i respectively Then  002 j def 002 1 n 001 n i 1 z ij    1 m j n 001 n i 1 I R j  x i  1 n 001 n i 1 y ij   converges to 002 j def 002 1 m j n 001 n i 1 I R j  x i  as n 003\004 by the law of large numbers 1  Since a histogram estimate of f X is precisely 001 j 002 j I R j  this allows us to construct an estimate of f X  As the samples y i are generated independently there is no interaction between user s Furthermore the datum z i is sent from the user to the data mining agent unidirectionally with no further interaction This data ow is schematically shown in Fig 1 The perturbation random variable W is a discrete random variable on the natural numbers with distribution P W  j  a  1 a j 1 for j 0  1  where a 1  III P ROPERTIES OF DATA PERTURBATION SCHEME A Privacy loss Privacy loss describes how much information about x i is leaked through z i  We will compute privacy loss similar to  Let x i 001 R j  i  Given z i  we construct an estimate  003  i  of 1 If n is known and the y ij s are known by the trusted system designer but not the data mining agent then we can simply set  to be 1 n y ij andavery large n is not necessary User 1 Data mining agent User n User 2 Fig 1 Data ow between users and data mining agent in data perturbation scheme There is no interaction between users and data are sent once from the users to the data mining agent the value of j  i   the index of the region where x i belong Let P i  P  003  i  j  i   z i   i.e the probability that the estimate  003  i  is correct The privacy loss is then dened as L  001 i P  z i  P i  Let e j be the j th unit vector In particular if x 001 R j then 001  x  e j  Let us assume that  003  i  is the maximum a posteriori estimate MAP of j  i  i.e  003  i  arg max j P  001  x i  e j  z i  Now P  001  x i  e j  z i  P  001  x i  e j y i  z i  e j  001 j P  001  x i  e j y i  z i  e j   Recall that P W  j  a  1 a j 1 If z ij 0 then P  y i  z i  e j  0 Otherwise P  y i  z i  e j   a  1 k a z ij 002 k 001 002  j a z ik 001 1   a  1 k a  k  1 001 k 001 z ik 001  def 002 004 i which is independent of j Let J i be the set of indices j such that z ij 0 Since x i and y i are independent this means that 001 j P  001  x i  e j y i  z i  e j  004 i c i where c i  P  001  x i  e j j  001 J i   Therefore if j 005 001 J i then P  001  x i  e j  z i  P  001  x i  e j  c i  Thus  003  i  arg max j 001 002 J i P  001  x i  e j  Since P W 0  a  1 a  by choosing a close to 1  we can ensure that J i is small This in turn implies that P i and consequently the privacy loss is small as the number of regions increases and the measures of the regions R k decrease B Baseline privacy loss Let j b be the MAP estimate of j  i  knowing only f X i.e j b  arg max j P  001  x i  e j  Wedene Q i as the probability that x i is in R j b given z i i.e Q i  P  j b  j  i   z i  and we dene the baseline privacy loss as 001 i P  z i  Q i  Q i is always smaller or equal to P i  In particular Q i 0 if j b 001 J i and Q i  P i if j b 005 001 J i  This means that the baseline privacy loss is always smaller than the privacy loss If J i is empty then the privacy loss is equal to the baseline privacy loss Thus for a 006 1  the privacy loss is close to the baseline privacy loss C Information loss Estimating f X using the samples x i already incurs a error in determining f X  Information loss describes the additional loss in precision in estimating f X from z i due to the introduction of y i  In particular when y i 0  the information loss should also vanish which is not the case for the denition of information 5522

V T RADEOFF BETWEEN INFORMATION LOSS AND PRIVACY LOSS When the number of data samples n is small there is a tradeoff between privacy loss and information loss To get small privacy loss a should be chosen close to 1 Onthe other hand when a is close to 1  y ij have a larger variance and thus more samples are needed to limit information loss Furthermore for the scheme in Section IV-A v needs to be large when a is close to 1 in order for the privacy loss and information loss to be small Since the regions R i are independent the parameters a and v can be chosen to be different for each region This is useful in cases where the requirement of information loss is different for different regions VI P RIVACY PRESERVING ASSOCIATION RULES MINING The above method can also be used for privacy preserving association rules mining if the number of rules of interest is not excessive We use the denitions in Let I beasetof items Each users data is a transaction x i which is a subset of I  An association rule is an implication of the form A 012 B  where A 013I  B 013I and A 014 B  015 Therule A 012 B holds with condence c if c percent of the transactions that contain A also contain B Therule A 012 B has support s if s percent of the transactions contain A 010 B  The goal is to nd rules which have high support and condence To each rule A 012 B corresponds a 2 vector which maps a transaction x i as follows 001 R  x i  v 1 v 2  where v 1  006 1 if A 013 x i 0 otherwise v 2  006 1 if A 010 B 013 x i 0 otherwise It is clear that this scheme allows us to compute the support and the condence of the rule easily Summing the values of v 2 of all the transactions and dividing it by the number of transactions gives the support of the rule whereas the sum of v 2 divided by the sum of v 1 gives the condence of the rule To achieve PPDM these vectors are perturbed as before The same analysis as before shows that information loss can be made small if the number of transactions is large For r rules these 2 vectors are concatenated and each user sends a 2 r vector to the data mining agent Depending on the rules a shorter vector might sufce For instance for the 2 rules A 012 B and A 012 C  only a 3 vector describing membership of the sets A  A 010 B and A 010 C in x i is needed When I has p items and the rules of interest are all the rules a 2 p  1 vector is generated for each transaction x i  Each component of this vector is either 0 or 1 depending on whether each of the 2 p  1 nonempty subsets of I is contained in x i  VII C ONCLUSIONS We study the usefulness of random perturbation in privacy preserving data mining scenarios where the data ow is only from the users to the data mining agent For these scenarios secure multi-party computation which involves complicated processing and iterative protocols is not appropriate We study a random perturbation scheme suitable for use in such scenarios and where no computation is done by the users such as when a survey is conducted using paper questionnaires We show that the privacy loss and information loss can be made small in this case Finally we apply this scheme to privacy preserving association rules mining when the number of rules is not too large R EFERENCES 1 V S V e r y k i o s E B e r t i n o  I N  Fovino L P Provenza Y Saygin and Y Theodoridis State-of-the-art in privacy preserving data mining SIGMOD Record  vol 33 no 1 pp 5057 2004  Y  L indell and B P inkas  Pri v a c y pres erving data m i ning  i n Advances in Cryptology-crypto 2000  2000  W  D u a nd M J  Atallah Pri v a c y preserving cooperative scientic computation in 14th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop  2001 4 M  K antar c ioglu a nd C Clif ton P r i v a c y p r e s e r v ing d is tr ib uted m i ning of association rules on horizontally partitioned data in ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Research Issues in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  2002  C  W  W u Pri v a c y pres erving da ta mining a signal processing perspective and a simple data perturbation protocol in IEEE Workshop on Privacy Preserving Data Mining International Conference on Data Mining  2003 Available electronically at http://www.cis.syr edu 001 wedu/ppdm2003/papers/2.pdf   D  A gra w al and C C A ggarw al  On the d es ign a nd quantication o f privacy preserving data mining algorithms in Symposium on Principles of Database Systems  2001  R  A gra w al and R  S rikant  Pri v ac y-pres erving data m i ning  i n Proc of the ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data  pp 439450 ACM Press May 2000  R  A gra w al and R  S rikant  F a s t algorithm s for m ining a s s o ciation r ules   in Proceedings of the 20th VLDB conference  1994 5524

If the check fails, the statement cannot be executed. If they coexist in one or more AGs, the algorithm checks whether the method \223md1\224 can be invoked under the associations of the AGs the objects coexist \(by comparing the associations in the AGs with the ML of \223md1\224\ no association in the AGs is allowed to invoke the method, the statement cannot be executed. If one or more associations are allowed to invoke the method the algorithm identifies the common associations of the variables involved in the statement. If no common association is identified, labels of the statement are incomparable and the statement cannot be executed. If one or more common associations among the variables are identified, labels with any common association can be selected to check information flow security. If a common association causes the secure flow condition true, the information flow is considered secure. This consideration is reasonable. For example, if a worker is assigned to a manager and they are friends, the manager can play the role of either a manager or a friend to invoke the worker\222s methods  6. Case study  The example described in section 2 is revisited here We use the proposed model to label the application The labeling result is shown in Example 1. We simplify the example by hiding the possibly complicated structure of an attribute. For example the attributes \223general_info\224 of the object \223worker\224 may be as complicated as a C structure. Let\222s trace Example 1 to prove that the information flow control requirements described in section 2 are fulfilled Requirement 1 When a manager monitors a worker assigned to him, the manager can read the worker\222s general information, hour pay, and work hours This requirement is accomplished by the manager\222s method \223monitor\224 and the labels with the association \223assigned\224. To get the information of a worker, the manager\222s method \223monitor\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_info\224 using the manager\222s attributes \223worker_general_info\224 223worker_work_hour\224, and \223worker_hour_pay\224 as arguments. Comparing the label of 223worker_general_info\224 with that of the worker\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, the secure flow condition mentioned in section 4.4 is true \(note that the labels with the association \223assigned\224 are used here\herefore, the statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_info\224 can be executed. Moreover, the statements \223w_hour := work_hour;\224 and \223h_pay hour_pay;\224 within \223get_info\224 can be executed after a similar comparison Requirement 2 If a manager browses the information of a worker assigned to him, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker assigned to a manage, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 002 ML md1  if EFF_ASSO is empty then md1 is not allowed to invoke under the associations the information flow is not secure, exit algorithm end if  EFF_VAR_ASSO  EFF_ASSO  002   


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
