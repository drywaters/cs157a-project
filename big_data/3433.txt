Fluctuations of the Chinese Real Estate Market: Price Stickiness and Non equilibrium Li Zhi Department of Economics Nanjing University Nanjing, China Email: 563616148@qq.com Li Weijun Department of Economics Nanjing University Nanjing, China Email: liweijunfinance@sina.com Wang Yu Department of Economics Anhui University of Technology Maanshan, China Email: aderek.wang@gmail.com Abstract Price stickiness is a problem faced by macro controlling and policy making, also is the core idea of the neoKeynesians and emerging neo-cla 
ssical scholars. The research on the sticky price of Chin ese real estate market has positive policy implications. We use 22 big and medium cities monthly housing price data in China from Jan.2006 to Nov.2012. We research from multiple per spectives of price fluctuation frequency, amplitude s, tendencies and pricing pattern. We find that the eastern cities get a lower price adjustment frequency and show strong pr ice rigidity, but at the same time 1-month and 12-month results show that the amplitudes of eastern cities are lager than th at of central and western cities We decompose the housing pri ce into state-dependent and time-dependent parts and find a significant non- equilibrium characteristic of price fluctuatio ns. First, when the price goes 
up, it behaves more like a monopoly seller market and tends to be price-determined pricing pattern, however, It show competitive market pricing pattern when in the contraction market condition; Second, the state-dependent coefficients of eastern cities are larger indica ting that the east ern cities get higher market-oriented degree of real estate market, the price fluctuations are determined more by market factors Keywords-real estate; price stickness; pricing pattern asymmetry I I NTRODUCTION With the development of global urbanization and financial shocks, real estate ma rket plays an important role 
in the macro economic society. Fi rst, the real estate market stimulate the development of real economy through the huge investment quantities, on the other side, its capital-intensive features will make the supply and demand sides associated with the virtual finan cial markets in terms of the capital constraints and inter-temporal configuration of issues. The recent three years statistic data of statistical bulletin from the National Bureau showed that, the real estate industry direct investment come up to 5.756, 7.569 and 9.236 trillion Yuan in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, are 14.462 16.049% and 17.784% in the percentage of GDP. Consider other indirect factors, it can be said that contemporary Chinese economic growth, empl 
oyment, financial security the gap between the rich and the poor, many other social and livelihood issues are closely tied up with the real estate market. The housing price fluct uations are undoubtedly the core issues concerning the overall situation, since the price fluctuations will not only affect th e residents pay ability and investment decisions, but also can transmitted to the general level of consumption and domestic demands through the wealth effect channel. Further, it also can reflect the market bubbles and the derivative financial security, the gap between the rich and the po or as well as other sensitive topics. Therefore, the analysis of the housing price fluctuations can significantly reveal the complexity and nonlinearity for the long term macroeconomic stability  However, a controversial problem is that the political 
controlling efforts have been enhanced in recent years weather the monthly rising housing price data of 70 large and medium cities from the Statistical Bulletin 1 or the market overreaction or even vari ous distortions transaction behavior under the “Five Rules”, it seems that the frequent regulation do not really catch the real estate market price fluctuations, conversely, but ha ve raised market expectations of confusion and even panic and eventually lead to policy and market dubious. It is worth pondering in the time of rapid economic growth, accelerated urbanization and unprecedented release of the housing needs, what is the micro mechanism of real estate market fluctuations? Do it show the degree of price stic kiness or other characteristics 
This is undoubtedly related to the micro-foundation of policy making, also is the fundamental issue that the precision of the regulation and the expected flexibility in managing that need to be clarified II LITERATURE REVIEW The sticky price theory can di vide into two major fields the first is focused on th e maximize profits of manufactures and the games between supply and demand pricing methods such as menu costs\(Hicks, 1935; Barro,1972\ir pricing\(Rotemberg,2005 and mantissa pricing\(Kashyap 1995\ess effects on price fluctuations. S tigler\(1942,1946\onsider  1 Under the background of the “New Five Rules” in Mar, 2013, the 
Mar, 2013 70 cities housing price on statistical bulletin of the National Statistic Bureau shows that, the num of the cities that price rise is 68, unchanged is 1, the largest rising amplitude is 3.2%; comparing with the same time last year, the num of the cities that price fall is 67, unchanged is 1, the largest amplitude is 11.2 2013 6th International Conference on Information Mana g ement, Innovation Mana g ement and Industrial En g ineerin g 978-1-4799-0245-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 19 


that consumers price searching activity under the incomplete information is constrained by the information cost and ultimately cause the tr ansaction price stickiness Taylor\(1980\believes that manufactures usually follow a fixed production plan to adju st the price, Calvo\(1983 considers that manufactures follows a fixed promotion of each phase to adjust the price randomly. There are also scholars from the perspective of viscosity model\(Mankiw and Reis,2002;2006 learning model\(Evans and Honkapohja,2001\terogeneity of expectations\(Branch and McGough,200 4\o explain price stickiness. Kitamura\(2008 notek\(2010\bines the sticky information theory and menu costs theory and improve the explanatory power of the macro price data Dupor\(2010 ed the Phillip curve model incorporating sticky price and information model thus explained the U.S.A inflation at some extant. Mankiw and Reis\(2010 not considering the cost of information, the individual information processing capacity is limited and un even, also makes it po ssible to slow the dissemination of information, and ultimately lead to lags of price changes Recently, a new trend is that some scholars use standard statistical methods and price decomposition model to extract the price stickiness information and research the market structure meaning from the perspectives of time-dependent pricing \(TDP ndent pricing Klenow and Kryvtsov,2008 Drainage Shen Ning, 2012\hich provides the background for the implementation of political regulations. One of the main conclusions is that if the price decomposition results are primarily related to time, implying a lower market-oriented level and less competition, such as the developing countries in the common law of price fluctuations \(Gagnon,20 09\Conversely, if the relationship between price adjustment and market conditions is significant., implying a higher market level, the impact of price adjustment strategy is more effective, such as Europe the United States and other count ries\(Klenow and Kryvtsov 2008; Lein, 2010 The housing price has arou sed widespread concerns since it plays an important role in macroeconomic market the research can be divided into two categories. The first research field mainly focus on a variety of exogenous variables, such as the effects of price fluctuations on policy evaluation. Other researches focus on the relationship between housing characteristics and prices, such as location floor, orientation transportation and ot her neighborhood characteristics impacts on housing prices, for the Hednoic Model, which aims to prov ide a reference point for housing transactions and taxes. In summary, the existing researches provide a useful reference for people to research house price and its fluctuations, but from a more practical point of view why the housing price performance under the intensive policy regulations is still uncertain? Do it imply the sticky price effects as well as the role of investment properties of asymmetric adjustment mechanism? In fact, these are the details that we need to aware when considering the regulation timing, region al differences, and effects evaluation of the micro regul ation implementation Unfortunately, the existing studies seem to be lack of consideration of these issues, also is the focus of market expectations management that need to be clarify. We note that today’s government regulations and policies concern much about price stickiness and its nonlinear characteristics and try to eliminate price stickiness\( Branch et , 2009 ; Reis 2009 \rive to control Scientifically” \( Mishkin 2007 ncement of policy transparency credibility and forward looking capability The dual properties of consumption and investment of real estate, as well as the market structure, location operating status, behavior fi nance and even financial income and other factors, all these factors can influence the complexity of the price fluctuations. Based on the model of Klenow and Kryvtsov\(2008 we decompose the housing price fluctuations into time, space and states conditions which not only contribute to the observed dynamic changes from short-term to long-ter m, but also reveals the nonequilibrium characteristic of ho using price fluctuations on the dimensions of state and space respectively. In this paper we use the housing price data of 22 representative cities in China, the monthly data are from Jan 2006 to Nov 2012, and discuss the price stickiness a nd non-equilibrium from the perspective of frequency, amplitude orientation, and pricing patterns, also provide a new perspective for the refinement of political regulations and controlling decisions III DATA AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT Considering the long time span of housing price data the price stickiness can be derivative through the frequency amplitude and tendency of the price adjustment, and thus label the “Taps” of different cities, further, the pricing model and decomposition methods can help us find the inherent laws and implied market structure from its adjustment mechanism A Calculation of Price Stickiness Index 1. Amplitude The amplitude of pricing changes may be spatial different considering the city location, public infrastructure economic development and ot her source endowment conditions, the responses of inform ation shocks for different cities are not synchronized, so we analyze the 1-month amplitude and 10-month amplitude respectively in the model       1,12 nn it m it i t m i t m im tt RRnpppnm         012\012 Where we only consider when  0 im R  to exclude the unchanging data n is the num of observations in different time scales 2. Tendency The financial commodity prices rise and fall show significant asymmetry based on the existing research, such as the “two eight phenom enon”, which can be further explained by the “frame effect of behavior finance theory We focus on the differences of house prices fluctuations 20 


under rise and fall two stat es, which undoubtedly has a strong practical significance, which also compensate for the related research blanks in the related fields Define the price rising indicator  it m I  and falling indicator  it m I  When  it i t m p p  015   1 it m I   or else  0 it m I   when  it i t m p p     1 it m I   or else  0 it m I    thus we can obtain the price rising tendency and the corresponding falling tendency is    nn i m it m it m it m tt gI II    012\012    nn i m it m it m it m tt gI II   012\012 B Pricing Pattern and Price Decomposition In this section, we decom pose the housing price fluctuations into time-depen dent parts and state-dependent parts to reveal the market structure and the policy orientation through pricing pattern model We research 1-month and 12month pricing pattern respectively based on the work of Gargon \(2009\ and Klenow&Kryst ov\(2008\ and divide the price changes periods into up and down two regimes, which can provide a more complete results to reveal its dynamic and asymmetrical features First, we assume that the price fluctuations weights of different cities are same, we can divide the price rates into fraction of the cities that the price changes and price change amplitude\(Liang shenning, 2012       t tm it it m it it m it m ii tm p pp p p p p        012\012 Where  it m I is the price-change indicator when  it i t m pp     1 it m I  or else  0 it m I  then \(6 be written as          tm tm it i t m i t m i tm itm i it m i fr dp pp p I I     012 012 012        tm f r is the fraction of the cities that the house prices are changed  tm dp is the monthly price changing rates. So if  tm  is more related to  tm f r means when the fraction of the cities that the price change increase, the effects on housing price rates are significant, this is more likely to be statedependent. Conversely, when  tm  is related to  tm dp  which means the relationship between price fluctuation and price change amplitude is more significant, and is not so much related to the market conditions thus tends to be timedependent Further, considering the market conditions, we divide the monthly price rates into the sum of rising and falling two sectors                 tm tm tm tm it m it i t m i t m it m it i t m i t m ii tm itm itm ii it m it m ii fr fr dp dp Ippp Ippp II II           012\012 012\012 012\012                         Where  tm f r  is the fraction of the cities that the price goes up, and  tm dp  is the corresponding housing price rates  tm f r  and  tm dp  are the corresponding values when in a contraction market condition C Data Source The house price data in this paper come from SouFang Web and 365 real estate web, the observation window is from Jan 2006 to Nov 2012, total of 83 monthly data.2 As the start points of different cities housing price are not consistent, we choose 22 cities as our research objectives Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu , Dalian , Xiamen , Xi'an Changsha , Fuzhou , Shenyang , Zhengzhou , Beijing Shanghai , Tianjin , Shenzhen , Guangzhou , Hangzhou Wuxi, Suzhou, Hefei , Haikou , Nanchang and Qingdao. We can see that the chosen 22 cities almost come from the National Bureau of Statistics Data Base and thus be relatively objective and representative IV ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS In this section, we give the empirical results of the proposed models and algorithm. The frequency, amplitude and tendency of housing price fluctuations are presented in the first part and then the pricing pattern results are given in the second part A Amplitude of Price Fluctuations We measure the magnitude of price changes through the up and down two conditional states, Fig.1 and Fig.2 show 1month and 12-month price changes amplitude respectively to observe the dynamic and spatial housing price evolution paths Fig.1 shows the spatial differences of price change amplitude in short-time scale, roughly, based on the onemonth decrease amplitude value 0.06, the entire sample can be divided into high and low two sectors. The price change amplitude of eastern cities are higher than central and western cities. Specifically, Xiamen, Hangzhou, Beijing Shenzhen, Fuzhou, Qingdao, Nanjing, Dalian, Shanghai and Haikou ten cities are located in the high volatility group with typical eastern coastal feature, but also reflects higher price changes amplitude. I  2 We compare the two sources of data and get a consistent price changing trend. We rebuild the missing data through the spectrum smoothing method, the results are consistent with the relatively smooth market of Chinese real estate market trends before the 2008 financial crisis 21

Compared with Fig.1, the spatial differences is strengthened and more significant. Although the concentration degree decline Suzhou, Wuxi and Guangzhou and other cities have joined in the high amplitude group from short-term to long-term price changes in Fig.2. We also find that Beijing, Hangzhou and Xiamen still locate in a special position, the 12-month price changes amplitudes are relatively larger, but the 12month falling amplitude of Xiamen is also more significant  beijing changsha chengdu dalian fuzhou guangzhou haikou hangzhou hefei nanchang nanjing qingdao shanghai shanzhen shanyang suzhou tianjing wuxi wuhan xian xiamen zhengzhou 15 2 25 3 35 12m-rise 0 05 1 15 2 12m-drop Figure 2 twelve-month\(short-term price change amplitude\(the horizon axis represent 12-month falling am plitude, the vertical axis denote 12month rising amplitude which means the housing price is lack of supports compared with Beijing and Hangzhou.Fig.2 show the asymmetrical features of price changes amplitudes in the long-term time scale, the 12-month rising amplitudes are larger than falling amplitudes for most of the 22 cities, which is the main difference with short-time price fluctuations, implying Chinese real estate market is in a rising circle, this is determined by the asymmetrical features of housing price fluctuations B Tendency of Price Fluctuations We figure out the price ch anging tendency through calculating the increasing and decreasing times of the house price changes within the entire sample window 3 We find asymmetrical characteristics of price change tendency from the total 83 months house price data from Mar 2006 to Dec 2012, the increasing tendency is over 50% and tends to be more significant in the long-term time scale, the value of 12 months rising tendency is larger than decreasing tendency which also explains Chinese real estate market cycle from the point view of price changing probability. A relatively obvious rule is that most cities in Fig.3 are linear gathered in a strip area with positive slope, especially for the eastern countries. The frequency and amplitude of Changsha Shenyang and Hefei although show quite difference in Fig.1 and Fig.2, the three cities present a similar spatial distribution features in this section. This is undoubted show that the price stickiness level of eastern cities is more significant in terms of price change tendency nanjing wuhan chengdu dalian xiamen xian changsha fuzhou shenyang zhengzhou beijing shanghai tianjing shenzhen guangzhou hangzhou wuxi suzhou hefei haikou nanchang qingdao 5 6 7 8 6m-riseprob 6 7 8 9 1 12m-riseprob Figure 3 six month and twelve-month price rising tendency\(the horizon axis represent 12-month rising tendency, the vertical axis denote 6-month rising tendency C Non-equilibrium of Price Fluctuations We observe the housing price stickiness of Chinese real estate market through the previous work and we try to explain the internal logic behind non-equilibrium price  3 Considering the randomness of the price adjustment within the span of one-month time scale, we also report more stable housing price tendency of 6-month and 12-month time scale. Further, since the total probability of rising and falling is 1, so the price rising probability is the reverse value of falling 22

The correlation coefficients with IM are 0.760, 0.757, 0.932 and 0.981, the correlation coefficients with EM are 0.374, 0.7 34, 0.816 and 0.880 under the time scale of 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12month when the price goes up. When the housing price falls contraction\the corresponding value of IM are 0.825 0.638, 0.407, 0.322, an d the correlation coefficients with EM are 0.772, 0,877, 0.898 and 0.893 respectively. The economic implications behind this set of figures is that the non-equilibrium of price fluctuations is determined by the inherent microstructure characteristics of Chinese real estate market, this feature is clearly changed in up and down two market conditions. When  is related to IM which means monopoly power and seller market become the dominant factor of pricing mechanism in the process that price goes high. Conversely  is related more to EM, reflecting the brokenness of the existing market structure balance, the seller dominant force is significantly weakened, the price stickiness level also falls down and the housing price are susceptible to the influence of market atmosphere, the environment and policy shocks. Ho wever, for the investment property of Chinese real estate market, it shows great importance that the price stickiness drops and competitive pricing adjusts in a rational span when the housing price falls down, which can increase consumer surplus and promote social welfare; However, if the market environment sticks into irrational conditions, it can easily lead to the expectation panic dominated by the state-dependent feature of Chinese real estate market. In other words, the asset price may easily divorce from the internal balanced criteria and concern more about what is happening around, the Japanese real estate bubble burst in 1991, the Southeast Asian financial crisis in 1997, the 2007 U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, as well as the 1990s Hainan proper ty bubble burst, all reveals the overreaction, irrational selling “finite rationality Gao Bo, 2008 the results in Table 2, the further research on nonequilibrium and the implied pricing mechanism characteristics of price fluctuations, which is very important of inhibition the market infection risks 2. Non-equilibrium of spatial conditions Location is an important factor in the real estate pricing mechanism, also contribute to the primary non-equilibrium of real estate market and can be reflected by the nonequilibrium characteristics of price fluctuations in the former section of the paper. Follow this logic, we divide the cities sample into eastern and mid-western two sectors to analyze the hosing price decomposition results TABLE III H OUSING PRICE DECOMPOSITIONS UNDER SPATIAL CONDITIONS  EASTERN CITIES   Eastern cities Time Scale Variable Correlation coefficient with PI Coefficient of PI P-value 1-month EM 0.434 0.149 0.000 IM 0.979 0.953 0.000 3-month EM 0.321 0.153 0.004 IM 0.979 0.967 0.000 6-momth EM 0.356 0.253 0.002 IM 0.984 0.987 0.000 12-momth EM 0.559 0.705 0.000 IM 0.994 1.033 0.000 TABLE IV H OUSING PRICE DECOMPOSITIONS UNDER SPATIAL CONDITIONS  WESTERN CITIES   Mid-western cities Time Scale Variable Correlation coefficient with PI Coefficient of PI P-value 1-month EM 0.224 0.054 0.043 IM 0.984 0.947 0.000 3-month EM 0.258 0.065 0.021 IM 0.971 0.954 0.000 6-momth EM 0.237 0.110 0.038 IM 0.979 0.942 0.000 23

On one side, the IM coefficients of eastern cities are larger than that of mid and western cities. The IM coefficients of eastern cities are 0.979, 0.979, 0.984 and 0 994 at 1% significant level. The corresponding values of mid and eastern cities are 0.984 0.971, 0.979 and 0.993 also significant at 5% level, which means the eastern cities get higher price stickiness level since the IM coefficients are larger indicating the lower relationship with the market conditions. On the other side the EM coefficients of eastern cities are also larger than that of mid and western cities. The EM coefficients of eastern cities are 0.434, 0.321, 0.356 and 0559 at 1% significant level. The corresponding values of mid and eastern cities are 0.224, 0.258, 0.237 and 0.460, also significant at 5 level, reflects higher degree of market factors contributing to the pricing mechanism, therefore, the lower frequency larger amplitude and higher tendency of the eastern price changes are determined by the internal market structure and pricing mechanism, also is the result of market selections V C ONCLUSIONS AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS After the text edit has been completed, the paper is ready for the template.

The following are the conclusions 1 Price stickiness of market fluctuations First the sticky price performs as larger increasing rates and higher probability of rising tendency, which determines the stickiness of the Chinese real estate market in a relatively stable upward cycle. Second, the decompositions results show more time-dependence, reflecting the existence of non-competitive or seller dominant in Chinese real estate market, and is the micro foundation of price stickiness to generate and sustain. The future political regulations should pay full attention to the price stickiness of Chinese real estate market 2. Non-equilibrium of market fluctuations. The real estate market has strong regional and heterogeneity features The results of this paper show the significant nonequilibrium of housing price fluctuations. First is the nonequilibrium of price changes under different market conditions, the larger IM value in the up cycle shows higher price stickiness level. The EM value is more significant in the down cycle implying the strong effects on the market mechanism and may exist expectation infection in the real estate market. Therefore, the price stickiness is undoubtedly the main reason of the increased difficulty of policy control in the rising cycle, also is the premise of the trading tax passed on to the buy sides, which is more prominent in the eastern cities  R EFERENCES  Anil K Kashyap 1995.

Poselet Detector Felzenszwalb et al  Detector CAVIAR 60.26 56.86 BBT 65.99 42.78 Table 4 Tracking accuracy MOTA of the proposed approach using the poselet person detector compared to using the person detector from  5  ple tracks following the same person Person Detector In order to validate our choice of person detector we modi\002ed the proposed tracking approach to support another state-of-the-art object detector by Felzenszwalb et al   5  Results are sho wn in T able 4  Due to the much smaller number of parts in this detector we used the full set of part detectors in the observation model of the modi\002ed approach Particles are scored based on their distance to the closest precomputed person detection and its detection score Occlusion reasoning and appearance model as well as all other aspects of the approach remain the same Similar to the poselet detector the detector from  5  has problems detecting the small persons far in the background of the CAVIAR dataset However persons which are partially occluded or cut off by the lower border of the image are less frequently detected by  5  than by the poselet detector This leads to tracks terminating earlier or more frequently i.e  a higher rate of track misses and correspondingly a slightly lower MOTA On the Big Bang Theory dataset the difference in tracking accuracy is much more signi\002cant The detector form  5  pro vides fe wer or only weak detections in the many cases where only the upper third of a person is visible or persons are in non-pedestrian poses These weak detections often do not suf\002ce to initialize or sustain a track Lowering the corresponding thresholds leads to a large number of false positive tracks on background objects such as plants or lamps and tracks surviving for a long time without presence of a person 6 Conclusion We present a tracking-by-detection approach that combines a particle 002lter with a part-based person detector We use both detection and appearance cues for scoring each track and conduct explicit occlusion reasoning The large number of available part detectors is handled ef\002ciently by a dynamic selection approach which manages a subset of detectors for each track and for track initialization This approach achieves a signi\002cant speed-up while retaining good tracking accuracy We demonstrate consistently high accuracy on two challenging datasets from different domains Our approach does not rely on any scene knowledge and deals well with moving cameras and non-pedestrian body poses Acknowledgments This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF as part of the MisPel program under grant no 13N12063 and as part of the Quaero Program funded by OSEO French State agency for innovation The views expressed herein are the authors responsibility and do not necessarily re\003ect those of OSEO or BMBF References  M Andriluka S Roth and B Schiele Peopletracking-bydetection and people-detection-by-tracking In CVPR  2008  K Bernardin and R Stiefelhagen Ev aluating multiple object tracking performance the clear mot metrics EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  2008  L Bourde v and J Malik Poselets Body part de tectors trained using 3d human pose annotations In ICCV  2009  M D Breitenstein F  Reichlin B Leibe E K oll er Meier  and L Van Gool Robust tracking-by-detection using a detector con\002dence particle 002lter In ICCV  2009  P  Felzenszw alb D McAllester  and D Ramanan A discriminatively trained multiscale deformable part model In CVPR  2008  C Huang B W u and R Ne v atia Rob ust object tracking by hierarchical association of detection responses In ECCV  2008  M Isard and A Blak e Condensation 226 conditional density propagation for visual tracking IJCV  1998  K J 250 ungling and M Arens Detection and tracking of objects with direct integration of perception and expectation In Int Workshop on Visual Surveillance VS  2009  M Roth M B 250 auml R Nevatia and R Stiefelhagen Robust multi-pose face tracking by multi-stage tracklet association In ICPR  2012  B Y ang C Huang and R Ne v atia Learning af 002nities and dependencies for multi-target tracking using a CRF model In CVPR  2011  B Y ang and R Ne v atia Online Learned Discrimina ti v e P artBased Appearance Models for Multi-Human Tracking In CVPR  2012 49

     Fig 12 Results comparison Planned routes top left Passenger ow comparison of two segments at different frequency top right Opened nightbus routes bottom left Number of delivered passengers at different frequency  R 1 vs R 2  bottom right is motivated by the needs of applying pervasive sensing communication and computing technology for sustainable city development To solve the problem we propose a two-phase approach for night-bus route planning In the rst phase we devise method to identify locations of the candidate bus stops with the passenger pick-ups and drop-offs as inputs In the second phase with the bus route origin destination and candidate bus stops as inputs we develop two heuristic algorithms to automatically generate candidate bus routes and nally we select the best route which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions On a real-world dataset which contains more than 1.57 million passenger delivery trips we compare our proposed candidate bus stop identi“cation method with the popular k means clustering method and show that our method can generate more reasonable and meaningful results We further extensively evaluate our proposed probability based spreading algorithm for automatic bus route generation and validate its effectiveness as well as its superior performance over the heuristic topk spreading algorithm Further more we show the selected night-bus route with our proposed approach is better than a newly started night-bus route-in-service in Hangzhou China This work is among our initial attempts to apply pervasive computing techniques in achieving better urban planning of smart cities With the constraints of the approach and the acquired data this work still has several limitations 1 Human mobility patterns uncovered by taxi GPS traces are biased and incomplete thus the designed bus route might not be the best considering the fact that taxi traf“c does not re”ect the whole passenger ow and people taking taxis might not be willing to switch to public transport for various reasons 2 The work makes some assumptions in problem formulation and evaluation for example for bus stop determination we set the walkable distance as 500 meters and the threshold for cluster split and merge is 150 meters apparently the choice of those parameters would affect the results but a study of the parameter sensitivity is not provided due to the space limitation 3 Currently we only explore the issue of designing the best bus route for a given OD pair the proposed approach is still unable to tackle the design of a bus route network In the future we plan to broaden and deepen this work in several directions First we attempt to investigate the optimal bus route design with more real-life assumptions such as varied bus operation frequency and limited bus capacity Second we plan to study the impact of parameter change on the bus route design and the added bus route on the taxi services along the bus route Third we would like to develop practical systems leveraging on taxi GPS traces enabling a series of pervasive smart transportation services A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the shepherd Dr

15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
