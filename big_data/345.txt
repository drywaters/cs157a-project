Context awareness in I-centric systems Dynamic Context Learning Using a Rule-Based Approach Olaf Drogehorn Sandra Haseloff Tino Loeffler Waltenegus Dargie SianLun Lau Klaus David University of Kassel Wilhelmshoeher Allee 73 34121 Kassel Germany droegehorn haseloff loeffler dargie lau david}@uni-kassel.de Abstract Capturing contextual information especially higherlevel contexts enables systems to understand and predict the behaviour of a mobile user This kind of information is mostly implicit abstracting a complex state of a situation and can only partly be 
captured by sensors Higher-level context has the potential to make user applications simpler and more intuitive However composing higher-level contexts from explicit atomic contexts requires complex procedures to be used and uncertaintv due to inconsistent sensor readings and incomplete information to be reduced In this paper we introduce a new approach that assists application developers to take higher-level contexts into account without the need to know the details of atomic contexts To demonstrate our approach we will introduce the Context-Aware E-Pad CAEP we

from each other Services rarely depend on other services Each service is able to provide its own personalisation architecture interoperability is rarely required or wanted In pervasive computing services interact with each other to perform tasks on behalf of the user This interaction requires seamless personalisation architecture to allow for interoperability and to provide a personalised pervasive computing environment to the user Personalisation covers three main aspects 
0 gathering the context of the user  using configured and learned behaviour and capabilities of 
the user device network and service environment stored in profiles  adapting the service presentation and behaviour towards the available capabilities and context of the user and input/output devices The context of the user enables services to understand the user's intention Context awareness is meant to capture the situation the user is in Adaptation meets the capabilities of the user and his devices by converting content and service to the format and behaviour preferred by the user Profiles provide configured and learned 
behaviour preferences and capabilities of users devices networks and services to a personalisation system Nowadays it is an everyday practice to carry along mobile computers and communicate with them on the spur of the moment The implication is twofold On the one hand it has become commonplace for a user to own multiple devices on the other hand these devices as well as the users are no longer stationary As a consequence resources have become pervasive and a mobile user can access and process 
information virtually anywhere at any time Therefore mobile applications and services must evolve to make the needed computing tasks less obtrusive In other words the amount of explicit input a user has to supply to a computing task needs to be reduced In the field of mobile applications the addition of context awareness can meet this desire to reduce explicit input and user attention By enriching applications with implicit context infornation we can increase their awareness of people places and computing devices 
This awareness further leads to the execution of useful services with little or no involvement from the user Based on the aspects of personalisation and I-centric communication 7 we can list four important aspects of context-aware computing Implicit understanding of user's situation Context-aware applications assisted by numerous sensors and other context data sources can gain an understanding of a user's situation This greatly reduces the inherent input deficiency traditional mobile applications suffer 1 from 0-7803-9399-6/05/$20.00 251 2005 IEEE ISSNIP 2005 211 


Reduction of user side input and attention Success in capturing the context of a user allows for the invocation of services suited to the user's context and his preferences based on his profile and needs Adaptation In general in pervasive computing environments due to the mobility of both users and devices in space the states of available resources may change frequently With respect to this context-aware applications attempt to adapt their behaviour to the ever-changing context of a user the devices he uses the co-located people and the physical environment Provision of useful services Based on profiles and preferences context-aware applications are sensitive to change in preference of the mobile user and know which type of services to provide and which not to provide 2 for a given situation and context In this paper we will discuss some important issues context-aware application developers face and show how we have addressed a few of them The rest of this paper is organised as follows in section 2 we will discuss some of the challenges in designing context-aware applications including related works in section 3 we will introduce rules and related rule based approaches in section 4 we will introduce the Context-Aware E-Pad CAEP and present its typical features and finally in section 5 we will give a brief conclusion 2 Challenges in Designing Context-Aware Applications Human-human interaction besides the expressiveness and the richness of the language used involves implicit understanding of the context that encompasses the subject of interaction On the other hand computers are relatively good to monitor capture and report their internal states as well as the internal states of other computers They are however greatly limited to capture the context of their users as well as the physical environment in which they operate Employing sensors may augment their sensing capacity and may enhance their awareness of the external world Nevertheless awareness is more than just sensing Awareness means making sense of the gathered data Our brain presents the world to us not as a collection of raw data but wholly conceptually and meaningfully 3 Likewise computers must translate the huge amount of raw data that are collected from sensors and other context data sources so that is meaningful to a human user Unfortunately the richness and complexity of the world in which a mobile user and his devices operate make this process a difficult task 4 Besides since context information can be gathered in many different ways undoubtedly semantic conflicts may occur due to heterogeneity of context data sources There are two types of semantic conflicts representational and ontological Representational conflicts occur when two context data sources use different terms to refer to the same context ontological conflicts occur when two context data sources use the same term to refer to two different contexts Therefore resolving such semantic conflicts in order to enable interoperability is a significant challenge Furthermore we cannot capture all types of contexts using sensors There are higher-level contexts which abstract complex states of a situation They are implicit by nature and focus on the essential aspects of an entity and ignore or conceal less-important or non-essential aspects Higher-level contexts are composed of numerous atomic contexts and involve reasoning procedures to reduce uncertainty due to inconsistent sensor readings and missing information Apart from the reasoning task identifying relevant atomic context that has the ability to describe some potential properties of the higher-level contexts has to be addressed by the application developer In the next section we will discuss related work before we introduce our contribution 2.1 Related Work Cohen et al 5 defined and implemented a nonprocedural programming language called iQL for higher-level context composition The language assists application developers to identify and bind heterogeneous data sources An iQL programmer expresses requirements onto data sources instead of identifying specific sources a runtime system discovers appropriate data sources binds to them and rebinds when properties of data sources change Korpipaa et al 6 propose a context recognition service that is capable of composing higher-level contexts It uses a naive Bayesian classifier which reasons about a higher-level context by aggregating numerous simple context atoms The context atoms are selected based on their ability to describe some potential properties of the higher-level context Other criteria include the feasibility of measuring or recognising the context chosen as accurately and unambiguously as possible Among its most important tasks the framework manages uncertainty of sensor readings through the use of probability-based inference and fuzzy membership Using the framework a mobile device recognises whether it is outdoors or indoors whether a sound is from a car a water tap rock music classical music an elevator a speech or from some other source For the first two higher-level contexts namely indoors and outdoors 14 atomic contexts describing the environment's light humidity and temperature were  We use atomic contexts and lower-level contexts synonym in both cases we mean context types that can directly be captured by employing sensors 212 


used while 47 audio-based context atoms were used to describe the remaining seven higher-level contexts The above approaches identify and describe at design time the type of atomic contexts required for composition In iQL they are described as requirements aggregators receive from the application a description of the type of context sources it binds the naive Bayesian classifier of context recognition service requires an ontological description of the atomic contexts together with a vector of context atom confidence values Identifying atomic contexts at design time limits a composition assignment to those context atoms We strive to make a composition process more flexible kilometers  In SQL a derivation rule could look like the following statement where a list of long rivers is derived CREATE VIEW LongRiver SELECT RiverID RiverName RiverLenght FROM River WHERE RiverLenght  1000 Derivation rules are also well-known from e.g Prolog or Datalog The following example shows a derivation rule in Prolog which derives that station A and station C are connected if station A and B and station B and C are connected connected\(a,c connected\(a,b connected\(b,c 3 Existing rules and rule based systems for context interpretation According to 10 rules can be classified into several categories There are integrity rules also called integrity constraints derivation rules also called deduction rules or horn clauses and reaction rules also called action rules or event condition action rules ECA These three categories of rules are often referred to when using the term business rules Additionally the term production rule is widely spread An integrity rule is a constraint that must be satisfied in all states and all state transitions of an entity Therefore integrity rules can be classified into state constraints which must be satisfied in all states and process or behaviour constraints which must be satisfied in all state transitions State constraints must hold at any point of time An example of a state constraint applied by a car rental company is The driver must be at least 24 years old Process constraints on the other hand refer to the dynamic integrity of a system they restrict the admissible transitions from one state of the system to another Integrity constraints are well-known in e.g SQL The following example shows the creation of a table in the Data Definition Language DDL defining table RentalOrder the attributes OrderNo and Driver and an integrity constraint which restricts all drivers to be at least 24 years old starting with the key word CHECK CREATE TABLE RentalOrder OrderNo INTEGER PRIMARY KEY Driver CHAR\(10 REFERENCES Person CHECK 23  SELECT Age FROM Person WHERE PersID  Driver Derivation rules are statements of knowledge which are derived from other knowledge by inference or mathematical computation The derived knowledge does not have to be stored because it can always be derived from existing knowledge or again from derived information on demand Derivation rules are of an ifcondition-then-conclusion format An example of a derivation rule is the following A long river is a river which has a length of more than one thousand Reaction rules express rules which are concerned with the invocation of actions in response to events and consist of the conditions under which actions must be taken Therefore reaction rules define the behaviour of systems in response to events received from their environment and to received communication events Reaction rules are of an if-event/condition-thenaction/effect format The following example presents a reaction rule in SQL The trigger countryUpdate always comes into operation after an update of column code in table Country occurred The trigger then updates the column country in the Citv table CREATE TRIGGER countryUpdate AFTER UPDATE OF code ON Country FOR EACH ROW BEGIN UPDATE City SET country=:NEW.code WHERE country=:OLD.code END Production rules are well-known for their use in rule systems like CLIPS and Jess..They are of an ifcondition-then-action format and could be considered as a special case of the general concept of reaction rules with their if-event/condition-then-action/effect format The term business rules which is an umbrella term for the introduced categories of rules refers to all the policies procedures and definitions of how a company interacts with its customers and partners These rules are used in all kind of documents like documents about contracts customer relationships charters marketing strategies in databases application systems and pieces of program code in general Using the term business rule at the level of a business domain rules are expressed in a natural language statement which can sometimes be transformed into executable rule expressions by means of declarative rule representation languages 4 Context-Aware E-Pad CAEP CAEP is a word processor and exhibits similar characteristics to those of other word processors a new 213

dBfJ[context:light_Intensity 720 Luxitcontex Figure 1 A snapshot of CAEP Unlike many word processors however CAEP is context-aware in that it reacts to the context of a user to undertake a word processing task less obtrusively The essential features of CAEP are summarised as follows  Whenever a user interacts with it CAEP associates the interaction in the form of user actions with the situation in which the interaction takes place This situation is characterised by a set of atomic contexts which can directly be determined  From the association it generates a user profile or a subpart thereof to reason about higher-level contexts in terms of correlated decisions  From repeated observation and an aggregate of associations it learns the behaviour of its user in order to provide useful services in a proactive manner  Moreover the user's profile is useful for a semantic-based interaction between a user and the application For instance for people who have to deal with many files per day remembering a file's name is a nightmare Using CAEP accessing a file is fairly simple all the user has to remember is a situation context that is related to a file Intemally CAEP maps the context to a file name and helps the user narrow his searching space 4.1 Reasoning about higher-level contexts in terms of users decisions One common feature shared by all context-aware applications is that they react to the context of the user Here we use context loosely It may consist of the state of devices networks places as well as co-located people In most context-aware applications this reaction to contexts entails one or more event-condition-action ECA rules We present a model of the introspected world by a set of well-formulated formulas in first-order logic Hence a typical ECA rule may look like Vi 3j 3k 31 3m temperatule\(i A i j  heater\(k I k 1 1 Rule 1 defines two predicates temperature and heater to state a general rule that if the value of a temperature measurement descends below a certain threshold a heater should be switched on Now let us consider another formula as given by rule 2 3y 3x lecture y D pad x A loaded x 2 In rule 2 we want to load a pad for the user whenever he attends lecture y In this case the predicate lecture is a higher-level context which is an abstraction of a complex situation Since by employing sensor information this high-level context cannot directly be concluded our approach to solve this is using a mechanism to reason about this context using a set of atomic contexts A simple inference rule may comprise a formula such as room r A temperature r h Vr Vh Vi 3j 3k 31 3m 3n relative_ humidity\(r,i 3 z lecture\(n J Defining our world model using the formulas and rule 3 at design time has two drawbacks First the application is bound to react only to the context types temperature and humidity thereby missing the chance to describe lecture in terms of other contexts We do not mean of course that these two atomic contexts alone can describe the context in a lecture room We rather mean that a lecture session may as well be described by other context types Besides here the availability of context data sources or sensors that provide these context types is already assumed Secondly all the existential quantifiers must be predetermined either by the application developer or by the user himself CAEP's design concept frees both the application developer and the user from describing a higher-level context in terms of lower-level contexts No specific rules are required at the side of the application at design time Instead the application observes users decisions2 for a given time to associate each decision with a set of contexts that are acquired at the time the decision is made Note that a decision is not associated with a predefined set of atomic contexts Decisions are the basic elements with which useful services can be executed Each decision corresponds to an action routine whose execution causes CAEP to take certain actions transforming one world model to some other world model The observation time can be either an absolute time interval or a relative one A relative observation time may be specified using any one of the decisions we mentioned earlier During an observation time CAEP associates a set of context atoms with every decision the mobile user makes Our goal is to express a decision in terms of the situation this set of context atoms characterises Hence 2 Decisions in this context are loading editing creating sending and receiving a pad External decision histories such as switching a mobile phone from a ring mode to a vibration mode are stored as the user's profile and are accessible to CAEP 214

over time Context data sources may come move or their performance may deteriorate due to aging of sensors depletion of battery power channel dynamics etc Consequently two associations may incorporate different sets of atomic contexts Once representative context atoms are identified and associated with a decision the result is saved as a loading profile or a subpart so that it can be accessed by other applications as well This rule-based profile is useful to associate additional correlated decisions to reason about more complex situations Such an association is shown in equation 5 Table 1 displays four associations for a loading decision during a one month observation time decision pad\(pad _ x loaded\(pad _ x followedBv phone phone _ y A ring _ status phone _ the set of context atoms should represent the situation as accurately as possible To minimise erroneous conclusions about a situation CAEP searches at runtime and binds to heterogeneous context sources like aggregators since heterogeneous aggregators gather and aggregate context data from sources which are spatially and temporally diversified Once the observation time is over context types which appear in the association repeatedly and which maintain predictable characteristics both with respect to their previous values as well as with respect to other context types are taken as representative contexts to express a decision in terms of a complex situation We will elaborate this by an example Suppose we want CAEP to reason about its whereabouts inside a university campus in the absence of a GPS receiver or an indoor localisation system Possible places are lecture rooms conference halls offices corridors a library a cafeteria a gym an amphitheatre an outdoor tennis court and so on CAEP should gather and processes environmental contexts such as temperature light intensity sound pressure humidity etc and based on empirical and heuristic context knowledge reason about particular places Moreover we want CAEP to learn the user's behaviour of loading a pad whenever he attends a particular lecture Since the user does not set a specific rule there is no need to know a priori which context types best describe the loading situation Therefore during the observation time CAEP listens to a loading decision When such a decision occurs it binds to available heterogeneous aggregators to gather context

computing task there are however contexts which cannot directly be captured by employing sensors or other context data sources These are higher-level abstractions of a complex situation and must be reasoned about in terms of numerous atomic contexts Existing context-aware applications incorporate rules that dictate a composition procedure and identify at design time the type of atomic contexts which potentially describe some properties of the higher-level context In this paper we introduced a way to exploit runtime contexts instead of defming atomic contexts at design time As a

consequently, the results approach more of the presented for the classic vector space model. The several possibilities of values of the parameters were tested however the collections behave in a similar way in its alteration The experiments showed that the proposed model improves the average precision of the answer set for all collections. Besides, the obtained medium precision was not harmed by the recall increase happened when expanding the queries 7. Conclusions In this paper, we presented an extension to the vector space model to contemplate the dependence among the terms of the collection. In the proposed model, the dependence among the terms is represented geometrically in the vector space The proposed model bases on the rotation of the term vectors, in agreement with the dependence among the terms. This rotation is made based on techniques that generate information on the correlation among terms of Proceedings of the International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium \(IDEAS  04 1098-8068/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the collection. In this work, we used the association rules, however, other techniques can be used The generation of association rules is a known technique of data mining, which allows finding frequent patterns in large databases. In the context of this paper it is used to find sets of terms that appear simultaneously in the collection of documents. This information is useful to modify the term vectors, so that they reflect the semantics of co-occurrence defined for the association rules The extension to the vector space model we presented contemplates the dependence among terms in a clear, flexible and new way. It is clear because the dependence incorporation among the terms is made step by step and the vector space basis reflects the semantics defined for the adopted technique. The proposed model is flexible because it allows the correlation incorporation among the terms of collection obtained in several ways Finally, the proposal is new because in the literature there is not an extension to the vector space model which modifies the vector space basis how it was done in this work We evaluated the effectiveness of the model proposed with four reference collections. There was an increase in the retrieval model effectiveness in comparison with the classic vector space model for all of the reference collections used As future works, the effectiveness of the proposed model will be compared to the effectiveness of the generalized vector space model. Besides, we will research other methods of obtaining correlation among the terms of a collection of documents. These methods will be incorporated in a geometric way to the model proposed in this paper.

The number of tuples created by this step is S  50  c  1   2  4   The rest of the steps create itemsets that should not participate in the count We create three different kind of tuples that break one

algorithm is independent to the ordering of the tuples Estimate the implication count using algorithm NIPS/CI with a fringe size of four and also without a bounded fringe Perform one hundred such experiments and calculate the mean and the standard deviation of both estimations The total number of tuples for each experiment can be derived by adding the partial number of tuples created in each

results for the case of a fringe with size F  4 while graphs Unbounded Fringe demonstrate the result for the case of an arbitrarily large fringe The error bars correspond to the statistical deviation of the mean error as that was computed by one hundred such experiments.The deviation is generally negligible which means that the error of the estimated S is always very close to the mean error We also observe that the difference between the estimation using a bounded fringe of size four and a unbounded one is negligible for a very wide range of implication counts and therefore a size of four

accurate estimates for distinct value queries and event reports This algorithm outperforms other estimators that are based on uniform sampling[8 9 e v e n when using much less sample space We also provide comparison with our Implication Lossy Counting ILC algorithm described in Section 5.1 which is based in the Lossy Counting algorithm introduced in For this series of experiments we used a real dataset of eight dimensions which was given to us by an OLAP company whose name we cannot disclose due to our agreement The cardinalities of the dimensions are presented in Table 3 The parameters of the algorithms are presented in Table 5 For NIPS/CI we used 64 concurrent bitmaps with a fringe size of four thus requiring memory enough to hold  2 4  1   64  K  1920 itemsets We expect that the averaging”\([5 o v e r these man y bitmaps will result in an error less than 10 We used the exact same sample space for DS The bound parameter t for DS was set to  1920  50  following the suggestion in F o r ILC we used an approximation parameter   0  01 which increases the memory requirements of ILC relative to those of NIPS/CI or DS On the average ILC used more than twice the memory that NIPS/CI and DS used For example for the experiment in Figure 7\(B it used more than 8,000 entries We evaluate the results of the algorithms with respect to the number of tuples the cardinality of the participating dimensions and the implication conditions To simulate a real data stream scenario we tracked the conditional implication counts of A  B  E  F and the unconditional B  E using the aforementioned algorithms The rst workload corresponds to quite large compound cardinality while the second to very moderate cardinalities Table 4 presents the actual aggregates for various instances of the stream for   5 and  1  60 We believe that most workloads fall somewhere in the middle with respect to the complexity of the wanted implications and the size of the returned counts Figure 7\(A depicts the relative error as the stream evolves for workload A using the algorithms DS NIPS/CI and ILC for different implication parameters In Figure a we show the results for minimum support   5 and  1  60 or  1  80 The different  1 are encoded in the parentheses next to identication of the algorithm in the legend of the graph In Figure b we increased the minimum support to   50 We observe that the behavior of DS varies widely while NIPS/CI remains always below the expected 10 error DS actually keeps a sample of the distinct elements seen so far and tries to scale the implication count that holds for that sample to the whole set of distinct elements In most cases the data in the sample is not representative of the implication The situation for DS is exacerbated when the minimum support increases where quite a lot of samples do not participate in the count making the scaling even more errorprone Algorithm ILC in all cases returned very erroneous results although it used much more space than NIPS/CI and DS since it tries to store not the implication counts but the actual implicated itemsets In these workload the implicated itemsets overwhelm its available memory which is actually larger than the amount given to NIPS/CI and DS In gure 7\(B we present the results of the algorithms for workload B The situation is still in favor of NIPS/CI whose relative error remains always close to the expected 10 unlike DS who returns highly skewed errors even though the domain cardinalities are much smaller and therefore keeps in the sample space much more data As expected from the analysis the error guarantees of NIPS/CI are virtually unaffected by changes in the cardinalities or the number of tuples seen so far in the stream ILC returns very erroneous results although now the cardinalities and the implicated items are much smaller compared to those of workload A The reason is not only because it keeps too much information in memory i.e all the implicated itemsets while both NIPS/CI and DS only hold a mantissa for the count but also because the constraint    rel is broken as the number of tuples increases 7 Related Work There are unique challenges in query processing for the data stream model Most challenges are the result of the streams being potentially unbounded in size Therefore the amount of the storage required in order to get an exact size may also grow out of bounds Another equally important issue is the timely query response required although the volumes of data the need to be processed is continually augmented at a very high rate Essentially the amount of computation per data item received should not add a lot of latency to each item Otherwise any such algorithm wont be able to keep up with the data stream In many cases accessing secondary storage such as disks is not even an option In  there is a discussion of what queries can be answered e xactly using bounded memory and queries that must be approximated unless disk access is allowed Sketching techniques\([14 ha v e been introduced to build summaries of data in order to estimate the number F 0 of distinct elements in a dataset In three algorithms that      approximate the F 0 are described with various space and time requirements Distinct is dri v e n by hashing functions similar to those studied in 14 and provides highly accurate results for distinct value queries compared to those taken by uniform sampling by using only a fraction of their sample size In the algorithms Stick y Sampling and Lossy Counting are introduced that estimate frequency counts with application to association rules and iceberg cubes In a framework for performing set expression on continuously updated streams based on sketching techniques is presented In a general framework over multiple granularities is presented for both range-temporal and spatio-temporal aggregations In a framework for identifying hierarchical heavy hitters i.e hierarchical objects like network addresses whose prexes denes a hierarchy with a frequency above a given threshold is described The effect of impications between columns has been emphasized in the system that identies correlated pairs of columns and soft-dependencies and has been proved very useful in query optimization 8 Conclusions We have presented a generalized and parameterized framework that can accurately and efciently estimate implication counts and can be applied to many scenarios To the best of our knowledge this is the rst practical and truly scalable approach to the problem Proceedings of the 21st International

Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART achieved a higher classification rate against this particular dataset A comparison of the knowledge representation produced by our method, PART and CBA has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the set of rules derived. Figure 4 represents the classifiers generated form the hyperheuristic datasets. Analysis of the rules sets indicated that MMAC derives a few more rules than PART and CBA for the majority of the datasets. In particular, the proposed method produced more rules than PART and CBA on 8 and 7 datasets, respectively. A possible reason for extracting more rules is based on the recursive learning phase that MMAC employs to discover more hidden information that most of the associative classification techniques discard, since they only extract the highest confidence rule for each frequent item that survives MinConf Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 6. Conclusions A new approach for multi-class, and multi-label classification has been proposed that has many distinguishing features over traditional and associative classification methods in that it \(1 that contain rules with multiple labels, \(2 evaluation measures for evaluating accuracy rate, \(3 employs a new method of discovering the rules that require only one scan over the training data, \(4 introduces a ranking technique which prunes redundant rules, and ensures only high effective ones are used for classification, and \(5 discovery and rules generation in one phase to conserve less storage and runtime. Performance studies on 19 datasets from Weka data collection and 9 hyperheuristic scheduling runs indicated that our proposed approach is effective, consistent and has a higher classification rate than the-state-of-the-art decision tree rule \(PART and RIPPER algorithms. In further work, we anticipate extending the method to treat continuous data and creating a hyperheuristic approach to learn  on the fly   which low-level heuristic method is the most effective References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00 © 2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
