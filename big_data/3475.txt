Abstract 
Classical centrality measures like betweenness closeness eigenvector and degree centrality are application and user independent They are also independent of graph semantics However in many applications users have a clear idea of who 
they consider important in graphs where vertices and edges have properties and the goal of this paper is to enable them to bring their knowledge to the table in deìning centrality in graphs We propose a novel combination of subgraph matching queries which have been studied extensively in the context of both RDF and social networks and scoring functions The resulting SMAC framework allows a user to deìne what he thinks are central vertices in a network via user-deìned subgraph patterns and certain mathematical measures he speciìes We formally deìne SMAC queries and develop algorithms to compute answers to such queries We test our algorithms on real-world data sets from CiteSeerX Flickr YouTube and IMDb containing over 6M vertices and 15M edges and show that our algorithms work well in practice I I 
NTRODUCTION Classic network centrality measures are deìned on graphs without semantical attributes Only the structural position of a vertex determines its centrality Unfortunately this means that much information present in real-world social networks is neglected when deciding which vertices are central In real-world social networks vertices have properties and so do edges For instance in Facebook vertices may represent males or females as well as country of origin and more Likewise edges in Facebook may reîect friend relationships or co-membership in a group On LinkedIn vertices may have properties such as job title number of years with an employer identity of an employer etc while edges may reîect direct links between people membership in groups co-worker co-author or other similar relationships that can be easily inferred from LinkedIn data In addition to self 
declared data provided by users of social networks there is also much ongoing work on the problem of inferring such vertex properties from social media information In many applications the combination of semantic properties of vertices and the semantical relationships between vertices is very important For example a LinkedIn marketing application being used by an auto parts company might consider a user to be important if is a purchasing executive at an auto manufacturer and he has been there for at least years and there exist 2 employees in company 
P u u a z 
   
who are connected to him in LinkedIn The auto parts company might in this case ascribe a score to s importance which is a function of and possibly a function of various attributes of including his salary position in the company etc However they may also look for other patterns e.g user is considered important if he is a VP of Production or higher at an auto-manufacturer and he has been there at least years and he is connected via a path of length 2 
P P u z u u z 
    
to at least 3 employees in the company via LinkedIn Here again a score might be ascribed to 
s importance that is dependent on the value of  And of course if the same person pops up in both patterns in general if the same person is important in many different patterns this might mean she is important for many different reasons they may want to bump up her importance score Existing centrality measures like betweenness centrality closeness centrality degree centrality and eigenvector centrality are incapable of directly supporting such user or application needs In this paper we propose SMAC short for Subgraph Matching and Centrality a framework where users can express their own notion of what nodes are important using a 
u z 
 
mix of structural properties of the graph as well as semantic properties This is done by three devices i users can specify a set of subgraph queries thus achieving certain structural requirements ii users can specify constraints on node properties e.g number of years a person has been at a company and iii users can specify how to score the importance of a node based on their needs Moreover in SMAC if an application so desires it can incorporate classical centrality measures of nodes or Klout scores in Twitter as node properties and then users of that application can ask queries and specify constraints on those properties e.g 
s betweenness centrality should exceed a threshold In short SMAC provides power to end users and app developers to ask queries that they could not 
u 
 
ask before which are useful and relevant to the users or applications With SMAC we allow 
for vertices as opposed to classical centrality measures which do not allow users to deìne their own notion of centrality This provides a new and different way to look at centrality measures We note that with a certain amount of ingenuity SMAC queries can be built on top of the SPARQL query language and solved by RDF database engines We brieîy describe how to do this in Section IV However our optimized algorithms showed to be up to 16 times faster than a famous RDF database query engine so called in experiments on real-world data Our algorithms extend exist

algorithm particularly in implementing the method that requires accessing a subgraph matching algorithm But triplestores are known to have a much lower performance than graph databases for answering subgraph matching queries 1 T riplestores are based on the traditional table-based database technology Subgraph matching requires self-joins on the table representing the link structure of the graph Even with B+-tree indexes these self-join operations are slow when the edge tables contain millions of entries Other related work 20 tries to nd topsubstitutions based on their own deìnition of score However these also cannot be applied to SMAC since we need a method to score vertices in SMAC Much work has also been done on subgraph matching in biological applications where there is interest in identifying genetic structures query graphs that match known genetic structures database Gallagher 24 pro vides a good introduction to problem variants and query algorithms Solnon  pro vides an o v ervie w of pruning techniques from the perspective of constraint programming While we based our deìnition of pattern-based centrality on a very basic deìnition of subgraph matching many other deìnitions and variants exist 27 A lar ger sub-area of subgraph matching is probabilistic subgraph matching  Here patterns are matched to graphs whose edges are absent but their existence is assumed with some probability Thus substitutions have assigned probability scores as well Using data from social network sites we can be pretty sure that connected people know each other in some way However if we have to infer the relation between people from other observations e.g attendance of events we could explicitly encode the uncertainty and use this information when computing centrality scores Probabilistic subgraph matching would be a good basis for such a kind of extended pattern-based centrality VI C ONCLUSION In most real world applications users understand their needs and their data better than anyone else They want a system that helps them identify nodes in a social network that are important according to the criteria that they articulate explicitly as opposed to theoreticians who neither know their application data or their speciìc mission needs The SMAC framework proposed here helps users to do precisely this Users or application developers can express subgraph queries with constraints and scoring functions  these express what is important to end-users or users of an application We propose a query language in which such users can express their needs We then propose three algorithms to solve the resulting problem of identifying the most important nodes in a network according to the stated SMAC queries The rst two algorithms and are simple algorithms However we propose an algorithm that elegantly and
