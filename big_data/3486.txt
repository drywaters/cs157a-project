   AbstractóIn recent years, virtualization technologies were settled faster than anyone imagined and got placed big areas in our lives. Virtualization is a technology that eliminates the uniqueness" dependency by creating an abstraction layer between the hardware and the software that runs on it. The aim of virtualization is to centralize the information system for facilitating administrative task while improving scalability Virtualization technology which allows more efficient use of existing physical hardware, as well as some advantages including cost reduction, labor loss and performance improvement contains several innovations in security, especially in system security. Software applications such as antivirus, firewall, end point security installed on the servers to ensure system security causes performance loss on the network and servers. Hence security applications must be implemented on virtualization layer hypervisor, Virtual Machine Monitor\to cover all the virtual system. In this paper, we aim to explain usage of Intrusion Detection Systems and Intrusion Prevention Systems in virtualization technologies and prologue possible security threats in virtual area  KeywordsóVirtualization, Virtual Machine, Intrusion Detection Systems, Intrusion Prevention Systems, System Security, Cyber Security  I  I NTRODUCTION  irtualization technology is discovered in the 1970s.  It fell out of favor, because computer equipment was very expensive and the "framework" machines were not suitable for virtualization. Researches and the use of virtualization technologies began to spread quickly in the early 2000s, along with hardware becomes much cheaper and being very easy access to all areas. Now, virtualization is in every area of information technologies There are many important benefits of the virtualization Applications can be transferred transparently, servers can be consolidated and overall system maintenance can be made while the system is running. General security level can be upgraded and the hardware costs can be reduced In this paper, besides innovations brought about by virtualization, virtualization techniques, security and virtualization security issues will be informed. Furthermore virtualization technologiesí effect on Intrusion Detection Systems \(IDS\d Intrusion Prevention Systems \(IPS\will be focused on Section II and III focus on the concept of security and the basic techniques used to ensure the security, intrusion detection and prevention systems, section IV presents the virtualization and usage areas of the virtualization, section V summarizes the virtualization security and the concept of virtual machine monitor \(VMM\ and finally the conclusion is presented in section VI II  S ECURITY O VERVIEW  Security in information technologies can be defined as taking the precautions to save data, provide the continuity of information system, provide privacy and protect the system from insideñoutside active and passive threats. Security requirements   Confidentiality   Reliability   Authentication   Integrity   Availability Many organizations establish the information technologies infrastructure as three tries which are network security, system security data and security Network security means that all activities in a network infrastructure from up to down undertake to protect the data stream and the current usage of the network assets \(network equipment, configuration and network policy\ and to ensure the integrity of all ongoing operations A system security involves the access and control of computer system's resources which includes hardware software applications, and operating system files. Data security means to protect data and information from to be processed by unauthorized access, misuse, modification and damages A  Ensuring Network security techniques Firewall A firewall is a software application system for personal usage or hardware-based special network security equipment for multiuser big organizations that detects the inbound and outbound network activity like a router by resolving the data headers and determining whether it should be allowed through or not over the network by predefined rule-based policy Virtual Private Network \(VPN A Virtual Private Network is a kind of network technology that provides private Benefits of the Virtualization Technologies with Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems Murat «al kan              Mustafa ÷zsiginan                  Emin Kugu Aeronautics and Space Technologies Institute  Aeronautics and Space Technologies Institute Aeronautics and Space Technolo gies Institute  Turkish Air Force Academy         Turkish Air Force Academy         Turkish Air Force Academy  Istanbul/Turkey              Istanbul/Turkey              Istanbul/Turkey  muratcaliskan2004@gmail.com         mustafaozsiginan@gmail.com          e.kugu@hho.edu.tr  V 


  and secure network connection for communication over a public network or Internet Clouds. VPN can connect multiple sites over local area and wide area for multipurpose communications such as Voice Over IP \(VOIP\, web services Intrusion Detection System \(IDS An intrusion detection system \(IDS\ is a software application or hardware-based network security system that monitors and analyzes all inbound and outbound network activities like TCP connection analysis, address matching, HTTP string and substring matching, packet anomaly detection, traffic anomaly detection and identifies suspicious traffic pattern that may describe malicious attack from anyone attempting to disturb the system Intrusion Prevention System \(IPS Intrusion Prevention System is also known as Intrusion Detection and Prevention System that included in all activities of intrusion detection system and also have the ability to take immediate action as to prevent/block intrusions that are detected based on a set of rules Web Filter A Web filter is a program that is monitoring an incoming web page to check the origin or content of it based on the set of rules determining whether some or all of it should be screen or not Unified Threat Management \(UTM Unified Threat Management  System  is an all in one security platform solution that provides the ability to protect network. Unified threat management is the evaluation of the traditional firewall and typically includes firewall, intrusion detection system, web filtering, antivirus application and so on in a single integrated security appliance product. Its advantages are low-price, easy management, singe product, all in one central security appliance for small organization Network Access Control \(NAC Network access control is an approach information security area that user based access control the all parts of a network by checking user identity user system security healthy and other end point security factors. It provides an effective system and network management ability against the unauthorized network access  B  Ensuring System Security techniques To ensure the system security, updated anti spam antivirus, data lost prevention software solution against virus unauthorized access, spam, spyware and malware software must be in use C  Ensuring Data security techniques To secure data, some encryption techniques must be used Not only stored data but also transferred data from side to side should be encrypted either symmetrically or asymmetrically and should be signed using digital signature With the evaluation of the information technology, there is a need to have comprehensive security strategies and integrated precaution systems Organizations primarily determine security needs and risks. They should generate their security policy and apply them to whole organizational units. In order to achieve the durability of the applied security policy, they should raise information security awareness of their users by having them attended to information security training activities After making these activities, organizations should apply their security policy over the information technology infrastructure consistently, monitor all network activities produce report about the major network and system events and update or upgrade the generated security policy if it is necessary III  I NTRUSION D ETECTION A ND P REVENTION S YSTEMS  Intrusion Detection is the proced ure to monitor every kind of instances and processes, analyze and decide them if they are violent or threat for the system  IP S sy ste m  m o n i t o rs  and detects all kind of actions, incoming and outgoing traffic over the network, determine types of network traffic then block/drop and allow the TCP package from inside to outside and vice versa based on the generated policy rule. Making these operations, it collects the events and processes as a knowledge base to improve the policy against the any kinds of inside and outside attacks Intrusion detection and prevention systems perform the following functions to ensure the security   They find security violations that cannot be identified and prevented system by the other security components   They determine beginning of the intrusions and attacks then immediately protect the system   They report the threat and unwanted traffic over the network They generate the alarm for the unauthorized access and report the weakness of the system. Another goal of IDS/IPS is to detect inside attacks or account theft very easily. If someone uses stolen account and acts in the system, IDS/IPS system generates an alarm for the misuse profile. Then, the system recognizes the injection attacker. This kind of feature is serving deter from system Intrusion detection systems operate as misuse detection and anomaly detection by comparing familiar and unfamiliar network attack pattern. A misuse refers known attack. For example, the intrusion detection system immediately detects those attackers attempting to overstep the web server in a way that means it is already trained. A misuse detection system can be identified normal and abnormal traffic from known attacks It compares network traffic snapshot pattern using sequences of the system call or other features of known attack. An anomaly is something out of the ordinary, e.g., abnormal network traffic which is actually caused by unknown attacks An anomaly detection system models normal behavior and identifies a behavior as abnormal \(or anomalous\ it is sufficiently different from known normal behaviors. [6   In this type of detection, there is a need to log event data for identifying the normal operation over network traffic If there is a well-defined policy installed on the IDS/IPS in the system, they protect the unwanted attacks, unauthorized access and malicious software attacks. But if they are configured unsuitable, they cause false positive alarms and degrade network performance IV  V IRTUALIZATION  Virtualization is a method that increase the hardware utilization rate by dividing the hardware into multiple logical pieces. It minimizes hardware dependence of the software 


  thereby reduce the costs of information systems. In addition virtualization improves the scalability of the system. General virtualization architecture is shown in Fig. 1 Besides the significant cost savings, another important benefit is dynamic load balancing capacity through the multiple file systems. Applications decelerate  or even come to a halt when processing bottlenecks occurred on conventional machines. Dynamic load balancing helps to ensure that such bottlenecks do not occur, thereby enables applications to run continuously without any disruption [1 Virtualization; physical resources designed to serve multiple virtual machines or multiple virtual machines may be installed on a single set of hardware, and adds to system idle hardware capacity, removes hardware dependency for software, thus a software solution that greatly reduces the cost of software and hardware Virtualization has serious acquisitions in information security area besides efficiency, functionality and permanence These benefits include server consolidation support by isolating applications from one another while sharing the same machine, improved system security by isolating vulnerable applications from other mission critical applications running on the same machine, fault resilience by migrating applications off of faulty hosts, dynamic load balancing by migrating applications to less loaded hosts, and improved service availability and administration by migrating applications before host maintenance so that they can continue to run with minimal downtime  A  Virtualization Areas There are three areas of information technology where virtualization is used commonly: network virtualization storage virtualization and server virtualization Network virtualization allows a real isolation of virtual networks by dividing and using the same infrastructu Link virtualization and node virtualization are two main components of network virtualization. Network virtualization plays a key role for the next generation internet [3   Storage virtualization virtualizes physical storage in an enterprise storage area network \(SAN\hese virtual containers which are decoupled from infrastructure can be used by applications in systems. Online migration and load balancing are also supported in storage virtualization Server virtualization simplifies the application computation by being wrapped inside virtual machines \(VMs Virtual machines can be run along with each other on a single hardwa ice oriented arch itect u r es a n d is olat ed systems can be enabled thanks to virtual servers  B  Benefits of Virtualization Network virtualization; splits network traffic into layers provides easy management and improves the quality of service. Deployment of network virtualization forces new necessities and increases networks monitoring and managing performan Storage virtualization; increases available storage space and does not allow idle storage. Also, storage virtualization uncoupled the rigidity of classical systems. Todayís data centers are more agile by dint of virtualized the storages  Fig. 1.General virtualization architecture and Virtual Machine Monitor \(VMM Server virtualization; provides software and hardware independent of system and allows the use of hardware resources through virtualization layer. More than one hardware work as if a single part like distributed systems Thus provides applications deployed transparently. New servers can be created from an existing template in a short time. The management of all servers in a center provides the elimination of some administrative difficulties. The cost of hardware and software reduces 40%. It provides the highest levels of scalability by reducing administrative and operational challenges V  V IRTUALIZATION SECURITY  Virtualization can help you in many ways to solve the security problems. However, in some ways virtualization can create more unsafe environments than physical systems in order to use many separate system components like virtual hardware, virtual machine monitor and physical resources by virtual system Virtualization technologies use abstract computing resources such as CPU and memory. These resources are used by IDSs while investigating intrusions [7   Server virtualization can increase the reliability of the whole system, by providing a variety of software to keep their virtual environment. A virtual system error does not affect other virtual systems and attacks are confined inside the virtual environment, thus security is improved As an example, Java applets running on the Java VM sandbox" environment can be given as a benefit of virtualization security in information. The sandbox restricts capabilities such as reading or writing to files on each local computer, starting or calling programs on each local computer and obtaining network connectivity to the same computer from which applets have been applicati on running on a virtual environment is restricted and the virtual machine system cannot interfere the own system Software installed on the server computers to ensure system security \(antivirus, I/O control, firewall\uses 


  performance decrease on server computers as well as on the network. Thus, security applications must apply on Virtual Machine Monitor \(VMM\layer by covering all virtual frameworks. VMM, by fulfilling the security requirements of all the virtual machines centrally, improve the virtual machines performance and consume less resource with same security level VMM, also called as hypervisor, is a software layer responsible for multiplexing a single physical machine to run several virtual machines on it Virtu a l Machin e Monit o r  is a highly privileged piece of software that runs either alongside or under an operating system. It is designed to be an efficient, isolated duplicate of the real physical machine  hy perv is or on v i rt u a li zation la y e r w i t h h a rd w a re a n d software architecture is also shown in Fig  In principle, virtualization involves the use of an encapsulating software layer \(Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor\which surrounds or underlies an operating system and provides the same inputs, outputs, and behavior that would be expected from an actual physical devi Current virtualization researches assume that the virtualization environment, such as the VMM, has knowledge of the software being virtualized, such as the guest OS. This knowledge can then be used to monitor the operation of the guest VM to determine its integrity and to correct any observed anomalies  Although VMM needs the control of all the resources, it uses a very small part of system resources for its own management, virtual machine management, control monitoring, and other operations One of the important features of VMM is the ability of capturing the system state and restore. Each virtual machine image can be captured very quickly and whole virtual machine can be restored very quickly \(named as ìsnapshot these mean that only copying the files for a VMM and it is as easy as a file transfer The snapshot feature provides the advantages of the ability of restoring many previous system states, malware analysis honey pot and intrusion detection system usage While physical systems require additional hardware and reinstall a software system when copying a machine, this operation is not different from copying a file for a VMM It is impossible to differentiate the copied machine from the real one. However, unauthorized and unwanted copies cause name and address confusion on the network. That unwanted copies own the same rights to the actual machine and carry risks for the system. This problem jeopardizes the data and system confidentiality, integrity and availability and causes load balancing problems. In addition, these unauthorized copies complicate the measurements of intrusion detection systems that monitor known and valid virtual machines Due to being hardware-independent, multiple virtual machines can be installed on a single hardware kit. Separation of hardware and software adds inherent safety advantages to the virtualization There are two operation modes for VMM-based intrusion detection systems: Calibration and test. In calibration phase abnormal activities are recorded using machine learning techniques. In the testing phase, matching of the normal model operations and the model produced in the calibration phase is test  Since VMM covers all virtual machines system, possible threat on VMM will put at risk the whole system and everything running on it. Some features that VMM falls under the danger are confidentiality, integrity and availability Not only virtual machines but also VMM is at risk for privacy aspect. The operating systems on the same level or above the VMM can observe the VMM operations and intervene. In this case, the system hardware may also be at risk If VMM is at risk about integrity, all virtual machines and hardware are also at risk again. A system is only as strong as the weakest link power, if this weakest link is top link, it can be say easily ìsystem is weak System can serve as long as the VMM be able to survive against Denial of Service attacks. When VMM is interrupted all the machines running on the system will be affected. In this case, some of the system data loss and data corruption can occur. Software errors and bugs in VMM and scarcity of resources \(RAM, CPU, bandwidth etc.\will have suffered the effect of DoS attacks and will stop the service To ensure the security of the virtualized systems and eliminate some of the disadvantages which derive inherently some methods must be used. For secure hardware of system attestation must be used for verification where supported, all physical accesses must be controlled, unnecessary hardware must be removed. For operating system security, all patches must be applied, disks must be full encrypted if possible unnecessary services and software must be removed and disabled. For hypervisor security, attestation and integrity checks must be used, hypervisor must be monitored for signs of compromise. For virtual machine security, virtual machines must be prevented from utilizing physical resources, allocation of physical resources must be allocated VI  C ONCLUSION  From a security perspective, virtualization is a doubleedged sword. While some of the virtualization features occur security problems, much vulnerability are no longer a problem owing to virtualization applications. Virtualization security should be handled carefully. Systems isolation from each other brings simplicity on manageability issues, but if this operation is not handled with careful planning and practice, many dangerous situations can occur. While carefully planned, wellconsidered, consistently observed and well-managed virtual systemís security level is high, in the opposite case system might be completely at risk Against the possibility of making some security remissness some precautions should be taken to eliminate these risks Virtualization technologies offer many advantages to intrusion detection and prevention systems due to ability of monitoring snapshot, inspection of records and restore. By using these features, intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems monitor the traffic in the network, learn the normal behavior patterns, detect and prevent abnormalities more successfully 


  In general, Host Intrusion Detection System \(HIDS\nd Network Intrusion Detection System \(NIDS\widely used in computer security for different purpose that defending whole system which is included network and hosts and only host base systems. Likely for defending virtual hosts and virtual machine monitor can be used HIDS and NIDS at the same time. If HISD is wanted to use for defending hosts HIDS should be install both VMs and VMM for ensuring full protected system. In this technique, there could be lost a bit of system performance. In contrast, If only NIDS is desired to use for defending virtual system, it could be required to make provision for VM For ensuring full protected system, it could be best way to use NIDS in front of the Virtual system and install HIDS into VMM with the using Virtualization technologies advantages R EFERENCES  1  E.

function MAP  impr  E MIT  impr 1  impr   src  dest  end function function REDUCE  impr  counts  sum  0 for c in counts do sum  sum  c end for out put   impr  src  impr  dest  sum  E MIT  out put  end function Figure 8 Impression counting using a traditional MapReduce implementation The mapper emits each src,dest impression with a count of 1 for the value The reducer is iterator-based  It receives the counts grouped by src,dest and sums them to arrive at the total number of impressions for each src,dest  The map takes a value of type v 1 and outputs a list of intermediate key-value pairs having types k and v 2  The reduce function receives all values for a particular key and outputs a list of values having type v 3  Figure 8 presents an example implementation for counting src,dest  impressions using MapReduce The map function emits src,dest as the key and 1 as the value The reduce function receives the values grouped by each src,dest and simply sums them emitting src,dest,count  This example uses an iterator-based interface for the reduce implementation In this approach an interface representing the list of values is provided to the user code The user code then iterates through all values present in the list An alternative to this is the accumulator-based interface which has the same expressiveness as the iteratorbased interface  26  An e xample of the accumulator based approach is shown in Figure 9 Next we will present how the programming model differs in Hourglass Hourglass uses an accumulator-based interface for the reduce implementation Additionally the functional expression of reduce is slightly different from that of general MapReduce  map  v 1    k  v 2   reduce  k   v 2    k  v 3  The map function here is the same as in the MapReduce programming model The reduce function is less general because it can output at most one record and each record must consist of a key-value pair In fact the key k is implicitly included in the output of the reducer by Hourglass so the user code only needs to return the output value An example of a finalize implementation is shown in Figure 10 The map operation retains the same functional deìnition because Hourglass hides the underlying details and only invokes the userês mapper on input data The mapper for the partition-collapsing job passes the previous output to the reducer without user code being involved Likewise the mapper for the partition-preserving job attaches the partition identiìer to the output of the userês map function before sending it to the reducer The reduce operation differs principally because the partition-collapsing job is more efìcient if it reuses the previous output Reusing the previous output implies that it function INITIALIZE  return 0 end function function ACCUMULATE  sum  impr  count  return sum  count end function function FINALIZE  impr  sum  out put   impr  src  impr  dest  sum  E MIT  out put  end function Figure 9 Impression counting using an accumulator-based interface for the reduce operation To sum the counts for a particular src,dest pair initialize is called rst to set the initial sum to zero Then accumulate is called for each count emitted by the mapper where for each call the current sum is passed in and a new sum is returned When all counts have been processed the nal sum is passed to the finalize method which emits the output function FINALIZE  impr  sum  return sum end function Figure 10 A simpliìed finalize method for the accumulator-based interface used in Hourglass Here finalize does not need to return the src and dest values because they are implicitly paired with the return value must pass through the mapper By forcing the output to be in the form key,value  it is possible to pass the data through the mapper without the developer having to implement any custom code Otherwise the developer would have to implement a map operation for the previous output as well making the implementation more complicated and exposing more of the underlying details of the incremental code This conîicts with the goal of having a simple programming model To reuse the previous output Hourglass requires that a merge operation be implemented if it is an append-only sliding window job The xed-length sliding window job in addition requires that an unmerge operation be implemented in order to reuse the previous output  merge  v 3  v 3    v 3   unmerge  v 3  v 3    v 3  These functions take two parameters of type v 3  the output value type of the reducer function merge combines two output values together unmerge effectively is an undo for this operation Given an output value it can subtract another output value from it Figure 11a shows an example of merge for the last login problem described previously Given the previous last login and the last login for the new set of data just processed it computes the maximum of the two and outputs this as the new last login Figure 11b shows an example of merge and unmerge for computing impression counts Given the previous output count and the count from the new intermediate data merge sums them to produce a new count Using this count and the oldest intermediate count corresponding to the previous window unmerge subtracts the latter from the former to produce the count over the new window F Capabilities Hourglass can be used to incrementalize a wide class of sliding window problems Recall that sliding window 747

count return curr count end function function UNMERGE  curr count  old count  curr count  curr count  old count return curr count end function b Figure 11 Examples of merge and unmerge functions for computing a last-login and b impression counts problems have the property that the input data is partitioned and the computation is performed on a consecutive sequence of these partitions We can express the reduce operation as reduce  x i   x i  1      x j   where x i is the list of map output data derived from one of the input partitions and   represents concatenation If the reduce operation can be represented as an associative binary operation  on two data elements of type M  then the previous reduce computation can be replaced with the equivalent reduce  x i   reduce  x i  1    reduce  x j   Assuming that  has the closure property and that an identity element i  also exists  then together  M    form a monoid 15 Splitting the reduce operation in this way translates directly to the rst and second passes described earlier for Hourglass where the rst pass is partition-preserving and the second pass is partition-collapsing The rst pass produces partial results and saves these as intermediate data The second pass computes the nal result from the intermediate data A binary operation  with identity i  is easily expressible using an accumulator-based interface Therefore if the reduce operation for a sliding-window problem can be represented using a monoid then it can be incrementalized as two passes with Hourglass Either type of sliding-window problem can be incrementalized this way There are many problems that can be expressed using monoid structures For example integers along with any of the min max addition and multiplication operations form monoids Average can also be computed using a monoid structure There are also many approximation algorithms that can be implemented using monoid structures such as Bloom lters count-min sketches and HyperLogLog Assuming the reduce operation can be represented as a monoid consisting of  M     then the merge operation described earlier can also be represented using the same monoid with binary operation   This means that an appendonly sliding window job can be implemented with just a single partition-collapsing job as merge enables reuse of the previous output making an intermediate state unnecessary Recall that for the xed-length sliding window the second pass partition-collapsing job can only reuse the previous output if an unmerge operation is implemented Unfortunately having the monoid property does not by itself mean that the unmerge operation can be implemented However if the monoid also has the invertibility property then the monoid is actually a group and unmerge can easily be implemented from merge by inverting one of the two elements For example for the addition of integers we can deìne merge  x  y   x  y  Using the invertibility property we can deìne unmerge  x  y   x  y  Therefore if the reduce operation for a xed-length sliding window problem can be represented using a group the problem can not only be incrementalized using two passes but the second pass partition-collapsing job can reuse the previous output Addition and multiplication of integers and rational numbers form a group It is also possible to compute the average using a group structure This makes Hourglass well suited for certain counting and statistics jobs operating over xed-length sliding windows IV E VALUATION Four benchmarks were used to evaluate the performance of Hourglass All used xed-length sliding windows The rst benchmark evaluated aggregation of impression data from a Weibo recommendation training set  12  o n a local singlemachine Hadoop 1.0.4 installation The remaining three benchmarks were run on a LinkedIn Hadoop 1.0.4 grid that has hundreds of machines The second benchmark evaluated aggregation of impressions collected on the LinkedIn website for the People You May Know PYMK feature which recommends connections to members The third evaluated aggregation of page views per member from data collected on the LinkedIn website The fourth evaluated cardinality estimation for the same page view data Two metrics were collected for each benchmark Total task time is the sum of all map and reduce task execution times It represents the amount of compute resources used by the job Wall clock time is the execution time of the job from the time setup begins until the time cleanup nishes Because Hourglass uses two MapReduce jobs for xed-length sliding windows the metrics for the two jobs were summed together A Weibo Impressions Benchmark The Weibo recommendation training data  12  consists of a set of item recommendations These were partitioned by day according to their timestamp producing data spanning a month in time For this benchmark we evaluated several lengths of sliding windows over the data In addition we evaluated Hourglass with and without output reuse enabled in order to evaluate its impact A simple MapReduce job was also created as a baseline The mapper and accumulator used for Hourglass are shown in Figure 12a and Figure 12b Figure 13a presents a comparison of the total task time as the sliding window advanced one day at a time Although the 7 day window results for the Hourglass jobs are intermittently 748

intermediate aggregation Both variations were evaluated when previous output was reused RO and when it was not reused NR For total task time in a there was not a signiìcant difference between the two variations when reusing output RO The total task time for each variation averaged about 40 of baselineês For Two Pass V2  the job which does not reuse output NR is improved over the corresponding Two Pass V1 variation It improved so much that it was almost as good as the version which reuses output RO For the wall clock time in b the Hourglass jobs consistently have a higher wall clock time than baseline The output reuse cases RO perform better than the cases that do not reuse output NR with about a 40 higher wall clock time than baseline Figure 14a presents comparisons of the total task time for the two variations against the baseline MapReduce job The Hourglass jobs consistently perform better for both variations The job that reuses output performs best showing a clear improvement over the job that does not reuse output For the second variation the performance of the two jobs is similar This implies that considering total task time alone after the intermediate data is aggregated there is only a small beneìt in reusing the previous output Figure 14b presents comparisons of the wall clock times for the two variations against the baseline MapReduce job Unlike total task time for this metric the Hourglass jobs consistently performed worse Between the two the variation that reused output performed best This is different than the results of the Weibo benchmarks where Hourglass improved both metrics for large window sizes However the difference between the Weibo and PYMK benchmarks is that the latter ran on a cluster with hundreds of machines which allowed for better parallelism In this particular case there is a tradeoff between total task time and wall clock time It is worth considering though that reducing total task time reduces load on the cluster which in turn improves cluster throughput So although there may be a tradeoff between the two metrics for this job in isolation in a multitenancy scenario jobs might complete more quickly as a result of more compute resources being made available C Page Views Benchmark At LinkedIn page views are recorded in an event stream where for each event the member ID and page that was viewed is recorded  23  F o r this benchmark we computed several metrics from this event stream over a 30 day sliding window The goal was to generate for each member over the last 30 days the total number of pages viewed the total number of days that the member visited the site and page view counts for that member across several page categories Examples of page categories include proìle company group etc Computing aggregates such as these over xedlength sliding windows is a very common task for a largescale website such as LinkedIn As the task computes a xed-length sliding window partition-preserving and partition-collapsing Hourglass jobs were used The key used was the member ID and the value was a tuple consisting of a page view count a days visited count and a map of page category counts To evaluate the performance of Hourglass a baseline MapReduce job was also created Figure 15 compares the performance of Hourglass against the baseline job As in previous examples the rst iteration of Hourglass is the most time consuming Although total task time for the rst iteration was about the same as baselineês wall clock time was twice as much For subsequent iterations however total task time and wall clock time were substantially lower than baselineês Total task time was between 2 and 4 of baselineês wall clock time was between 56 and 80 of baselineês D Cardinality Estimation Benchmark The page views data from the previous example can also be used to determine the total number of LinkedIn members who accessed the website over a span of time Although this number can be computed exactly for this benchmark we use the HyperLogLog algorithm  7  o produce an estimate With HyperLogLog one can estimate cardinality with good accuracy for very large data sets using a relatively small amount of space For example in a test we performed using a HyperLogLog implementation  9  that includes improvements to the original HyperLogLog algorithm cardinalities in the hundreds of millions were 750

job for the page views aggregation task The window length used was 30 days Several runs were performed for each iteration The minimum values of total task time and wall clock time across all runs are plotted normalized by the baseline value of each iteration Total task time for the rst iteration of Hourglass is about 5 greater than baselineês within the margin of error Subsequent iterations however have total task times which are in the range of 2 and 4 of baselineês which reîects a substantial reduction in resource usage Wall clock time for the rst iteration of Hourglass is about double that of baselineês a result of having to run two MapReduce jobs sequentially However subsequent iterations have wall clock times between 56 and 80 of baselineês estimated to within 0.1 accuracy using only about 700 kB of storage HyperLogLog also parallelizes well making it suitable for a sliding window  7  F o r this benchmark an implementation based on HyperLogLog was used We estimated the total number of members visiting the LinkedIn website over the last 30 days using a sliding window which advanced one day at a time Since only a single statistic was computed the key is unimportant we used a single key with value members The value used was a tuple of the form data,count  The count here is a member count The data is a union type which can be either a long value or a byte array When the type is a long it represent a single member ID and therefore the corresponding count is 1L  When the type is byte array it represents the serialized form of the HyperLogLog estimator and the count is the cardinality estimate The advantage of this design is that the same value type can be used throughout the system It can also be used to form a monoid The implementation of the mapper and accumulator is straightforward The mapper emits a tuple memberId,1L for each page view event The accumulator utilizes an instance of a HyperLogLog estimator When the accumulator receives a member ID it offers it to the estimator When it receives a byte array it deserializes an estimator instance from the bytes and merges it with the current estimator For the output it serializes the current estimator to a byte array and includes the cardinality estimate The partition-preserving job used this mapper and in addition used the accumulator for its combiner and reducer The partition-collapsing job used an identity mapper which passed the data through unchanged It also used the accumulator for its combiner and reducer Using the accumulator in the combiner greatly reduces the amount of data which has to be sent from the mapper to the reducer A basic MapReduce   Task Time  Wall Clock Time                               0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Iteration Ratio Job

minimum values of total task time and wall clock time across all runs are plotted normalized by the baseline value of each iteration Total task time for the rst iteration of Hourglass is roughly the same as baselineês within the margin of error Subsequent iterations however have total task times which are in the range of 2 and 5 of baselineês which reîects a substantial reduction in resource usage Wall clock time for the rst iteration of Hourglass is about 25 greater than that of baselineês However subsequent iterations have wall clock times between 58 and 74 of baselineês job was also created to establish a baseline for comparison It used the same mapper and accumulator implementations The HyperLogLog estimator was conìgured with a m value of 20 bits which is intended to provide an accuracy of 0.1 Figure 16 compares the performance of Hourglass against the baseline job for a 30 day sliding window computed over a period of 14 days Similar to the previous benchmark total task time is signiìcantly reduced for subsequent iterations For this benchmark it is reduced to between 2 and 5 of baselineês This reîects a signiìcant reduction in resource usage Wall clock times for subsequent iterations is reduced as well by a signiìcant amount V C ONCLUSION In this paper we presented Hourglass a framework for efìciently processing data incrementally on Hadoop by providing an easy accumulator-based interface for the programmer We evaluated the framework using several benchmarks over xed-length sliding windows for two metrics total task time representing the cluster resources used and wall clock time which is the query latency Using real-world use cases and data from LinkedIn we show that a 50Ö98 reduction in total task time and a 25Ö50 reduction in wall clock time are possible compared to baseline non-incremental implementations Hourglass is in use at LinkedIn and is freely available under the Apache 2.0 open source license R EFERENCES 1 P Bhatotia A
