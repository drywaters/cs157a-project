The method extracts information from the log f past submitted queries to search engines using algorithms for mining association rules Experimental results were performed on a og containing more than 2.3 million queries submitted to a commercial searching engine giving correct suggestions in 90.5 of the top 5 suggestions presented for common queries extracted from a real log 1 Introduction The Web has become an essential source of up-to-date information that covers almost all the topics a human could be interested in However the task of 223nding relevant information related to a given topic on the Web is dif\223cult The 
information available on the Web is not structured therefore the useful material related to any searched topic is always mixed with billions of Web pages with little or no interest Under this scenario Web search engines became one of the most popular service available on the Web Despite the recent advances on the technology of the search engines there are still many situations where the user is contemplated with non-relevant answers One of the great challenges faced by search engines is the dif\223culty in uncovering an exact description of the user need since users 
usually submit very short and imprecise query[9 A popular solution to help the users in the task of specifying their information needs is to use relevance feedback techniques 3 Thes e t echni ques i mpro v e t h e i nt eract i v i t y of the system by allowing users to inform about the elevance of answers given to their initial query The feedback information is used to re\223ne the initial query and get a better speci\223cation of the user needs A form of relevance feedback that has recently become 
popular in many search engines is to ow a list of related queries to the user initial query For instance if the user searches for 215 Madonna 216 in All the Web search engine 1 the following related queries are presented  215 madonna lyrics 216 215 madonna music 216 215 madonna mp3 216and\215 madonna wedding 216 The presentation of a list of related queries is an interesting feedback alternative because user can explicitly 
reformulates the query removing possible ambiguities or turning its query more speci\223c or just redirecting its query to another topic which is related to the initial query and that Despite of its raising popularity among search engines there is a lack of related work in the literature on how to get query suggestions automatically The objective of this paper is to present a method for automatically generate lists of related queries The method uses an algorithm for mining association rules from the log 
of past submitted queries to a search engine In our experiments we used a log containing more than 2.3 million queries submitted to rejador 2  a popular brazilian search engine Experimental results show that our method is both precise and useful It usually generates correct suggestions that retrieve relevant documents to the user Also we show that the same approach can be used to provide terms to the classic problem of query expansion 
This paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents related work Section 3 discuss the proposed method  Experimental results are presented in Section 4 Finally Section 5 presents the conclusions 1 http://www.alltheweb.com 2 http://farejador.ig.com.br Proceedings of the First Latin American Web Congress \(LA-WEB 2003 0-7695-2058-8/03 $17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

the user session is de\223ned as follows Each user is identi\223ed by the remote host 223eld its IP address and the session is de\223ned by the set of queries extracted from the URL 223eld  each user submitted divided in 000 minutes intervals according to the time 223eld To avoid queries from different users with the same IP address we only use sessions with a low number of queries in experiments we use session with only 10 queries Once the set of user sessions 001 is characterized we can now start the phase 2 of our method as described in next section 3.2 Mining Association Rules and Identifying Related Queries Before introducing our method to discover related queries we now brie\224y describe the problem of mining association rules We use an example formalized in 1 t o r e v is e t he needed concepts  T he e x ample is based on e problem of mining sales data called basket data Let 002 000 000 002 000 003\002 001 003 004\004\003 002 000 001 be a set o literals called items Let 005 be a database of transactions Each transaction 000 can be represented by a binary vector with 000 001 006 002 000 003 if 000 bought e item 002 001 and 000 001 006 002 000 004 otherwise Let 007 be a subset of 002  A transaction 000 satis\223es 007 if for all items 002 001 in 007  000 001 006 002\000\003  This statement can be rede\223ned for the problem of 223nding related queries Here the set 002 000 000 002 000 003\002 001 003 004\004\004\003 002 000 001 is a set of queries from log 223les and 005 is the the set of user sessions 000  For each 000 there is a binary vector 000 001 006 002 such that 000 001 006 002 000 003 if session 000 searched for query 002 001 and 000 001 006 002 000 004 otherwise A transaction 000 satis\223es 007 exactly as described in last paragraph By an association rule we mean the implication 007 002 b  where 007 003 002  b 003 002 and 007 004 b 000 005 Therule 007 002 b has a con\223dence factor of t if t 005 of the transactions in 005 that contains 007 also contains b  We will use the classical notation 007 002 b 006 t to specify that the rule 007 002 b has a con\223dence factor of c The rule 007 002 b has a support factor of 001 if 001 005 of the transactions in 005 contain 007 000 b  The problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have a support greater than an speci\223ed minimum support also called minsup 2  In the problem of 223nding related queries we are only interested in associations like 007 002 b where 007 003 002  b 003 002  007 004 b 000 005 and X and Y ave only one element We say that a query 002 002 is related to 002 003 if the transaction 007 002 b hasatleasta minsup where 007 000 002 002 and b 000 002 003  The intuition behind our method is as follows During a session the user de\223nes roughly his information need submitting a set of queries If distinct queries occur simultaneously in many user sessions these queries may be related Now for each query 002 001 we have a set of transactions  000 002 001 001 002 000 002 000 001 003 000 002 001 001 002 000 002 001 001 003 000 002 001 001 002 000 002 002 001 003 004\004\004\003 000 002 001 001 002 000 002 000 001  sorted by its con\223dence Then 002 001 related queries is the set 000 002 000 003\002 001 003\002 002 003\004\004\004\003\002 001 001 where 000 002 001 001\002\000 002 000 001\006 t\n 000 002 001 001\002 000 002 001 001\006 t\n 000 002 001 001\002\000 002 002 001\006 t n 004\004\004 n 000 002 001 001\002 000 002 000 001\006 t  It can be easily sorted by the frequency that each query appears in the same session of 002 001  This procedure is sti\223ed by the de\223nition of con\223dence and because our set of association rules has only one element for each transaction This is a very simpli\223ed form of using association rules however it provides us a formal framework for analyzing the query logs its implementation is ef\223cient enough to process huge log databases and as shown at the experiments presented here it produces good results This simple de\223nition allows our method to compute the relation between queries in an extremely fast way which means new association rules can be updated periodically to identify new groups of related queries This feature is important since the topics searched on the Web are dynamic and new relations may arise every day 4 Experimental Results We present in this section experiments to evaluate the quality of our method All experiments were performed using a log with 2,312,586 queries from a popular search engine in Brazil Farejador

It is easy to see that P AR MINER\(X is a natural parallelization of MINER\(X on a shared-nothing arc hitecture b y using our main idea men tioned b efore where X ma y be I or II This parallelization

Count Distribution is the fastest parallelization of Apriori  Ho w ev er Count Distribution con tains uncertainly m ultiple sync hronization p oin ts due to the sum-reduction at the end of eac h pass

  10 launched on the same 2110 Taurus vehicle configuration in 1999 with the KOMPSAT satellite  Orbital has flown numerous missions from the Mission Operations Center \(MOC\lles using the MAESTRO ground software for command and telemetry. The MOC is shown below in Figure 10. This software is hosted on Sun workstations running the Solaris operating system. The most recent missions are OV-3 and GALEX. Both programs are running smoothly and operating as planned. ACRIMSAT has recently converted over to using the MAESTRO system for operations as well. USN is supporting the GALEX mission, including X-band pass services at Hawaii and Australia. Glory will follow this proven path. USN has also supported most of Orbital’s geo-synchronous satellite launches and on orbit checkouts    Figure 10 – Orbital’s Mission Operations Center  6  S UMMARY   In the case of the Glory program, it is concluded that reuse of many components from the VCL program not only significantly reduces the cost of the Glory mission but helps to make something of what could be shelved for an indeterminate amount of time.  By employing existing resources and knowledge from a program that was very mature, the Glory program is doing its part to contribute to cost saving measures and maximizing benefit to NASA. The Glory program provides savings of nearly $15M over a ground-up bus design effort, while mitigating significant risk on the bus portion of the mission  Glory is an ideal mission for ear th sciences in the realm of climate change research. It draws from significant flight heritage elements in both th e instruments and the spacecraft bus. It uses an existing NASA asset with minor refurbishment to save significant development costs. It uses a LV that has flown several NASA and DOD missions to date. The ground system employs flight proven hardware and software with a robust plan for backup coverage   7  R EFERENCES   NASA Facts Aerosols June 1999   NASA Godda rd Space Flight Center Glory Program Science and Mission Requirements Document  Greenbelt, Maryland, February 2, 2004  8  B IOGRAPHIES   Darcie A.
