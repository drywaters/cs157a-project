With the increasing amount of data, the record linkage has become a challenge for big data integration Similarity join is an efficient approach to address the record linkage, but it is hardly achieved by the single node environment. In this paper, we propose a framework based on MapReduce for set similarity join. The techniques of framework improve the efficiency from two aspects: reducing candidate pairs and load balance. In reducing candidate pairs 
 
we propose algorithms that combines multiple filtering principles to reduce the amount of candidate pairs. It includes length filter, prefix filter and position filter. The techniques for load balance are used to address the skew data and decrease the replication transfer volume. Experimental results on real dataset show that our approaches can achieve the speed-up over previous algorithms on big data

I I NTRODUCTION Similarity joins is one of effective approaches for linking different records expressing the same entity from the same or 
different data sources. It can be applied to data integration and many other applications, such as plagiarism check duplicated webpage document clustering, and social network user identification. However, with the increasing scale of data in applications, traditional centralized approaches have the limitations of scalability on the memory and capability In similarity joins, the similarities between records are determined by similarity functions. According to the data features, different applications require different similarity functions, and the filter algorithms should be designed based on similarity algorithms. This paper mainly focuses on set similarity join problems for the textual similarity with tokenbased algorithms. In existing studies, the process of similarity join mainly contains two parts of works: generate 
candidate pairs and verify candidate pairs. In candidate generation phase, the goal is to filter record pairs that can't be matched, which can minimize the amount of candidate record pairs in calculating the similarities. Therefore, current works rely on effectively filtering the candidate pairs[2,3,4,5  to improve the performance of similarity join. Then, the verification phase is to calculate the similarity of candidate pairs and compare it with the given threshold. However, to address the problems from large-scale data, it needs to execute similarity joins in parallel. Recently, several techniques have been proposed for the similarity join based on the MapReduce framework that provides the ability of processing massive data in distribution. Existing approaches for similarity join focu on the algorithms of filtering record 
pairs and separating them into different blocks and distributing them into multiple nodes to process. But the performance is always surfer from the data skew which decreases the benefit of distributed processing In this paper, we propose a framework based on MapReduce to process set similarity joins efficiently. The contributions of this paper are as follows 
We extend the prefix filter and propose a new prefixbased algorithm that can efficiently filter candidate pairs and be applied in the MapReduce framework To address the data skew, we propose a task estimation-based load-balancing model, which solves the high differences of a single task execution time due to imbalance task distribution in candidate

validation phase, and reduces the transmission of replications 
Extensive experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approaches The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the related works. Section 3 presents the preliminaries. Section 4 and 5 give our proposed algorithms that integrated improved prefix filter with other filter principles and algorithms for load balance. The implementation of framework based on MapReduce is presented in Section 6. We present our experimental results in Section 7 Section 8 concludes the paper II R ELATED W ORKS Set Similarity Join \(SSJoin\ is defined as follows: Given

method. Thus existing works on the similarity join focus on algorithms based on the overlap of two token sets[4  su ch as  Jaccard algorithm There are two popular methods in solving the Set similarity problems: Local Sensitive Hash and Prefix Filtering. LSH is appropriate for the joins with lower threshold [5,6 w h ile th e  p r ef ix f ilt er in g is su pe ri or in  a higher threshold for the exact case. Considering that seldom pairs satisfy the higher threshold in all candidate pairs recent research works 3,4,7,8,9  focus on decreasing the amount of the candidate pairs to reduce the overall computational complexity

The length filter and prefix hash algorithm proposed in [4  are effective to solve the problem of large amount of candidate pairs. In addition, the position information of prefix introduced in [8 f il te r s th e f a lse c and id at e p ai r s th at  have passed the length-filter. [9 pr o p o se d an op tim izati on  t o  further reduce the number of candidate pairs to be verified utilizing the feature of min-prefix information. In [1   different types of strings have different characters based on the adaptive selection of pref ix length, which is highly universe but took much time in selecting the length of prefix Besides, to reduce network traffic, [3 m a p p ed th e r e c o r d s  into a vector utilizing hash signature. This method avoids statistical analysis of information and decreases the number position information MapReduce framework has been applied to improve the runtime efficiency of the record linkage for the big data. A MapReduce implementation of set similarity proposed in [11  includes three stages, computing data statistics, outputting RID pairs of similar records and generating actual pairs of joined records. Dealing with large documents, [1  investigated the virtual node method. Two load balance methods have been put forwa rd for entity resolution, of which block split is simpler than pair range, but both considering Cartesian product[14   Th e  pa pe r  1 3   p r es ente d  a balanced cost model, and grouped data in accordance with the cost model III P RELIMINARIES The function takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key-value pair. Then the MapReduce library groups all intermediate values associated with the same key and passes them to the Function. The function accepts an intermediate key and a set of values for that key. It merges these values into a smaller set And the function iterates the set and produces a keyvalue pair as the output. Finally, the MapReduce rewrites the generated key-value pairs to the file system Let and be token sets from two strings and the Jaccard similarity of and is computed by following formula 1 The positional filters are proposed based on the Jaccard similarity. Suppose  are the size of record and respectively is the threshold of the similarity between two strings   denotes the prefix of Note that  and the  is tokens from to in S. According to prefix filter principle, given an arbitrary pair if its similarity has the prefixes of and must have at least one common token. Map set into different buckets based on the symbol token in position of the prefix as The same process is done with This ensures that pairs with common tokens are mapped into at least one bucket  As shown in Figure 2, according to Formula 1, the size of two sets union is at least 1, which means there are at least symbols in that are not in The size of the intersection is at most 1 since it is the number of symbols of that could possibly be in For the similarity must be at least  thus it must satisfy     Suppose has suffix length and has suffix length  When the maximum size of the intersection is 1  Since we can regard the above expression as 1. The minimum size of the union is  1, so it needs to satisfy formula 2. When in the same way, it needs satisfy formula 3 2 3 Let us consider the above facts that transforming the inequality    is effective to prune the number of

the candidate pairs. Therefore we can propose a proper way to find an estimated expression that is more approximate to the real value, and get a better filter performance IV I MPROVED SIMILARITY JOIN ALGORITHM BASED ON PREFIX FILTERING   Considering the number of the common prefix of any two strings that may have more than one common prefix, an efficient way is that just computes them in one bucket based on one common symbol and filter other candidate pairs. As shown in Figure 3  nd  ave two common symbols and the positions of is ahead of the positions of in and Therefore the computation for the prefix must have been dealt in the bucket, so the computation in the bucket is redundant common prefix or the estimated size of the intersections that is close to the real length, so it brings larger number of candidate pairs to be verified. In this paper, we use the symbols indexed information to filter candidate pairs and has the common symbol in prefixes with position in and position in If the positions  are not the first common key in prefix, we will accurate we estimate the ratio of the intersections and the union of the two stings So we propose the denoted as    and it has the property       Therefore, if    must be lower than and the pair   Different from the position filter, we can make a full scan for the prefix in the candidate pairs to calculate the number of the same key in the two prefixes, prefix prefix  Assume is the suffix of and is the suffix of The maximum number of intersections is  d the minimum number of the unions is    If  the filtering condition is      and If  the filtering condition       So, we define the   Formula 4    is not smaller than    We define as the common symbols of the two prefixes if the candidate pair is above the threshold is not bigger than and is not bigger than And in the same way   is not smaller than 1 for   1 and   That means        in which   is the estimate similarity of position filter Our   is more close to the real similarity value    so the appjoin filter principle is more efficient than ppjoin and ppjoin+ filter  we have  1 as the prefix of set from the prefix filtering principle. In Figure 5 suppose there is only one common symbol in prefixes, it means that all the suffix in and in must be all the same larger than If we regard additional symbols as the extension of the prefix, the number of common prefix must be larger than 1 based on the pigeonhole principle. But it would lead to more replication of records. Then we propose the  n which we still use the original length as prefix but taking the information about another keys in a bitmap. Like the filter it scans the number of the common prefix of the candidate pairs \(denoted as c\. Here we will make an intersection between two bitmaps and get the number of common ones in the n keys\(denoted as And then comparing with  we can make a better filtering if the  is smaller than 1 For the threshold and the similarity if is smaller than we have that  Based on the expression, we learn that the bigger are selected, the approximate is lower to select more than 1 common symbols in the candidate pair whose similarity is below So a proper is required to balance the cost of computation and effects of filtering As we known the probability of arbitrary element in a set existing in another set is equal to the similarity of the two

sets. Given the threshold if is smaller than we have that It is suggestive to select a proper balancing the cost of computation and effects of filtering Our pipeline filter framework mainly focuses on the computational complexity. It integrates the    and filters in ascending order of computational complexity. As long as the candidate pair dissatisfies one of the filters, the pair is filtered out Here we hash the symbols of the prefix and additional symbols into one bitmap whose size is more than the 5 to 10 times of the prefix length to avoid hash collision V A LGORITHM FOR L OAD BALANCE The performance of MapReduce jobs need to consider two factors: the amount of m essages transmission and the data skew With our filters, the transmission of replications can be reduced. This section presents the technique of load balance to partition the skew data based on the cost estimation of task. The cost model of Load balance is given as follows The cost of a given task in generating candidate pairs is defined asT, where is the number of keys and is the number of the values shared with the same key. Suppose the number of reducers is the number of keys received by each reducer is to and the number of values corresponding to each key is we can get the computation cost in each reducer  thus  Based on the above expressions, we have the difference of computation cost between two reducers 5 Figure 6 Example of the task schedul balance large if all the high frequent keys are hashed to the same reducer. Figure 6 displays an example in which the tasks in each reducer are skew. So we give a load balance technique using knapsack problem to estimate the potential cost It is hard to guarantee that tasks are uniformly distributed to reducers. Since the cost depends on the largest task, this problem is similar to the task-scheduling problem that aims to minimize the time cost of all the tasks finished in parallel If the number of keys received by each reducer is almost the same, then the reducers are balanced. It firstly sorts the task list in a descending order of cost and then initiates the amount of task slots. Iterating the sorted task list, we always get the unassigned task with bigger amount and put it into the task slot with less task amount. In general, all the prefix keys are grouped to reducers having almost the same task amount VI I MPLEMENTATION OF F RAMEWORK In this section, we present the implementation of our framework based on MapReduce. Our framework includes four stages: information statistic regroups the hash keys generate the verified pairs and link records In information collection, it is responsible for the token frequency statistics. It has two MapReduce phases for this process. The first phase computes the frequency of each token and the second phase sorts the tokens with their frequencies. The first map uses the Split function to divide each record into tokens and produce pairs The reducer shuffles the records and counts the number of each token And at the next phase of MapReduce, the map function swaps key and value and the reduce function shuffles the keys in increasing number and swap key and value again Here we use one MapReduce phase to regroup the hash keys for balancing the skew data. In the setup function, we load the token frequencies table into a sorted set Map: input all the items, and transform them into an ordered set, which is reserved as the input of next stage that generate verified pairs. Iterate the prefix and produce a tuple  1\ as the output. And there we will also produce   as the signature of the prefix of the record for the to further reduce the computation cost Reduce: count the number of records that contain the prefix The task amount is There are two methods that we can generate the regroup number of each key. If the prefixes of all the records are fitted in the memory, we use only one reducer. We record the key and task amount in the hash table. Another method is using reducers. If we ensure that the tasks in buckets of each reducer are balanced buckets into the shared buckets the total amount of task in each bucket has less differences And at the close function, we sort the keys based on the task amount in descending order. Based on the previous task assignment algorithm, we output    for each key in the hash table, in which is the hash function. In the next step of similarity joins, we load the mapping relation of partition function to conduct the map partition The above works can guarantee the validity of data packet. Meanwhile, it regroups the keys and balances the reduce tasks As shown in Figure 7, the token frequency table used in the Map stage could transform the original records into an

Arbitrary two elements of the hash result on each Reduce task may be an eligible candidate pair.

Each node is configured with 8GB memory and 3.1GHz four Core i3-2100 Processor with the operating system of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1\(Santiago supporting Gigabit Ethernet We use DBLP data and citeseerX data as the experimental datasets. The dataset consists of almost 1.2 million records in DBLP and 1.5 million records from citeseerX. And we also create  datasets with benchmark methods to enlarge the scale of datasets from the original dataset of citeseerX In this section, we use various sizes of experimental data to compare the performances of our methods with First, we compare the time cost of without load balance and with our load balance algorithm under variable-size of datasets. We set the threshold of similarity as 0.8 Figure 8 shows the results of time cost on different size of data sets It shows that our load balance method can achieve average 20% speed-up for similarity joins.

is used to evaluate the performance of these methods working on the same data set. And we specified the threshold is 0.8. From the results, we find that our method has better performance on a large data set. We illustrate the phenomenon that the large data set generates much more pairs and our filter method is more efficient to generate less candidate pairs in Figure 11. So our method can save more time in large data sets We also evaluate the performances of different methods under different similarity thresholds. We varied the threshold from 0.65 to 0.95 and gives a certain data size of 7 million the experiment includes the basic   balanced  d our method on the same data set. Figure 12 shows the cost time of the three methods in different threshol ds. These experimental results prove that our method performs better than both the basic method and the with load balance especially when the threshold has a lower value. The differences between the three m ethods are signature with the decrease of the threshold. Our method performs well in low threshold, because our method can filter more candidate pairs than  In this experience, we evaluate the performance of our method and find a better to promote the performance of the We set the threshold as 0.65 and 0.8, and the data set contains 5 million records. we varied N from 0 to 3 to test the elapse time of the  0 means the basic Figure 13 shows the experimental results in which there is an inflexion point when 2. The experimental results display that setting the value of 2 can achieve the lowest cost time, and it is also depends on the value of threshold. It proves that our method has scale ability and good performance than other methods VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper, the similarity join techniques for big data integration are proposed. Based on these techniques, we construct a filter framework that combines multiple filter algorithms and uses MapReduce to process similarity join tasks in parallel. Moreover, an estimate-based algorithm for load balance is proposed for the problem of data skew, and is also integrated into our framework . The experimental results show that our methods can enhance the efficiency of the candidate filter, and reduce the task network traffic and the task cost time In the future, we will make a further research on other similarity functions and the condition that suits to the lower threshold and large documents in MapReduce framework A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the National Basic Research 973 Program of China under Grant No 2012CB316201, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61033007, 61003060 the National Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China Grant No. 20120042110028 the MOEIntel Special Fund of Information Technology under Grant No. MOE-INTEL-2012-06 the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China under Grant No N100704001 R EFERENCES 1 A p a c h e Had oop  h ttp  h ad oop  a pa ch e org   2 J.

environment  6  as well as the airborne imagery we ha v e presented The results are promising showing good discrimination between vehicle classes although performance is degraded by vehicle camou\037age and low resolution imagery The framework is scalable in terms of feature sets and the amount of input imagery and computationally parallelisable as model matching operations are independent However the recognition software does require attention in several areas Firstly results show that a certain amount of confusion will exist between vehicle classes particularly camou\037aged military ones A con\036dence measure is required to facilitate decision making automatic or otherwise Secondly the requirement for a tight bounding box surrounding the potential vehicle places signi\036cant demands on the preceding modules A means needs to be found to remove the impact of clutter surrounding the vehicle from degrading recognition performance the socalled 223target delineation\224 problem We also need to make more effective use of ground-sample distance information when carrying out the model selection and recognition Although we demonstrate a system addressing a small subset of possible targets the potential exists for the set of model candidates to be signi\036cantly larger Further investigation of the associated impact on classi\036cation and execution speed is required V C ONCLUSION The work described in this paper is the 036rst stage in moving from fundamental interactive video cueing aids to behaviour characterisation and anomaly detection tools that wide area persistent surveillance will demand We have demonstrated the value of ADSS in con\036guring a solution to a particular problem from component algorithms The results show de\036nite promise and there is now a clear way forward for algorithm and systems development In future we intend to exercise our framework and algorithms in an airborne trial with a very high resolution wide area motion imagery sensor This will facilitate activity monitoring over a large area and allow us to carry out complex repeated ground behavior activities for subsequent analysis A CKNOWLEDGMENT The
