bshe@ntu.edu.sg Abstract MapReduce has become one of the most popular framework for building big-data applications It was originally designed for distributed-computing and has been extended to various hardware architectures e.g multi-core CPUs GPUs and FPGAs In this work we develop the rst MapReduce framework on the recently released Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor We utilize advanced features of the Xeon Phi to achieve high performance In order to take advantage of the SIMD vector processing units we propose a vectorization friendly technique to assist the auto-vectorization as well as develop SIMD hash computation algorithms Furthermore we utilize MIMD hyperthreading to pipeline the map and reduce phases to improve the resource utilization We also eliminate multiple local arrays but use low cost atomic operations on the global array for some applications which can improve the thread scalability and data locality We conduct comprehensive experiments to compare our optimized MapReduce framework with a state-of-the-art multicore based MapReduce framework Phoenix By evaluating six real-world applications the experimental results show that our optimized framework is 1.2X to 38X faster than Phoenix for various applications on the Xeon Phi I I NTRODUCTION Big data analytics has been identi“ed as an exciting area for both academic and industry We have witnessed the success of applying various high performance computing techniques using co-processors such as graphics processors GPUs  3 FPGAs 4 and the coupled CPU-GPU architecture  to solv e big data analytical problems In order to fully utilize the capability of those architectures developers need to write co-processor speci“c programming languages such as CUDA This may af fect de v eloper producti vity  maintenance costs as well as the code portability Therefore it is desirable to have high-performance accelerator systems with compatible software development and maintenance techniques that are compatible with existing CPU-baed systems Recently Intel released a new product family named Xeon Phi for high performance coprocessors It offers a much larger number of cores than conventional CPUs Furthermore it highlights the 512-bit width vector processing units VPUs and fully coherent L2 caches The Xeon Phi has already demonstrated its promising through adoptions in either speci“c applications 8 or supercomputer systems 9 10 Instead of optimizing individual applications like previous studies 8 we in v estigate a producti vity programming framework to facilitate the implementation of big data analytics tasks correctly ef“ciently and easily on Xeon Phi MapReduce has become a popular programming framework for big data analytics It was originally proposed by Google for simpli“ed parallel programming on a large number of machines Recently it has been extended to different architectures to facilitate parallel programming such as multicore CPUs 13 14 15 GPUs 16 17 18 19 the coupled CPU-GPU architecture FPGA 21 and Cell processors In this w ork we in v estigate the implementation and optimization of the MapReduce framework on Xeon Phi To the best of our knowledge this is the rst MapReduce framework speci“cally optimized for Xeon Phi Directly porting a multi-core CPU based MapReduce framework such as Phoenix to the Xeon Phi cannot fully utilize the hardware capability Because it is not aware of the advanced features of Xeon Phi such as the VPUs small L2 cache per core and small memory capacity To address these issues we develop MRPhi  the rst MapReduce framework on Xeon Phi with following features  We implement the map phase in a vectorization friendly way to take advantage of the SIMD VPUs  We develop SIMD hash algorithms to utilize the SIMD VPUs  We pipeline the map and reduce phases to improve the resource utilization  We eliminate local containers by using atomic operations on the global container in certain cases This mainly addresses the thread scalability issue due to the limited memory size for some applications  Based on the above four optimization techniques we develop a framework that either automatically applies optimizing techniques or provides useful suggestions to the users The rest of the paper is organized as follows We introduce the background in Section II Section III gives detailed implementations The experimental results are presented in Section IV We conclude this paper in Section V II B ACKGROUND A MapReduce Framework The MapReduce framework is originally designed for distributed computing Later  i t i s e xtended to other ar chitectures such as multi-core CPUs 13 14 15 GPUs 17 18 19 the coupled CPU-GPU architecture FPGA 21 and Cell processors 22 These dif ferent 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013

MapReduce frameworks share the common basic work”ow but differ in detailed implementation and optimization We introduce the basic work”ow of a MapReduce framework At the beginning a split function divides the input data across workers  On multi-core CPUs a worker is handled by one thread A worker usually needs to process multiple input elements Thus the map function is applied to the input elements one by one within a worker Such a call of the map function for an input element is called a map operation  Each map operation produces a set of intermediate key-value pairs Then a partition function is applied to these key-value pairs according to the keys After that in the reduce phase each reduce operation applies the reduce function to a set of intermediate pairs with the same key Finally the results from multiple reduce workers are merged and output B Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor The Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor was released in November 2012 It is based on Intel Many Integrated Core MIC Architecture The current released product is 5110P Overall the Xeon Phi 5110P integrates 60 x86 cores on the same chip Each core has a frequency of 1.05 GHz and supports 4 hardware threads The memory hierarchy of Xeon Phi is similar to a conventional multi-core CPU The memory refers to the main memory on the Xeon Phi which is shared and accessible for all cores The main memory size is 8 GB Each core has local L1 and L2 caches The L2 cache size is 512 KB per core Additionally on each core there are 32 512-bit vector registers Xeon Phi has been used to accelerate linear algebra and molecular dynamics Furthermore Xeon Phi coprocessors also start to play an important role for supercomputers such as STAMPEDE and T ianhe-2 10 In the follo wing we brie”y introduce the major features of the Xeon Phi 512-bit vector processing units VPUs Xeon Phi features 512-bit VPUs on each core Utilizing VPUs effectively is the key to deliver high performance The VPUs can be either exploited by manual implementations with SIMD instructions or auto-vectorization by the Intel compiler MIMD Massive thread parallelism Each core of the Xeon Phi supports up to 4 hardware hyper-threads Thus there are 240 threads in total The MIMD Multiple Instruction Multiple Data thread execution allows different threads to execute different instructions at any time Thus we can assign different workloads to different threads to improve the hardware resource utilization Coherent L2 caches with ring interconnection The interconnection on the Xeon Phi employs a ring architecture All L2 caches are coherent through the ring interconnection This design is able to improve the cache ef“ciency by trying to avoid expensive memory accesses when cache misses occur Atomic operations Atomic data types are well supported on the Xeon Phi For random memory accesses we nd that the overhead of atomic operations is almost hidden by the access latency Therefore it is reasonable to exploit the use of atomic operations However the memory size of the Xeon Phi which is only 8 GB is xed and small compared with the traditional main memory This may become a bottleneck when designing ef“cient algorithms We demonstrate such an issue for particular applications and use atomic operations to address this issue in Section III-E C Challenges of a Shared Memory MapReduce Framework on Xeon Phi State-of-the-art shared memory MapReduce frameworks on multi-core architectures such as Phoenix can be executed directly on the Xeon Phi without code modi“cation However we have identi“ed three major performance issues of Phoenix when porting it onto the Xeon Phi First Phoenix takes little advantage of the VPUs on the Xeon Phi The compiler is unable to vectorize the code effectively Second there are a large number of random memory accesses when building containers Third due to the limited memory 8 GB on the Xeon Phi Phoenix cannot scale to hundreds of threads when the intermediate result is large As a result running Phoenix directly on the Xeon Phi does not give good performance In our framework we propose various techniques to address these performance issues III O PTIMIZED M AP R EDUCE F RAMEWORK ON X EON P HI In this section we present our proposed MapReduce framework MRPhi  which is specially optimized for the Xeon Phi A Overview MRPhi adopts state-of-the-art techniques from the shared memory MapReduce framework and applies speci“c optimizations for the Xeon Phi coprocessor Overall we use a similar design as Phoenix to implement the basic MapReduce work”ow There are two major techniques from Phoenix adopted in our framework which are ef“cient combiners and different container structures Ef“cient combiners  Each map worker maintains a local container When an intermediate key-value pair is generated by a map function the reduce operator is immediately applied to that pair based on the local container This process is performed using a combiner  After that the partition is applied to each local container and multiple local containers are merged to a global container in the reduce phase Hash table and array containers  MRPhi supports two data structures for containers which are hash tables and arrays The array container is ef“cient when the keys are integers and in a xed range More importantly we propose four optimization techniques speci“c to the Xeon Phi as shown in Figure 1 The left part of the gure summarizes the ow of MapReduce framework while the right part shows the optimization techniques applied correspondingly On the right part the white boxes are the adopted combiners and containers from Phoenix while the dark boxes are our proposed optimization techniques  Vectorization friendly map phase MRPhi implements the map phase in a vectorization friendly way which 126 


Input Map Phase Reduce Phase Vectorization friendly map  Efficient combiners   Map Local container Global container Partition Reduce Result Hash table Array SIMD Hash w/o local arrays Pipelined map reduce   optional  compulsory Fig 1 Proposed techniques in dark box and their applicability in MRPhi clears the dependency between different map operations By doing this the Intel compiler is able to automatically vertorize multiple map operations to utilize VPUs  SIMD parallelism for hash computation Hash computation is implemented employing SIMD parallelism by using SIMD instructions  Pipelined execution for map and reduce phases In general the user-de“ned map function contains heavy computation workload while the reduce function has many memory accesses In order to better utilize the hardware resource with hyper-threading the map and reduce phases are pipelined  Eliminating local arrays For the array container when the array is large it introduces a number of performance issues due to local containers We address these issues by using atomic operations on the global array instead of using local arrays Note that these techniques are not applicable for all MapReduce applications Our framework is able to either automatically detect whether a speci“c technique is applicable or provide helpful suggestions to users at compilation time B Vectorization Friendly Map Phase Utilizing VPUs is critical to high performance on the Xeon Phi 8 F o r the MapReduce frame w ork itself e xcept the hash computation Section III-C there is little chance to employ SIMD instructions If the user de“ned map function contains loops we then leave it to the compiler for autovectorization otherwise we propose to implement the map phase in a vectorization friendly manner 1 N the number of map operations 2 elems the input array 3 pragma ivdep 4 for\(i  0 i<N i  5 the inlined map function 6 map\(data_t  7  some computation 8 emit_intermediate\(key value 9  10  11  Listing 1 Vectorization for multiple map operations within a worker Recall that in the map phase each thread or map worker processes multiple map operations We use directives to guide the compiler to vectorize multiple map operations Listing 1 shows the basic idea emit intermediate is a system-de“ned function for combiners The pragma ivdep line 3 tells the compiler to try to vectorize this for-loop This auto-vectorization can be effective if there is no dependencies between map operations from line 6 to 10 in Listing 1 However if multiple emit intermediate operations are performed concurrently the execution will cause the write con”ict on a local container This con”ict exists for both the array and hash table containers   Map op. 1  Comp emit_I  Map op. 2  Comp emit_I  Map op. 3  Comp emit_I  Map op. 16   Comp emit_I   Vectorization 1 2 3 ƒƒ 16 Buffer Local array Step 1 Write to buffer no dependency Step 2 Invoke combiner sequentially Fig 2 A vectroization friendly algorithm without write con”ict by using a buffer for the map phase We develop a new vectorization friendly algorithm to address the write con”ict issue Instead of performing the combiner for each intermediate pair generated by emit intermediate immediately we buffer a number of pairs Writing to the buffer is independent for each map operation When the buffer is full we call the combiner for those pairs sequentially Figure 2 demonstrates this vectorization friendly map If there is no buffer there will be write con”icts on the local array which occurs in the dark element of local array Our proposed approach avoids the write con”icts since each map operation writes to the buffer independently and the combiners are invoked sequentially This way autovectorization by the compiler is possible The decision on whether to use the vectorization friendly map depends on the ability of the map operation to be vectorized by the compiler Users are suggested to adopt this technique if the map operations can be successfully vectorized based on the printout message from the Intel compiler about vectorization eligibility C SIMD Parallelism for Hash Computation Hash computation is a key component in the MapReduce framework We observe that the auto-vectorization often fails due to the complex logic for hash computation Thus we choose to manually implement the hash computation using SIMD instructions SIMD hash computation for native data types is straightforward The same procedure is applied to different input elements which fully employs the SIMD feature However it is challenging to process variable-sized data types such as text strings Overall various hash functions for strings such as FNV  and djb2  ha v e the similar w ork”o w  which processes characters one by one As a result the workload of the hash computation for a given string depends on its length 127 


The challenge is how to ef“ciently handle strings with variable lengths Furthermore SIMD instructions only can be applied to VPU vector registers How to pack data from memory to the vectors ef“ciently is another challenging problem We propose two SIMD hash computation algorithms which are named as SIMDH-Padding and SIMDH-Stream  1 SIMDH-Padding It contains multiple rounds and each round processes characters from 16 consecutive strings in parallel The intuition is within each round we treat 16 strings as equal-length strings with the length L r  L r is equal to the number of characters in the longest string among these 16 strings Then if a string is shorter than L r  we pad this string with empty characters SIMDH-Padding has low control overhead due to its simplicity It takes full advantage of SIMD instructions for computation and data packing However it underutilizes the computation resource due to the padding of empty characters 2 SIMDH-Stream This algorithm continuously feeds the SIMD units with strings Input strings are treated as a stream As long as a SIMD unit becomes available the next entire string is fed to that unit for processing Compared with SIMDH-Padding SIMDH-Stream introduces more complex control ow for data packing It checks characters in the vector one by one for each iteration If a character is zero then it loads the rst character of the next unprocessed string to the vector There is no direct SIMD instructions for this process However SIMDH-Stream does not waste computing resources on empty characters We evaluate both SIMDH-Padding and SIMDH-Stream in Section IV-A D Pipelined Execution for Map and Reduce Phases We propose to pipeline map and reduce phases on the Xeon Phi based on the MIMD hyper-threading execution The motivation is that the map function de“ned by users usually performs heavy computation But the reduce phase contains many memory accesses in which the major work is to construct the global container We pipeline the computationintensive map and memory-intensive reduce to improve the overall hardware resource utilization For the array container implementation the pipeline stage is not balanced as the reduce phase is too short Thus this technique is more effective for hash table container implementation than array container implementation The pipelined map and reduce are implemented using a producer-consumer model The map and reduce workers are the producers and consumers respectively A key improvement is to make the local hash table work on a pre-allocated small buffer with a smaller size than the L2 cache This is to improve the data locality of local hash table building If the nal global hash table is very small e.g smaller than the L2 cache the non-pipelined model will be more ef“cient This is because the reduce phase will be too short to take advantage of pipelining because of the small hash table On the other hand the pipelined model introduces storage overhead Our producer-consumer model is adaptive to the pipelined and non-pipelined models Recall that we allocate a x-sized buffer smaller than the L2 cache for the local hash table If the nal hash table is smaller than this buffer no data will be fed to the reduce worker the consumer until the map phase is nished This way our pipelined model essentially degrades to a nonpipelined model as we expected E Eliminating Local Arrays In Phoenix each worker maintains a local container in the map phase This design is ef“cient when the container size is small However it will introduce performance issues when the container becomes large An alternative is to eliminate local containers and directly update the global container when the container size is large This technique is applied to the array container only since it can be implemented using supported atomic data types There are two major advantages Thread scalability Due to the relatively small memory size on the Xeon Phi 8 GB the thread scalability can be limited when using local arrays As an extreme example of using Bloom lter in bioinformatics e v aluated in Section IV if the whole human genome is used the local array size is around 3.7 GB In such a case only two threads can be used on the Xeon Phi employing local arrays Cache ef“ciency When the array becomes large random memory accesses on arrays cause poor data locality Using the global array is able to improve the cache ef“ciency because of the ring interconnection Speci“cally when the local arrays are eliminated the large global array is likely distributed across L2 caches of different cores When a cache miss occurs on one core the data may be copied from another cores L2 cache to avoid the expensive memory access On the contrary using local arrays cannot bene“t from this hardware feature Because a local array is only stored in a speci“c cores L2 cache but not shared across different L2 caches The decision on whether to eliminate local arrays is automatically decided by our framework to maximize cache ef“ciency If the size of each local array is smaller than the L2 cache then we keep these small local arrays as Phoenix does Otherwise our framework will eliminate the local arrays

techniques used for each application have been summarized in Table I Note that for a speci“c benchmark application our framework is able to analyse the MapReduce code and apply accordingly the combination of optimization techniques This is straightforward to applying for other big data applications We used dash lines for Histogram and Bloom Filter as the largest numbers of threads for them are less than 60 For Monte Carlo and Black Scholes which take advantage of vectorization in MRPhi they are up to 2.7X and 4.6X faster than their counterparts in Phoenix For Word Count and Reverse Index that are based on the hash table MRPhi can achieve a speedup of up to 1.2X Furthermore by eliminating local arrays MRPhi is able to achieve a speedup of up to 38X and 18X for Histogram and Bloom Filter respectively In summary MRPhi can achieve a speedup of 1.2X to 38X over Phoenix for various applications on the Xeon Phi V C ONCLUSION In this paper we present MRPhi which is the rst MapReduce framework optimized for the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor In MRPhi in order to take advantage of VPUs we develop a vectorization friendly technique for the map phase and SIMD hash computation We also pipeline the map and reduce phases to better utilize the hardware resource Furthermore we eliminate local arrays to improve the thread scalability and data locality Our framework is able to identify suitable techniques for a given application automatically Our experimental results show that MRPhi can achieve a speedup of 1.2X to 38X over Phoenix for different applications by using our proposed

are given in Figure 8\(b Figures 9\(b and 10\(b again details the execution times of the different parts in the order in which they were executed For  the Rout script executed in only of the total time taken to execute the corresponding PigLatin script while for the Rout script executed within only of the time taken to execute the matching PigLatin script In the wake of thunderstorm Sandy ravaging New York the third script explores W EATHER D ATA for determining historical weather anomalies In our experiment the script determined all days where both the temperature and wind speed were extreme Experiments were executed for both the full GB of data   GB in and GB in  and a smaller dataset of size GB   GB in and GB in  W EATHER D ATA are distributed based on the year of the records Records from years to were in and the rest were in  Execution times are given in the Figure 8\(c Figures 9\(c and 10\(c again show the execution times for the different parts of the execution in the order in which they occurred As in the previous benchmark the data”ow graph of the weather explorer script consisted of a single MapReduce job WeatherMR for both Rout and PigLatin But in our script we used the operator to join temperature and wind speed inputs instead of the operator Because of this for Rout the scripts could be executed while keeping data GD the distribution of the input data based on the year of its recording allowed to be applied For the Rout script executed within only of the time taken to execute the corresponding PigLatin script while for the Rout script executed within of the time of the corresponding PigLatin script VI R ELATED W ORK This section describes work related to Rout and Rrun Apache Cascading is another open-source data”o w engine Cascading consists of a data processing API integration API process planer and process scheduler Like Pig Cascading operates on top of Hadoop in a single datacenter FlumeJava is a statically typed data processing language proposed by Google It is implemented as a Java library A data”ow graph making use of MapReduce jobs for parallelization is generated from a FlumeJava program PQL is another extension of Java recently proposed by Reichenbach et al PQL is a logic-based declarati v e language which facilitates the expression of parallel elements of a computing task with regular Java code being used to deal with the sequential portions The approach supports programmer productivity and allows for aggressive optimizations PQL does not address geo-\ution PLINQ is an e xtension of LINQ 23 for parallel querying of data similar to PQL PLINQ enjoys explicit syntactic support inside NET In contrast to PQL PLINQ is inspired by SQL-style relational queries select statements and is not fully declarative DryadLINQ is an implementation of LINQ for the e x ecution engine None of these languages or their runtime environments currently support setups beyond a single datacenter/cluster Given that all the above-mentioned languages and models revolve around data structures and collections e.g sets maps along with arrays in PQL they are amenable to augmentation with GD data structures Many efforts focus on optimizing data”ow execution instead of dealing with geo-\ution This includes countless optimizations for the MapReduce framework targeting single clusters These are complementary to our work Parcae is a no v el parallel e x ecution en vironment optimized for multiexecutions The solution includes a compiler that creates exible parallel programs a monitor which determines and analyzes resource availability and system performance and an executor which may replace the executing tasks with ones that are better suited for the operating environment Airavat aims at secure analysis of third-party datasets with MapReduce providing strong privacy guarantees in the face of untrusted tasks When combined with a secure inter-datacenter data transfer mechanism solutions such as Airavat can be seamlessly integrated to Rrun to improve the security guarantees of the distributed execution Most commercial databases such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server are designed to handle highly structured data that is available in a single location Many of these databases support multi-region deployments but for high availability and/or fault tolerance Thus they are unsuited for handling GD data Amazon RDS is a cloud-based database solution The back-end of RDS is a relational database deployed in Amazon datacenters RDS supports multi\(availability zone deployments But this is not truly GD since Amazon availability zones are located within a single datacenter Volley is a system for automatically geo-distrib uting data based on the needs of an application presupposing knowledge on the placement of its data client access patterns and locations Based on this information data will be dynamically migrated between datacenters to optimize access times Services like Volley complement a GD data”ow engine but do not replace it Walter is a k e y-v alue storage system that can hold massive amounts of GD data Walter allows transactions and replication of data across

feature named allows Walter to provide strong guarantees while performing replication asynchronously In Walter nodes within a datacenter observe transactions on a consistent snapshot with global ordering while nodes across sites only have to follow causal ordering COPS is another k e y-v alue storage system for GD data COPS is highly scalable and can enforce causal dependencies The main strategy of COPS consists in enforcing causal dependencies between keys before writes are exposed VII C ONCLUSIONS The cloud computing paradigm provides a partial response to data challenges Clouds are however implemented by concrete datacenters whose geographical location matter and no single datacenter can host all the data in the world reliably and ef“ciently The current toolchain has to mature by considering real-life constraints such as geographical distribution or administrative domains This paper has presented Rout a data processing language capable of expressing programs involving datasets from multiple datacenters including individual datasets that are partitioned across datacenters As illustrated by our empirical evaluation even on GD data processing programs compiled to few MapReduce stages Rout is able to reduce the execution time down to half compared to a straightforward schedule which consolidates all data rst At the same time Rout exposes only little geo-distribution to programmers We are currently exploring further copy heuristics and datacenter selection policies than those presented in Section IV the integration of access control for multi-domain setups and the integration our GD model with other data”ow languages R EFERENCES  Y  Y u M Isard D Fetterly  M Budiu U Erlingsson P  K Gunda and J Currey DryadLINQ A System for Generalpurpose Distributed Data-parallel Computing Using a Highlevel Language in
