microelectromechanical systems As a result more and more computability and sophisticated solutions were available at smaller costs concerning power consumption volume mass and commercial prices These effects combined with the adoption of commercial-of-the-shelf COTS microelectronics to space applications were a major breakthrough to the small-satellite eld 1  T h e c o n t i n u o usly growing

University Nanosatellite UYS-1 is considered The employment of low-cost limited hardware to fulll the spacecraft attitude requirements po ses an engineering challenge that is in resonance with the small spacecraft philosophy For the attitude determination part the restrictions and r equirements of the LCADCS resemble most general spacecraft attitude determination problems Thus it nds a great deal of works and documentation in literature 8   9    1 0   T h e choice for an unscented formulation for spacecraft attitud e lter has been evaluated in several works 10   9    1 1   In this context applications of the unscented ltering hav e increased among small-satellites and big space applicatio ns 12  I n t h i s w o r k  t h e U S Q U E  l t e r i s i m p l e m e n t e d w i t h the addition of the angular velocities in the state vector t o improve the control response of the LCADCS Concerning the attitude control part the system should rel y only in magnetic actuation with actuators operating in a relay mode This restrictions compromise the overall control performance and the direct application of usual approaches found in the literature 13   1 4  d o n o t g u a r a n t e e the LCADCS with stability and accuracy required In 15 t h e authors used the same type of relay actuation as the availabl e for the LCADCS However the system also made use of a momentum wheel Nonetheless the steady state actuation still was not adequate to the LCADCS requirements Recently several works have approached the 3-axis magnetic stabilization of spacecrafts using Model Predictive

MPC techniques 16   1 7    1 8   H o w e v e r  t h e c o m p u t a tional burden for the MPC computation and the discretized form of the actuation make these solutions unsuitable for th e LCADCS In this context the paper proposes a control strategy with the goal of stabilizing a 3-axis relay magnetically actuated spacecraft in near polar orbits The paper is organized as follows In Section 2 a general overview of the nanosatellite and its implications to the LCADCS are presented In Section 3 the main concepts concerning the system modeling are discussed Section 4 concerns the attitude determination In Section 5 the attit ude control is considered Section 6 shows the simulated result s for the LCADCS Section 7 concludes the work 2 UYS-1 N ANOSATELLITE The acronym UYS-1 can be directly translated from Russian as First Satellite of the Ukrainian Youth It designates the rst Ukrainian University Nanosatellite being develo ped by different Ukrainian Universities under the leadership o f Dnepropetrovsk National University This is a non-standar d nanosatellite designed in a project developed by Ukrainian universities with wide student participation This projec t is nanced by the Ukrainian government the universities and external sponsors The satellite's launch is supposed to be done for free by a Ukrainian launcher currently under design  however to the best of the author's knowledge no nal decisions have yet been made about the launch The present work was developed in partnership with the University of Brasili a as a result of the recent aerospace cooperation between Braz il and Ukraine Overall Spacecraft Description The UYS-1 ts in the category of nanosatellites designed to weight about 10kg no more than 12kg The nanosatellite body consists of a rectangular shaped mounting with dimensions 150  150  400 mm  Within this structure the spacecraft equipment is allocated trying to achieve near ev en mass distribution and optimize the magnetic balance Outsi de this structure solar panels are attached making an angle wi th the spacecraft body Figure 1 shows a simplistic sketch of th e nanosatellite structure summarizing the above informatio n Figure 1  Representation of the nanosatellite structure body coordinate frame and solar panels identication The spacecraft will be traveling in a sun-synchronous orbit with a revolution period of approximately 99 min  and its Figure 2  Schematic showing the sensors boards and the data ow to the CPU for all the available data for the LCADCS main function is Earth imagery All the spacecraft subsystems are developed around a Central Processing Unit CPU which should handle all the computation concerning the LCADCS algorithms To obtain required navigational data the spacecraft uses a satellite aided navigation board equi pped with a GPS receiver and a sensor board providing the data for the CPU via an USB connection Attitude Determination and Control System The spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control System ADCS will have two distinct subsystems The rst one is a High Precision Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem HPADCS which employs reaction wheels and a star tracker to achieve short time attitude maneuvers and stabilization with high precision less than 0  5 deg in each axis The second one is the LCADCS which uses primarily low-cost and low-power-consuming sensors and actuators to provide time permissible attitude maneuvers and attitud e stabilization with moderate precision The pointing accur acy for the LCADCS is of 3 deg in each axis Each attitude subsystem should operate separately dependi ng on the spacecraft state and given mission operation modes They can also work in conjunction using the magnetic actuation for unloading of the mechanical actuators As the energ y restrictions are severe in the nanosatellite the HPADCS wi ll be used only when strictly needed and most of the spacecraft operation will rely on the LCADCS In the present work only the LCADCS is considered For the LCADCS the determination part can make use of one 3-axis MEM gyros one 3-axis magnetometer and four light transducers The light transducers are xed in the solar pan els making a given angle with the satellite body and together they compose a sun Line-Of-Sight LOS sensor The sensors are connected to a Sensor Board equipped with a microcontroller which is responsible to handle data requisition fro m the CPU In Figure 2 a schematic view of the LCADCS determination hardware is presented The attitude control part of the LCADCS should rely only on magnetic actuation using three magnetorquers aligned with the principal axes of inertia of the body More than that the actuators should operate in a relay mode Eight bits connect the CPU to the actuation board responsible for the magnetic actuation Every 2 bits handle the actuation of one of the three magnetorquers The unused pair of bits 2

The component   k is related to the bias estimates and   k is related to the angular velocity estimation The sigma points  p k are converted to their quaternion counterpart and the attitude deviations are applied to the curre nt quaternion estimate in order to assemble a set of scattered quaternion attitudes In the prediction step of the lter t hese attitudes are propagated using a discretized model of 7 q  k 1  n     k  q  k n     k    cos  0  5 k    k k  t  I 3 x 3  h     k i    k     k cos  0  5 k    k k  t      k  sin  0  5 k    k k  t     k k    k k  15 This discretization presented in 8  i s n e c e s s a r y d u e t o t he constrained nature of the quaternions The propagation of the   k sigma points is done using a rst order discretized approximation of 6    k 1  J  1  t  T k  h     k i J    k      k  16 where T k is the applied torque at instant k  and  t is the elapsed time The bias propagation is assumed an identity    k 1     k  17 A vector observation in the body frame can be described as v b  DCM  q  v i   18 where v b is the measured vector in body frame v i is the vector in inertial frame and  is a random noise The correction model is slightly different from that

interesting problem and has been subject of research of many previous works 31   3 2   33  T h e m a g n e t i c a t t i t u d e c o n t r o l p o s e s a s e v e r e r e s t r i c t ion intrinsic to the actuation principle Any induction genera ted by the magnetic actuators will interact with the geomagneti c local eld to produce an actuation torque T   M   B  20 where M is the magnetic induction generated by the magnetorquers and B denotes the geomagnetic eld The spacecraft experiences local uncontrollability around the dire ction of the Earths magnetic eld However the direction of the geomagnetic eld has almost periodic variation with respec t to a given inertial frame once the spacecraft changes its position along the orbit It can be shown that the mean controllability can be achieved for orbits with high inclin ation 13  One of the most common approaches to the 3-axis stabilization of a magnetically actuated spacecraft consists in the denition of a desired torque actuation  T des  and posterior denition of a optimal magnetic induction that best approximates the desired torque 31   1 3    3 4    1 4   I n o r d e r t o optimize energy savings the desired magnetic induction ca n be obtained from a simple geometric analysis as M des   B   T des k B k 2  21 This approach sometimes referred to as torque projection approach is one of the most common in literature In 13 t h e authors propose a control law to determine T des resembling a PD-like controller PD-like controllers have long been sho wn to solve the attitude control problem when a unrestricted actuation is available 35  I t i s n o t e w o r t h y t h a t t h e c o n t r ol gain matrices in 13 a r e s u b j e c t t o v e r y l o w s c a l i n g f a c t o r s  which are crucial to the system stability Even using differ ent approaches to obtain T des  this design direction is observed In 14  t h e a u t h o r u s e s a m o d i  e d s l i d i n g m o d e a p p r o a c h f o r the control law and it is cited that an increase in the gains improving the spacecraft response would eventually break the stability In fact as pointed out in 31  i f t h e c l o s e d loop spacecraft dynamics are sufciently slow the time-varyin g system which experiences local uncontrollability can be approximately studied in terms of its time-invariant appro ximations which have mean controllability This empirica l rule for attaining stability is directly related to the phys ics underlying the problem Observing the slow actuation guideline presented in 31  the stabilizing desired torque  T des  in steady-state is expected to be several times smaller than the ones available to approximate it with the relay actuation of the LCADCS depending on the saturation of the relay actuators In thi s sense the use of relay-type actuators can make it hard to attain stability in steady-state using the torque projecti on approach In simulation it only was possible to stabilize t he nanosatellite with relay-type actuation when the maximum magnetic actuation was limited to 0  01 Am 2  The results for these simulations are given in the next section Even though the use of a magnetorquer saturation at 0  01 Am 2 could stabilize the nanosatellite the time for stabilizat ion was exaggeratedly large about 9 orbits and the steady-state actuation was prohibitive in terms of energy when compared to usual continuous actuation proles due to the extensive chattering of the magnetorquers It should be noted that it can be found previous cases in 6 


the literature using the above approach In 15 t h e a u t h o r uses the same type of discontinuous relay actuation as in the LCADCS However the system disposed of a momentum wheel Nonetheless the steady state actuation still was no t adequate to the LCADCS requirements To the best of the authors knowledge there are no solutions in the literature for 3-axis magnetic stabilization with the use of relay-typ e actuation with magnetorquers such that could be directly applied to the LCADCS development Therefore it was necessary to work out a solution to that project obstacle in the LCADCS Recently several works have approached the 3-axis magneti c stabilization of spacecrafts using Model Predictive Contr ol MPC techniques 16   1 7    1 8   I n p r i n c i p l e  i f  f u t u r e  information would be available the LCADCS could decide the best instantaneous actuation in order to gain overall stability However the computational burden for the MPC computation and the discontinuous form of the actuation make these solutions unsuitable for the LCADCS The relay actuated magnetorquers can assume 27 congurations by switching their polarity see Table 1 Due to the reduced number of possible actuations it is reasonable to consider a one step ahead prediction before the control acti on decision Thus it would be possible to decide among the 27 possible actuations for the one that has the most desirabl e local instantaneous effects Even though the problem stil ls in how to dene the desired local instantaneous effects on th e system to gain overall stability In this direction the control strategy rst calculates the predictions using 16 and 15 q k 1  u   n   k  q k  22  k 1  u   J  1  t  T k  u       J  k    k  23 with u  1      27 corresponding to the 27 possible actuations Then the variable   corresponding to an error vector is dened as  k  C p q err k  C d  err k  q err k     q ref  1  q ref  1  q k   err k   k   ref k  24 where C p and C d as constant gain matrices to be tunned q ref is the pointing reference  ref is the angular velocity reference and the inverse quaternion is dened as q  1     q q 4   25 Now an error variable  k 1  u  can be predicted for each possible actuation This permits the denition of a rst err or measure given simply by the euclidean norm of   This error measure is related to the distance from the actual system conguration from the solution surface   0  n k  k  k k  26 Rigorously at each instant in time only the dynamics perpendicular to the geomagnetic eld can be reduced from the system If the actuation is dened seeking for the maximum decrease from  n k to  n k 1  this could leave uncontrollable dynamics in the system that degrade the pointing accuracy Depending on the actuation power and the orbit period this could cause instability This is the equivalent to the empir ical rule pointed in 31 i n w h i c h t h e s y s t e m s h o u l d c o n v e r g e restricted to slow dynamics Thus it is necessary to dene a way to restrict the actuation over the error variable  k to maintain the stability To do so a second error measure was dened in terms of the error projection in the local geomagnetic eld B   k   k  B k k B k k  27 The effect of the actuations over this second error measure can be predicted assuming that the geomagnetic eld of the Earth is approximately constant in an inertial coordina te system for the control time window  1 sec  as   k 1   k 1  B k 1 k B k 1 k  B k 1  DCM  q k 1  DCM  q k  T B k  28 By deciding the actuation observing the predictions for the two measures    and  n  it is possible to reduce the local error through kinematic movements trying to maintain the controllability over the remaining error The u th actuation is selected from the set of possible actuations as min u   k 1  u     k  n k 1  u    n k   n k 1  u  29 If no actuations respect the restriction the system uses null actuation by default This approach allows the choice for more powerful actuators with maximum induction of 0  1 Am 2  The evaluation of the proposed system is addressed in the next section 6 S IMULATIONS A rst simulation for the determination system was done for the spacecraft in stationary position and considering the s un always visible when not in eclipse The results are shown in Figure 5 for the x axis of the spacecraft It can be seen that the effect of the varying magnetic eld is reected in a wave form of the 3  uncertainty The more one given axis has magnetic components in it the bigger is the signal-noise ratio So t he valleys occur when large amounts of the magnetic eld are in 7 


a given axis and the peaks in the uncertainty occur when the module felt by the axis is null The use of relay-type actuators to approximate a continuous desired torque T des  as discussed in Section 5 was evaluated in several simulations The stabilization was attained onl y when the maximum induction in the magnetorquers was limited to 0  01 Am 2  Figures 6 and 7 show simulation results for the stabilization at the origin with the nanosatellite s tarting with 2 deg s angular velocity error and 90 deg pointing error in the y axis Due to the small saturation limits in the relay magnetorquers the time for stabilization is exaggeratedl y large as is clear in Figure 6 The steady-state response and actuation prole is detailed in Figure 7 showing the energy problems cited in Section 5 The one step ahead predictive approach for the control strat egy proposed in Section 5 was evaluated with the same initial conditions used in the simulation illustrated in Fi gures 6 ans 7 The simulation results are shown in Figures 8 and 9 In Figure 8 a considerable increase in the performance is observed The time for stabilization droped to around 4 orbits given the availability of more powerful relay actuators Interestingly enough this control strategy conf ers mean stability to the system accounting only with one step ahead predictions In Figure 9 the steady state response and actuation prole are presented Despite the fact that the actuation is bigger  0  1 Am 2  than the one used with the torque projection strategy  0  01 Am 2  Figures 9 and 7 show that the proposed strategy has a better steady-state prole concerning energy costs and maximum errors To roughly evaluate the effects of residual magnetic dipole s on the system small magnetic dipoles based on data from other nanosatellites 26 w e r e a p p l i e d e q u a l l y d i s t r i b u t e d in the 3 axes A steady-state simulated result is shown in Figure 10 In this simulation the errors remained lower than 6 deg in each axis which is an usual pointing precision for most low-cost attitude determination and control systems A more detailed evaluation of the proposed strategy with more trustworthy magnetic data will be done in future works Finally a simulation was performed combining the determination and control parts of the LCADCS to evaluate the proposed control behavior in the presence of velocity and point ing uncertainties from the LCADCS determination part The initial conditions were the same of the previous simulation s The system stood within 3 deg in each axis during the steadystate and the transient phase was unaffected by the uncertainties The simulation results are shown in Figures 11 and 12 The orientation error estimated angular error surrou nded by the 3  condence interval from the estimation and the 3 deg tolerance for each axis is depicted in Figure 11 Figure 12 shows the convergence of the overall LCADCS system and the actuation prole for each magnetorquer Comparing Figures 9 and 12 it is clear that the actuation prole is more active when the uncertainties are present 7 C ONCLUSION The design and simulation for the LCADCS is presented The proposed attitude determination part of the system was capable of delivering attitude and angular velocities esti mates so that the control stability of the system was not compromised For simplicity in this work only the bias of the gyros were considered in the lter but other parameters coming from gyros or magnetometers could be as well added to the state vector In the control part of the LCADCS a control strategy was developed to maintain the stability with 3 deg pointing accuracy considering the actuation restriction s attitude determination characteristics and orbit prole of t he nanosatellite The simulation results show that the system stabilization is attained The proposed controller showed to promote energy savings and better results when compared to approaches using the direct approximation of continuous controllers by relay actuation A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank the Brazilian National Council for Scientic and Technological Development CNPq the Dnepropetrovsk National University

  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar.

To achieve high SNR in low light conditions a 4.08s exposure \(or stare time is used. For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two. The resulting E/W scan rate is 2400 km per observing hour and facilitates mapping of  the gases CO 2 CH 4 and CO with 2.7 km sample spacing on continental size regions several times per day The optical design code, using actual tolerances as have been achieved in previous LM ATC space instrument builds predicts spatial resolutions per sample of 4.1 km NS and 5.4 km EW Per 4.08s stare time twelve consecutive spectral images or frames, with 340 ms integration times are acquired and coadded per pixel to a 1024  x 1024 buffer array. The coadded buffer comprises the spectral image that is reported to telemetry.  Correlated double sampling \(CDS\used per each of the 12 frames. In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively. This measurement set is capable of providing break through reduction of uncertainty and attribution for the sources of CO 2 CH 4 and CO within the large geostationary field of regard of the geoCARB References 1  J.
