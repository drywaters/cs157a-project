Abstract False data injection is a big threat to sensor networks. A traceback mechanism based on probabilistic packet marking is proposed in this paper. The performance of the basic marking method is thoroughly studied. There is a defect in the basic marking method that upstream nodes\222 marks are collected by the sink with low probability. To solve the problem, two different improved marking methods-EPPM&EPNM-are proposed Every node\222s marking is collected by the sink with approximately equal probability in EPPM. The sink can locate every node by collecting packets of approximately equal number in EPNM Keywords-Sensor networks, Security, Probabilistic packet marking, Traceback analysis 
 I  INTRODUCTION  Wireless sensor networks\(WSNs\ offer new opportunities to directly interact with the physical environment in both civilian and military contexts. Such environments may have adverse conditions \(e.g., in a chemical plant\ or can be quite hostile \(e.g., in a battlefield\[1  S e n s o r  n o d e s c a n b e  compromised and all the information stored in them is obtained by adversaries. Adversaries can launch various attacks using these compromised nodes. One important form of these attacks is false data injection[2, 3  C o mp r o mis e d  nodes can inject a lot of forged packets to the network in order to exhaust network resources \(e.g., energy, bandwidth 
storage space A number of solutions[2,3,4 h a ve b e e n pr op os e d t o c op e  with false data injection, however, most of them adopt an enroute filtering mechanism[2  an d can o n l y p a s s i v el y m i t i g a t e  the damages caused by attacks. In this paper, we present a practical model for traceback based on probabilistic packet marking in sensor networks, and analyze the performance of marking method in this model. What\222s more, we improve the basic marking method in different ways The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the background information. Some models are presented in section III. In section IV, we analyze the marking   method  described in  section III.     Two    different

At last, we conclude the paper in section VII  II  BACKGROUND  IP traceback has been proposed for achieving traceback of DDoS[5 a t ta ck s in  th e in t e r n et Th e r e ar e t w o m a in k i n d s  o f  IP traceback techniques: probabilistic packet marking\(PPM\[6  and packet loggin   In PPM, each router inscribes its identification information onto the arriving packets with a certain probability so that the 
victim can reconstruct the whole attack path by collecting enough packets. But it is assumed that the compromised nodes cannot launch colluding attacks[6 an d r o u t e r s  ar e w el l  protected[8   E v en i f o n l y t w o n o d es  w h i ch  ar e co m p r o m i s ed  launch a colluding attack, the PPM method in the internet is ineffective In packet logging, each router logs packets that it forwards In order to save the required storage space, routers record packet digests, instead of the packets themselves, in a spaceefficient data structure like Bloom filter[9  D u r i n g  t h e traceback process, routers query their neighbors iteratively using attack packets. This approach can track a single IP 
packet, but the computation and storage of the packet digests are prohibitive for sensor nodes A trackback scheme based on probabilistic packet marking is proposed in ref. [10 A t  t h e s a me  ti me  it u s e s v a r i o u s  space in packet header. So it is not a practical model for traceback in WSNs Thus it can be seen from the above that existing internet traceback mechanisms cannot be adopted in WSNs directly therefore, the analysis of effectiveness of PPM for IP traceback in the internet[11, 12 can n o t a p p l y t o WS N s ei th e r   and there is not a performance analysis on PPM for traceback in WSNs  III  Models  A  Network Model 
Each node V i has a unique ID i. Node V i is also called node i in the following sections. Let node i be the ith node that receives the packet \(including the node that generates the packet\, and j denote the number of hops between the node and the sink. Each node i shares two hash functions\(h i h i 222  with the sink. It uses h i to encrypt its ID, and h i 222 to generate 682

  Figure 1.The basic marking method   MACs for arriving packets. The reason to do so is to make the mechanism secure enough. A similar and detailed model is presented in ref. [1   B  PPM Model All the intermediate forwarding nodes will mark the arriving packet with probability  p, and a packet can be marked by m  nodes at most. Fig. 1 shows the basic marking method when m=2. When a node determines to mark the packet, it checks that how many nodes have marked the packet. If there are less than m marks, it will mark the packet from the first empty field; otherwise, it will cover the first mark with its own mark and clear the following marks. Every packet that has been marked records partial path information therefore, the sink can traceback to the source by collecting enough packets. Obviously, there is a defect in the marking method that all nodes mark the packet with the same probability, so upstream nodes\222 marks can be collected by the sink with low probability. We call this method the Basic Probabilistic Packet Marking \(BPPM  C  Traceback Model There are two tables in the sink-one is \(i, h i i\, the other is i, h i 222 There are two sets in the sink-one is S, the other is T. S is the set of all possible located nodes; T is the set of all nodes marking packets. If false data injection attacks occur, the sink checks all the marks in the packet header when receiving a packet. The sink records all nodes which are verified, and then it inserts nodes to S and T or deletes nodes from S. If there is only one node in S during a reasonable period of time the sink locates the source node. We show the process in Algorithm 1 for the case where m=2 We can prove that our models can defend against all forms of false data injection attacks, but the proof is omitted because of the space constraints  IV  ANALYSIS on BPPM    In this section, we analyze the performance of the basic marking method. It is assumed that a packet can be marked by m nodes at most. Let n denote the path length \(The sink is not included\nd 683 001 4  There are two following situations in which node i s marking information can be collected by the sink 1  Node i marks the arriving packet, and there doesn t exist any downstream node marking the packet.

Let n denote the path length \(The sink is not included\, and a packet can be marked by two nodes at most The probability that node i marks the arriving packet and the marking information is collected by the sink is as follows  2    2 1  1   1     1   2  1 2 This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE CCNC 2\008 proceedings 001 i m\ denote the probability that node i\222s   __________________________________________________  Algorithm 1 Algorithm for traceback___________________  Initialization S= \330, T= \330 Traceback When the sink receives a packet with no mark does nothing When the sink receives a packet with 1 valid mark if the packet\222s first two fields are marked by node s if s 002 T S=S 003 s T=T 003 s if the packet\222s last two fields are marked by node t if t 002 T T=T 003 t if t 004 S S=S-{t When the sink receives a packet with 2 valid marks from nodes s&t if s 002 T S=S 003 s T=T 003 s if t 002 T T=T 003 t if t 004 S S=S- {t ______________________________________________________________  marking information is collected by  the sink. We derive the probability 001 i m  as follows It is trivial to get 001 i m\ for cases where m=1 and m=n.

For the sake of convenience, we only compute 001 i m\ for nodes satisfying the condition that i n-m There is not a unified expression for nodes satisfying the condition that i>n-m, but it is not hard to get 001 i m\or those nodes   Definition 1 212  212  212 212  005 006 006 001  The proof is omitted because of space constraints Let n=20, np=m, and we consider the first node.

Equal Probability Packet Marking Method There is not much space in the packet header for PPM, so we consider the basic and practical case where m=2. Let j be the distance between the node and the sink, and  probability that the node which is j hops from the sink marks the arriving packet and the marking information is collected by the sink. Let P j be a function of j and p, where p denotes the probability that the last node marks the arriving packet The goal of the improved marking method is to make and p as equal as possible for every j. We call this method Equal Probability Packet Marking \(EPPM  This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE CCNC 2\008 proceedings 005   Definition 2  u i n u u i n u p p C 212 212  212 212 212   212 212  m k i w k wm i k wm k wm i m p p C k   1  0 1 1  1    212 212 212 212  212 212  i i n i p p i n p B 6  Base on  \(4\and \(6\ , we get \(3\ Thus, we prove the theorem   The average number of marks that a packet carries is np Fig. 2 illustrates theorem 1 for cases where n=10, 20, 40 and np=2 Using the method as in theorem 1, we get

Let p=0.06 and we get P j through several experiments and evaluations. As shown in Table I, P j increases with j and is approximately equal to p B  Equal Packet Number Marking Method We have presented EPPM to improve the basic marking method, but it has a disadvantage that the number of packets needed to locate the compromised node increases with the path length. So we present a method called Equal Packet Number Marking \(EPNM\. Using EPNM, no matter which node is launching a false data injection attack, the sink can locate it by collecting packets of approximately equal number There isn\222t a general method to calculate P j in EPNM either Considering the same situation as in above subsection, we get P j in EPNM as shown in Table I. We can see from Table I that P j in EPNM increases more quickly than in EPPM. More evaluations will be presented in next section  VI.   SIMULATION EVALUATION  We run simulations to verify our previous analysis and evaluate the performance of each marking method. We consider a typical sensor network situation that a node is at max 20 hops from the sink. The sink uses Algorithm 1 to locate compromised nodes Fig. 4 shows the number of runs that the sink cannot successfully locate the source when 400 packets are received Apparently, BPPM works well when the attack path is Figure 4. How many runs fail to locate the source in 100 runs with 400 packets. The distance between the source and the sink changes from 2 to 20 hops    Figure 5. How many runs fail to locate the source in 100 runs with 600 packets. The distance between the source and the sink changes from 2 to 20 hops  short \(<10\,   but the probability of failure increases quickly with the attack path. EPPM performs better than BPPM when the attack path is relatively long. Fig. 5 shows the situation when 600 packets are received. It can be seen that when 600 packets are received, the sink can successfully locate the source with high probability \(approximate 90%\ using EPNM no matter which node is launching a false data injection attack  It can be seen from the above that EPPM and EPNM perform better than BPPM when the attack path is long EPNM is more efficient when the coverage of the sensor network is large. In EPNM, no matter which node is compromised, it cannot cause fatal damage to the network  685 This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE CCNC 2\008 proceedings

In this section, MRTP is discussed The Multi-flow Real-time Transport Protocol for ad hoc networks   MRTP i s  a  t ra n s po rt  p r o t o c o l  a n d i s  de s i gn e d  to allow applications to send real-time data over ad hoc networks. It uses an MDC encoder to split a stream of data into several flows then sends each flow on a separate path The MRTP protocol is a session-oriented protocol This means a session needs to be established prior to any data transmission A three-way handshaking is initiated from the source node sender/receiver using HelloSession  and ACKHelloSession  messages This gives both parties an opportunity to agree on some parameters such as number of flows to be used During the session, some flows may be unavailable, due to node failure or severe congestion In this case the receiver sends a DeleteFlow message to the sender. The sender in return deletes the affected flow and redistributes the assigned remaining packets to other active flows When a new path is found the routing protocol informs MRTP about this new path Accordingly a new flow can be added to the session by initiating an AddFlow message. MRTP generates periodic QoS reports using Sender Reports and Receiver Reports that carry both per-flow and per-session statistics When packets of different flows arrive at the destination the receiver stores these packets in a buffer for reordering \(according to sequence number and timestamp in header AdamRTP looks similar to the MRTP However MRTP is designed for ad hoc networks, not WSNs, and a WSN has extra new requirements that any new protocol should consider Furthermore MRTP is a session-oriented protocol but we believe in multimedia streaming this is not necessary Finally MRTP does not consider power consumption at all V. CONCLUSION Real-time multimedia applications are resource hungry They require more computational and storage capabilities than traditional network applications In addition they need more bandwidth for transmission Running this type of applications over WSNs which suffer from computational memory and power constrains is challenging Our goal is to send real-time multimedia over WSNs while achieving good QoS and extending the lifetime of the network WSNs are usually densely deployed This creates many paths between any two sensors. We can utilize this feature and divide a large multimedia file into smaller portions then send each small portion over a separate path i.e instead of transferring the multimedia stream using few nodes many intermediate nodes are involved We propose the Adaptive Multi-flows Real-time Multimedia Transport Protocol for WSNs AdamRTP which divides one multimedia stream into multiple flows then sends each flow over a separate path if possible to the destination Compared to a single-flow scenario each intermediate node in the multi-flows scenario sends fewer packets thus saving more power per node In addition AdamRTP employs some adaptation techniques that act like congestion control We assume that each sensor has a fair size of internal cache In the future we hope that WSNs with multimedia capabilities a r e  w i de l y  de pl oy e d   Our simulation results show that AdamRTP enhances the delivery especially when the WSN is suffering from congestion due to node failure or external source of traffic Also, it is able to reduce the power consumption per node and deliver more packets if the nodes have limited power source thus extending the lifetime of the WSN REFERENCES 1 G o y a l   V   K   2 0 0 1   M u l t i p l e  D e s c ri p t i o n  C o d i n g   C o m p r e s s i o n  M e e t s  t h e  Network.

In-water tests have demonstrated the viability of the MARTA architecture as instan tiated in TAOSF One of our key next steps is an extended end-to-end test in which multiple OASIS platforms map a rhodamine-dye HAB surrogate under human telesupervision. Over the next year we plan to increase the number of platforms, develop and deploy adaptive sensing algorithms, and continue deploying the TAOSF system in the Chesapeake Bay estuary Because of their in-situ observation capabilities and resolution, as well as their adaptivity, telesupervised autonomous surface vehicles are crucial to the sensor web for Earth science. The MARTA telesupervision architecture underlying TAOSF is broadly applicable to a wide variety of domains beyond HABs, incl uding ecological forecasting water management, carbon management, disaster management, coastal management, homeland security, and planetary exploration A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work was supported by NASA award NNX06AF27G Telesupervised Adaptive Ocean Sensor Fleet”, granted under the Advanced Information Systems Technology program of NASA’s Earth Systems Technology Office ESTO\he TAOSF project is a collaboration among Carnegie Mellon University CMU Flight Center \(GSFC\, NASA Goddard’s Wallops Flight Facility \(WFF\mergent Space Technologies, Inc. \(EST and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL\ifornia Institute of Technology.

The second state describes the need to impose any operational restrictions which are mandated by procedures or by pilot decision Hence No means no operational restrictions while a Yes means that some operational restrictions are necessary Finally the third state describes whether some emergency or abnormal operation is applied which is mandated by procedures or by pilot decision Here Yes means that emergency or abnormal operation must be applied while No means that an emergency or abnormal procedure is not necessary Both criteria are related to the failure and function characteristics which are given as input to the ETA One presumption is that only failure effects with possible operational or economic consequences according to MSG-3 should be included in the analysis The failure characteristics also include the rate of occurrence which will affect the outcome of the analysis The characteristics of the failure will also advice whether the occurrence of failure will be recognized by the crew or not As standard design practice if the failure has any operational consequences it should be evident to the crew The combination of different events Yes or No within the states of the two criteria operational phase and operating capability will create different scenarios that in turn will determine the ultimate operational consequences Based on the possible combination of events 25 different scenarios were identified which will lead to the following classification of consequences no operational consequence airborne and/or ground delays and emergency or abnormal operation Out of the 25 different scenarios that were identified there are six scenarios with no operational consequences One of these scenarios is when the failure never occurs i.e scenario 25 The other five scenarios where no operational consequences occur are where the failure's associated maintenance is deferrable and there are no necessary operational or abnormal restrictions i.e scenarios 2 6 11 16 and 21 Hence the only difference between these five scenarios is the operational phase where the failure occurs There are 14 event scenarios where the consequences are some sort of delay i.e scenarios 1 3 4 5 8 9 10 13 14 15 18 19 20 and 24 Out of these there are five scenarios where the operational consequences are manifested as only airborne delay i.e scenarios 1 5 10 15 and 20 These scenarios are related to the occurrence of a failure that is related to deferrable items but that requires some operational restrictions Abnormal procedures contribute to operational consequences in scenarios 7 12 17 and 22 All these scenarios are related to failures with non-deferrable items that have some sort of operational restrictions and necessitates emergency and abnormal procedures by the flight crew The main difference between the scenarios is the phase of flight where the failure occurs In scenarios 7 and 12 the failure occurs prior to dispatch or during takeoff respectively The two scenarios 17 failure occurs during cruise and 22 failure occurs during approach and landing result in diversion Also there are situations such as scenario 23 in which the aircraft is in landing mode and the occurrence of a sudden failure in some systems may reduce the capability of the aircraft to complete the landing mission Hence the pilot may perform a touch and go 8 ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED ETA In order to illustrate the proposed ETA and to demonstrate the application of the constructed event tree an Avionic Ventilation System AVS of a hypothetical twin-engine single aisle aircraft has been selected The associated data were gathered from particular airlines and then altered for confidentiality reasons to represent typical scenarios Avionic Ventilation System A VS The AVS is used to cool different avionics equipment AVS comprises different components such as computer blower extract fan sensors filter and valves One of the most important functions of the AVS computer is to control the AVS system's valves to open and close and fans to turn on or off The skin air inlet valve is installed in the fuselage skin to provide an outdoor air supply gateway for AVS on the ground see Figure 5 Figure 5 on the ground the valve is 10 _10 Fan Skin air inlet valve schematic diagram This valve is electrically operated but i Filter Air flow Valve can be manually overridden When the aircraft is 


fully open and in flight the valve is fully closed One of the functional failures which might occur with an AVS system could be defined as Skin Air Inlet Valve fails to close at take-off power setting Taking off with the Skin Air Inlet valve open instead of closed damages the avionics ventilation ducts and may have potential effects on both cabin pressurization and degradation of avionics ventilation performance If the valve is not function properly at take-off power setting prior to take-off a warning message appears on the cockpit display unit so that cockpit crew will be aware of the fault prior to take-off Therefore the conditional probability of detection of failure prior to take-off is 100 see Figure 6 This failure has no catastrophic or safety effect on the aircraft and its occupants However in order to avoid associated effect on cabin pressurization issues and to protect damage to the system the MEL advises that the valve should be closed manually on the ground and the related electrical connection should be isolated This is an immediate action which is required to fly with an inoperative Skin Air Inlet Valve within a certain limited time without any operational restrictions see Figure 6 Therefore the aircraft has to be returned to the ramp/gate so that the maintenance crew can perform these actions before further dispatch Hence this failure is classified as an evident failure with operational effect Based on the proposed ETA the only possible scenario is number 4 which results in the operational consequence Ground delay at departure see Figure 6 In order to quantify the rate at which operational consequences occur the frequency of failure failure rate or intensity should be multiplied by both the conditional probability of occurrence of this failure in different operational phases states 1.1 to 1.5 and the conditional probability of adverse affect of the failure on the operation capability states 2.1 to 2.3 This may be expressed as in Equation 1 The failure rate of Skin air inlet valve fails to close at take-N 1 2 3 4 S inariret vaKefailstD dcs 1 2 1 iec.lity  eah phaseofflight 1.4 Cuse 15 lArcax h  Ii adrg 2 Efedof failueon opering apability 2.1 Ddab 22 23 1 p e U6rng aFerabcn abromni restricicrn prcecdre Ria ID Takedfl 0imb takeoff Yeslow_ 260\260\260 Oocunof failure during 0 ca 0 a 0 Oper.iornl Cancieia m Ar1xmeclde I Nbcperaicnnipat I A rbcrnecblay Grardcalja 4 daeLre I G I_dddajdt"I I Figure 6 Proposed ETA of the hypothetical AVS system K Annual cost of scenario per aircraft Aircraft/year Rate of occurrence of each operational consequence scenario K Rate of occurrencj of scenario per FH Failure rate X Unit cost of ground delay al departure per FH x Conditional probability of states in criteria 1 x Conditional probability of states in criteria 2 t Duration Average annua2 X of delay X utilization X J 0 J 0 FH/yearJ 2 Quantity Per Aircraft QPA 2 11 11 1.2 1.3 


off power setting is 1 12e-5 per Flight Hour FH based on historical data The conditional probability of states in criteria 1 prior to take-off is estimated to 100 as the failure will be evident to the crew prior to take-off The conditional probability of states in criteria 2 nondeferrable with no operational restriction is estimated to 100 as the failure is not deferrable and it does not impose any operational restrictions as the aircraft is not allowed to take-off with the failure present according to the MEL Hence the rate of occurrence of scenario number 4 for AVS is 1.12e 5 per FH X 100 X I100  1.12e 5 per FH The outcome of the ETA on the hypothetical AVS system and the applicable values for each probability which has been gathered from historical data and expert opinions is shown in Figure 6 In order to estimate the cost of associated consequences standard average cost can be used for different operational consequences which normally are provided by the manufacturer or airlines For this specific case i.e scenario number 4 the assumptions made are displayed in Table 1 as advised by experienced practitioners Table 1 Cost Figures of some Type of Operational Consequences Consequences Magnitude Cost Long more than 30 min 70 min Ground delay Short less than 30 min 30 min Long more than 30 min 58 min Airborne delay Short less than 30 min 28 min The annual total cost for each consequence scenario for whole aircraft could be estimated in accordance with Equation 2 Hence the annual cost of scenario number 4 considering 3,000 FH of utilization per year is estimated to 1.12e per FH x 60 min/60 lhr delay time x 70 min x 60 min  420 hr x 3,000 FH year x QPA 1 The proposed methodology could also be adapted as a support for cost-effectiveness analysis of candidate maintenance tasks during the development of aircraft maintenance programs However the analysis documentation also constitutes an important part of the knowledge base which is also useful for design operation and maintenance of the aircraft In order to implement the proposed methodology and achieve valuable results accurate and sufficient data and information are needed as input data for the analysis This information is related to the technical system and its reliability e.g failure modes and their frequency of occurrence and maintainability performances e.g Built-in Test Equipment modularization and Line Replaceable Units Other information that is needed is related to aircraft operation and associated procedures given in formal documents such as the MEL FM FCOM and QRH Also information about the maintenance support performance is necessary The operational consequences and the probabilities of different events included in the proposed event tree can be quantified by the aid of historical data or expert judgments However an exact quantification and assessment of the cost of operational consequences of failures is a challenge due to a long list of influencing factors and inadequacy of required information One example is the challenge to determine a good estimation of the failure rate which requires the collection of data from the world fleet This collection of data is difficult since removal data do not necessarily imply a failure or since subsequent test level has difficulties to duplicate test results achieved at preceding test levels i.e no fault found events Another reason is that even if there is a failure it is not always possible to link the reported failure to the functional failure or failure mode identified in the MSG-3 analysis When there is a lack of historical data expert judgments can be a good source of information To support an effective extraction of the field experts knowledge there are systematic methodologies available e.g pair wise comparison 14.14 aircraft/year 9 DISCUSSION The scenario descriptions using the event trees give a detailed picture of the possible operational consequences of different failures in aircraft system during operation Hence the proposed methodology is considered as a valuable support in the assessment of the operational consequences of failures 12
