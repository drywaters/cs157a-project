Ma 3 tch: Privacy AND Knowledge  Dynamic Networked Collective Intelligence   Udo Kroon, CIO FIU.NET Ministry of Security and Justice The Hague, Netherlands udo.kroon@fiu.net   Abstract This paper introduces a new information technology: ma 3 tch \(autonomous anonymous analysis\. Ma 3 tch enables virtual information integration to build a ëdynamic networked collective intelligenceí without infringing upon security, confidentiality, privacy and/or data protection regulations. It provides organizations with information and knowledge advantages The ma 3 tch technology is empowered by a decentralized information oriented architecture: a ëprivacy by design framework that uses distributed agents to facilitate decentralized but integrated information access, processing and analysis. It shapes a ëvirtual information cloudí between autonomous organizations that enables secure, integral and intelligent real time information analysis. Relevant information and knowledge distributed between autonomous organizations is automatically detected and applied throughout the network as soon as it emerges The dynamic design principles allow practically any type of cross domain\formation to be virtually integrated government, commercial, intelligence, law enforcement, financial telecom, biomedical, compliance, etc., without infringing privacy confidentiality, security or data protection rules and regulations It advances both privacy AND knowledge beyond conventional limitations Keywordsódecentralized information oriented architecture privacy by design strategy; virtual information cloud; dynamic networked collective intelligence; autonomous anonymous analysis I  I NTRODUCTION   For executives and policy makers information technology is like a double edged sword. Collecting, combining and analyzing information offer huge benefits for business and governments. But at the same time when personal data are involved that information easily infringes upon the privacy of citizens. Balancing between privacy and knowledge is a continuous struggle  Centralizing and combining data have many advantages increased knowledge and insight, diagnoses, identification of trends and threats, strategic and competitive advantage, etc But it also leads to severe risks of unlawful access, hacking identity theft, fraud, manipulatio n, exclusion from insurance etc. As the amount of combined information grows, so do the risks and threats. ëIn the 21st Century, bits and bytes can be as threatening as bullets and bom bs,í said Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Lynn III during a speech after a cyberattack at the Pentag  It e m ph a s izes both t h e po w e r and  threat of information and the importance to protect that inform  3    When information is distributed between \(multinational organizations and/or governments many implementation barriers emerge \(business, organization, information and technology\hese barriers significantly limit the information parties are allowed, willing and ab le to combine. Even at a national level it is often impossible to combine and analyze distributed government databases. What about international collaboration where national interests and \(conflicting national legislation come into play  This paper introduces the ma 3 tch technology and the privacy by designí framework used by EU Member State Financial Intelligence Units, that mitigate these barriers. They enable virtual integration and real time analysis of distributed information, knowledge and technology capabilities, without the need for parties to move sensitive information beyond their own premises. Although the technology is designed for intelligence purposes, the dynamic architecture makes it suitable for many other industries and cross domain integration: government, commercial, financial, telecom biomedical, telecom, law enforcement, compliance, etc  II  P ARADOX   P RIVACY A ND K NOWLEDGE   Financial Intelligence Units \(F IUs\tral, national intelligence agencies responsible for receiving, analysing and disseminating disclosures of financial information to the competent authorities \(e.g., law enforcement or prosecutorial authorities\ order to combat money laundering and terrorism financing  978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE 


Depending on the type of FIU and n a t i on al leg i s latio n typically FIUs  receive millions of financial transactions, from thousands of reporting institu tions \(e.g., banks, money or value transfer providers, dealers in high-value goods, casinos etc.\with their own indu stry specific data domain and structures. In addition FIUs have direct or indirect access to dozens of \(heterogeneous\al government, commercial and public information resources \(e.g., criminal investigations convictions, chambers of commerce, bank accounts, etc  In the analysis process FIUs face a paradox: FIUs must exchange ëneed to knowí information with national and international partners to bring relevant information together while guaranteeing strong and effective protection of their privacy and personal data    During this pre-investigative intelligence phase, FIUs can exchange information with each other as long as the information does not leave the FI U premises. Only suspicious information is disseminated to law enforcement and only after prior consent is given by the FIU that disclosed the information. This allows FIUs to cooperate effectively and efficiently without risking FIU intelligence ending up in police systems. Using the same mechanism FIUs can include national government, commercial and public information sources  FIU.NET is a sophisticated decentralized computer system funded by the European Commission since 2004, that enables and enhances the information ac cess, analysis and exchange between EU Member State FIUs. It shapes a virtual information cloud between the FIUs and their \(over 550 distributed government, commercial and public information sources and it enables real time analysis of distributed dynamic information and knowledge otherwise legally organisationally, technically, and/or financially impossible to achieve  FIU.NET is based on 3 core design principles: autonomy decentralization and flexibility Autonomy guarantees information owners full governance over information they connect to the system, and that no other party \(or service provider\as the possibility to gain access to that information without consent of the information owner. It ensures information owners are never forced to comply with externally imposed data standards, rules regulations or limitations. The autonomy principle is crucial to maximize the amount of information that parties are allo wed, willing and able to connect  Decentralisation guarantees autonomous information control and it physically enforces privacy by design  regarding storage, processing, analysis and exchange Information is only physically stored and processed at the premises of the information owner, and is optionally controlled by the owner\tributed where and when access to that information is needed. This means there is no need for remote access \(and  risks\h e information. Decentralization also enhances scalability, speed \(local access\lability and robustness \(there is no central point of failure  Flexibility enables autonomous \(data\ governance. Instead of having to comply with imposed data standards, rules and regulations of a central authority flexibility by design allows each party to integrate their data as is, and on its own terms Data governance \(standards rules, regulations, capabilities can be dynamically adjusted and locally enforced by each information owner. Although enforcing a single standard is much easier, the specific information position of FIUs makes this virtually impossible, unle ss information qua lity, qu antity speed and capabilities are seve rely limited and reduced  The decentralized information oriented architecture Fig. 1 solves this by shaping a virtua l enterprise architecture  It directly connects data owners organisations ithout 3 rd party involvement. Custom data from the back office are virtualized by stores into dynamic structured virtual data elements All distributed\ments can be hierarchically linked and are governed by their information owner using dynamically configurable information resources Resources specify custom business rules \(dynamic data structures, data retention time prior consent, information handling, etc\ for each of the local information sources the FIU ha s access to and negotiate bilateral or multilateral capabilities. This enables both manual  user driven\nd automated agent driven\iterative case building and real time integral analysis of decentralized information and knowledge. Like Lego blocks, the virtual architecture can be dynamically adjusted to the legal organisational information and technology needs of each party  Fig. 1. Decentralized Information Oriented Architecture  The ëprivacy by designí decentralized information oriented architecture builds a virtual information cloud between all parties connected to the network and enables parties to quickly adapt to emerging changes and opportunities. The resulting 


virtual platform bridges and harm onizes legal, organizational informational and technological differences in a complex system of auto n o m o u s l y  g o v e rn ed parties. It e s tab lis h e s a  dynamic information architecture and virtual enterprise architecture without infringing upon local governance privacy, security and confidentiality  In many ways it is the opposite of conventional information architectures and solutions. Instead of enforcing standards standards are dynamic and virtualized. Instead of relational data storage, data are stored hierarchically. Unlike federated databases [8 ere is no rem o te access or \(co s tl y   heterogeneous implementation. Compared to service oriented architectur w h ere inf o rm ation moves between services information remains where it is. Instead, services \(agents\re moved to the information. Compared to conventional analysis where information is first combined and then analyzed information is first analyzed and only relevant information is combined by pushing or pulling information. Unlike cloud solutions, there is complete control where information is stored and processed. Instead of storing and processing information deep ëinsideí boundaries of a service provider   th e in f o r m a tion architect u r e is rever s ed in a sense it is a cloud inside out! The physical \(vertical\ed processes flow of the information oriented architecture consists of 5 \(horizontal\ally integrated layers. Fig. 2 visualizes a generic information flow from an information provider \(A\e or more information consumers \(B, C Fig. 2. Decentralized Information Oriented Architecture Processes  At both parties the information flows through all layers  1 The data access layer connects any kind of data or service.

III  M A 3 TCH P ROCESS A ND P RINCIPLES   Ma 3 tch \(autonomous anonymous analysis\ the generic analysis process to accomplish virtual information integration  the ability to combine information, knowledge and capabilities from multiple distributed organizations without bringing the data physically together. It is based upon the same core privacy by designí principles of the information oriented architecture: autonomy, decentralization and flexibility  Ma 3 tch virtually integrates information and/or knowledge using distributed agents: programs with small and welldefined \(analysis\ tasks that run distributed in the processing layer. Local agents transform information and personal data into anonymized filters that can be \(selectively\ shared: the filters only contain characteristics of the original data, not the actual data itself. At their destination agents re-integrate the characteristics of the anonymous filters with local information resources. Ma 3 tch agents can be used for any kind of local shared or distributed integral an alysis \(operational, strategic social networks, geo-tagging, prediction, correlation, entity extraction, etc  Fig. 3. Ma 3 tch process to accomplish virtual information integration  The virtual integration process \(Fig. 3\ derives knowledge from the local resource \(induction\. The resulting knowledge is used locally or is distribu ted and integrated with remote resources \(deduction\. The ma 3 tch process identifies relevant information and knowledge links between all parties in real time. Even though no sensitive information is exchanged, all organizations can identify where and when other relevant information is available. Each organization increases its information position when it connects new information resulting in a dynamic voluntary and reciprocital 12 13 kno w l e d ge  ne t w o r k  Ma 3 tch achieves cross-organization information and knowledge pu th e ab ilit y to fin d access a n d attract information, knowledge and re sources that are relevant and valuable, even if currently all parties are unaware that the information exists. The process involves 3 steps: autonomous access\mous \(attract\ysis \(achieve  1  Autonomous \(access  Autonomy is guaranteed by the information oriented information architecture, and maximizes the information parties are allowed, willing and able to connect. Each information owner controls what d ata are included in the filter how long the filter is valid, what the precision of the filter is with which parties the filter is shared, and after a hit if, when and what personal data are exchanged. The fact that information is only stored wh en and where access to that information is needed maximizes proportionality and subsidiarity [14:151 bu t also e m po w e rs a v ailab ili t y  by  enabling \(virtual\nformation access   2  Anonymous \(attract  Anonymization is non-trivial. Contrary to encryption anonymization must be irreversib le. Privacy sensitive data is considered anonimized when it cann ot be directly or indirectly connected to an identified or identifiable individual [1   Pseudonimization, for example using hashing values, does not suffice, as it still may be used to identify an individual. But even when all personal data is replaced with random numbers or is completely removed, the remaining data may still be used to link it back to an individual   T o g u a ran tee an onym it y individual dimensions and records are minimized and aggregated in such way that it is impossible to distinguish or link to individual personal records. Only characteristics captured in the anonymous filters are shared with selected parties to ëmagnetizeí and attract relevant information  3  Analysis \(achieve  Analysis integrates received anonymous filters with local information. This provides each organization with unique operational, tactical and strategic knowledge products integrated with their own sensitive information. Local information in each organization is taggedí in real time with the virtual emerging information and knowledge products where other relevant information can be found, trends, threats risks, etc. This analysis process requires flexibility \(agents\ to allow continuous dynamic \(iterative\justment to emerging results and achieve integrated results  The ma 3 tch process virtualizes analysis existing techniques to ma 3 tch: information, knowledge and technology 26 


 IV  M A 3 TCH E XAMPLES   Full technical details of the analysis methods are out of scope, but basic principles and processes are briefly discussed  1  Information Ma 3 tch  Examples of anonymization, aggregation and comparison algorithms that can be used to ma 3 tch distributed information are: fuzzy logic, hash tables, Bl oom filters, transliteration, ngrams, and approximation techniques. The algorithm used in FIU.NET was initially designed for the Intersect project [1   for real time concept extraction and text analysis. It allows fast anonymous distributed cross matching: a million records easily fit in a 1 MB anonymous data structure and can be matched in less than 0.3 milliseconds on a single 3Mhz processor core, making it possi ble to check hundreds of distributed information resources in real time. As simplified example, an information resource contains   Philip Tattaglia \(12/28/16  Luka Brasi \(3/13/26  Johnny Fontane \(10/7/27  The anonymization algorithm minimizes these 3 individual records into a single combined anonymous 4 character fuzzy logic data structure: ëtnUGí. This 4 character code captures the ëcharacteristicsí of the combined original sensitive information, making it impossible to recover the individual records. The extreme data minimization enables \(configurable false positives \(collisions\at further enhance anonymity. In addition, the information owner controls which data are included in filter, and if, when and where filters are shared multiple filters can be created for a single dataset, for example with lower accuracy for sensitive data\. Other parties that receive the filter can use it to ma 3 tch local sensitive data against the anonymized data structure ëtnUGí without knowing the underlying data. The example code ëtnUG allows matching of transliterations, permutations and approximations with 99% accuracy: all following examples match positively with the data structure, even though they use different punctuation marks, date formats, and/or contain spelling errors. Positive hits are optionally or automatically followed up for \(anonymous\alidation, compliance check and/or a fully detailed ëneed to knowí information exchange   Fillip Tataglia \(12/28/16  Tattaglia Philip \(28-12-1916  BRASI, 13-03-1926 \(Luca  Luka Anthonius Braazzi \(3-13-1926  Jonnie FontariÎ \(07-10-1927    19270710\ etc Fig. 4 visualizes the process where organization A generates an autonomous match filter. Only the characters ëtnUGí are exchanged. Organization B locally checks its sensitive information against the anonymous filter ëtnUGí to identify what local information matches with organization A Information links between the organizations are identified in real time as soon as they emerge  Fig. 4. Anonymous information ma 3 tch filter between 2 organizations  2  Knowledge Ma 3 tch  Besides virtual information integration, ma 3 tch technology also allows virtual knowledge integration. Knowledge discovery \(data mining\he process of discovering patterns from large data sets using sta tistics and artificial intelligence Intelligent data analysis can identify, describe and predict trends, threats, profiles, behaviors, etc. Existing data mining techniques can be extremely powerful in combination with the ma 3 tch: it enables global networked knowledge discovery and distribution. An example of a predictive data mining technology is a neural network. Neural networks capture and apply knowledge hidden within data. Like the human brain they learn from experience. The more often a certain combination leads to a specific outcome, the stronger the associations and certainties get \(s implified example in Fig. 5   Fig. 5. neural networks \(simplified\ to capture knowledge  Often neural networks are biased by internal processing logic, data quality and noise of each organization. As a result many predictions are unreliable, and if they are correct they explainí what the organization already implicitly knows \(or thinks it knows Ma 3 tch allows parties to integrate external knowledge with 


their own local information, and identify which data potentially have a higher risk based on that external knowledge. Existing local data are labeled with external knowledge tags. The ability to combine the results of multiple neural networks from multiple or ganizations in real time, leads to far more reliable and useful knowledge products   Fig. 6. Neural network ma 3 tch example between 2 organizations  Ma 3 tch virtually integrates the emerging collective knowledge between organizations. Even better, organizations not only learn and apply what they already implicitly know but they learn and apply the distributed collective knowledge a high risk  transaction is identified \(Fig. 6\se transactions with similar patter ns are identified in 5 other organizations as high risk. This transaction would not have been identified based on local knowledge only. Similarly other data mining technique can ma 3 tch \(e.g., clustering classification, decision trees, n-grams, etc\. Prototyped examples include prediction of the gender or nationality of a person, based on first or last names of a person. All organizations locally train the ma 3 tch using their own local data, and utilize the combined networked intelligence to predictí missing information. There are countless other examples, but the essence is to jointly build, share and utilize common standardized knowledge without the need to disseminate sensitive information  3  Strategic Ma 3 tch  Statistical ma 3 tch analysis enables strategic decision making. Statistics are automatically \(locally\extracted from sensitive information, and virtually integrated to achieve integral knowledge products. Ma 3 tch analysis of money flows identifies hidden distributed fina ncial trends in real time, for example to provide insight in local \(known\versus global unknown\ money flows \(Fig. 7\. It reveals money flows that are locally not available and ot herwise would have remained undetected \(i.e., FI and PL are unaware of the money flows from NL, NL is unaware of the money flow to BG    Fig. 7. Local money flows versus global money flows \(perspective NL  Trends, threats and irregularitie s can be detected as soon as they emerge, and automatically integrated with local data. For decision making this real time global view provides huge strategic advantages to all organizations participating in the ma 3 tch analysis. Combining the results of strategic ma 3 tches with directed neural network ma 3 tches or anonymous ma 3 tches, or even the underlying sensitive data, provides operational and knowledge insight into these strategic results  4  Social Network Ma 3 tch  Social network ma 3 tch enhances social network analysis by creating knowledge about missing entities and links. Social network analysis maps and me asures relationships and flows between people, groups, orga nizations and other connected information or knowledge entities. Common measures that provide insight into the various roles and groupings in a social network include: degree \(number of direct connections betweenness \(number of indirect connections\, closeness distance to entities in netw ork\ and bridges \(connecting different networks\ But a single piece of missing information severely impacts these measures. Virtual integration combining the information-, knowledge- and strategic ma 3 tch\, identifies new and/or similar entities, links and relations between \(otherwise disconnected\etworks \(Fig. 8  Fig. 8. Example where ma 3 tch completes ëloose ends  It allows parties to identify information links with other information \(distribu ted across databases to determine which role that information has in the ëglobalí network. Parties can even identify that two or more en tities that locally seem to be disconnected, are actually related to each other based on information available at the other party \(missing links 


5  Technology Ma 3 tch  Ma 3 tch minimizes financial, legal, organizational, technical and informational implementation barriers, and maximizes the information and knowledge position of all parties connected to the virtual cloud. As connected parties share a common virtual enterprise architecture \(and vi rtual information architecture they can jointly develop or acquire new \(commercial information sources and services cost effectively, and seamlessly integrate these with their internal systems and databases supporting privacy, security or confidentiality. It reduces individual costs and further enhances and harmonizes their capabilities. It enables connected parties to act and operate as a single virtual enterprise  This enhances the local technology capabilities of the parties involved, and enables access to information and technologies otherwise too difficult or too costly to achieve Examples are \(anonymous\tegration with commercial\ases, but also with generic services like entity-extraction, geo-tagging, content translation, rule engines, etc   V  V IRTUAL I NFORMATION C LOUD I NFRASTRUCTURE   The physical infrastructure of the information oriented architecture and ma 3 tch is dynamic as well, and can run on low-end servers, and is vendor independent. In principle multiple nodes can run on a single \(virtual\er. Each time privacy, security, or information access is a concern, a new physical distributed node can be added. Organizations can directly or indire ctly connect to each other \(Fig. 9 Organizations may share a physical server \(Organization A and B\, have a dedicated server \(Organization C\use delegated servers for each of their resources \(Organization D   Fig. 9. Virtual Information Cloud Infrastructure  VI  M A 3 TCH O PPORTUNITIES   With ma 3 tch there is no need to exchange bulk information to achieve integral data fusion and analysis between parties and there is no need to entrust sensitive data to a third party Timeliness increases as relevant information is identified in real time, and is pushed or pulled when needed: no unnecessary information needs to be processed, cleaned or reviewed, which also prevents huge backlogs. Quality and reliability are enhanced as information can be processed interpreted, amended and checked for compliance at the source  Although the technology is designed for intelligence purposes, the dynamic architecture \(due to the large variety of information FIUs process\ makes it suitable for many other industries, and cross domain integration: government commercial, financial, telecom, biomedical, telecom, law enforcement, compliance, etc  At a national level many distributed government agencies deal with privacy sensitive information. They are expected to work together but are often \(not without reason\mited by privacy regulations. This may for example prevent or limit linking weapon permits to mentally ill patients, detecting abuse of social security systems, linking sexual offences to social services. When incidents happen, in many cases the information was available, but not connected where and when it was needed. Ma 3 tch makes it possible to find where this otherwise unknown\nt information is available in real time. This can help social security or tax officials to identify fraud, hospitals to identify emerging health threats, banks to conduct joint compliance and risk assessments, etc. It can be used to analyze distributed telecom/internet traffic to combat cybercrime, and could provide an alternative to centralized DNA or electronic patient file databases; at a national level but also at an international level  At international level benefits even further increase Countries have lots of comparable agencies that perform similar but distributed activities in each jurisdiction. Ma 3 tch allows agencies of countries with a shared mission to identify relevant remote information, and use each otherís knowledge to learn, cooperate and collaborate. For example to anonymously ëmatchí convictions between countries in order to identify criminal activities moving across borders. When privacy sensitive data are involved, for example in international collaboration between intelligence agencies on money laundering and terrorist financing, ma 3 tch identifies links, threats, trends and shifts between countries that otherwise remain undetected. Similarly hospitals could ma 3 tch biomedical data to detect trends and threats in healthcare in real time. Ma 3 tch shifts the focus from reactive to proactive  


International law enforcement agencies \(like Interpol and Europol\ay use ma 3 tch for real time identification of relevant \(need to know\ information on ongoing cases. It provides virtual access to information when and where it is needed \(financial, telecom, intelligence, etc.\without the need for parties to expose sensitiv e information. The dynamic architecture allows matching virtually any kind of information from any source, at minimal co sts. Also cooperation between Europe and the United State  lik e P N R T F TP  cou l d benefit from the ma 3 tch, and build a collective intelligence and knowledge to identify relevant information, trends and threats as soon as they emerge, without infringing upon security confidentiality and privacy  Ma 3 tch and the information oriented architecture empower data minimization, proportionality and subsidiarity: the guiding principle within the European Union that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authorit It also e n ab les t h e availab il i t y  principle and the objective of the European Union for Member States to obtain information rapidly from private or public authorities of another Member State without the use of coercive measures. Despite of different legal systems and national regulations ma 3 tch enables collaboration opportunities far beyond existing limits and barriers  The information oriented architecture has proven its value as the foundation for FIU.NET: it enables autonomous governed information access, exchange and analysis between the national FIUs \(Financial Intelligence Units\ the EU member states. FIUs can virtually integrate their information without the need to place sensitive information beyond their organizationís premises. Between the EU FIUs there are over 550 information resources, each with their own information standards, policies, processes and data protection rules and regulations. It provides FIUs with secure \(virtual\access to government and commercial databases through a customized unified interface, and allows them to innovate and acquire new services and information resources as one virtual enterprise  With the information ma 3 tch FIUs can detect relevant information between each other, but also with commercial data sources, without leaving an y traces. Within this diverse and complex environment, ma 3 tch technology enables joint information analysis and innovation capabilities otherwise impossible to achieve. But also at a national level FIUs can benefit from ma 3 tch to enhance local analysis capabilities, and by using it for \(cross border\reporting by exchanging ma 3 tch filters with reporting institutions \(reducing administrative burdens, and enhancing national investigations  FIUs have already named the emerging information and knowledge ëscarefully powerfulí, and now face a new challenge: to deal with the emerging streams of real time information and knowledge  DATA DATA KNOWLEDGE Structure, Patterns, Indicators WISDOM Understanding DATA DATA DATA  VIRTUAL INFORMATION Virtually Linked Elements    Context Connect Meaning Interpret Insight Learn  Ma 3 tch Decentralized Information Oriented Architecture  Fig. 10. Building a dynamic collective networked intelligence  VII  C ONCLUSIONS   Ma 3 tch builds a dynamic networked collective intelligence  Fig. 10\that provides participating parties with tremendous information and knowledge advantages. Relevant information links and knowledge distributed between parties are detected in real time as soon as they emerge. It gives governmental and commercial organizations a unique information and knowledge position that otherwise would be impossible to achieve. It provides a global overview for strategic decision making and generates knowledge that otherwise would remain distributed, hidden and undetected. Integral operational and strategic analysis on distributed data without infringing upon privacy or security advances results beyond what is otherwise possible. Privacy and knowledge do not conflict but strengthen each other, maximizing both privacy AND knowledge  The information oriented architecture provides a dynamic and flexible foundation for decentralized information access exchange, and anal ysis that enables unique strategic advantages. It enhances data minimization, proportionality and subsidiarity and maximizes voluntary and reciprocital communication, coordination, cooperation and collaboration It strengthens coherence and bridges legal, organizational informational and technological differences between autonomous parties. It shapes a dynamic virtual enterprise that enables parties to operate as one, and quickly and cost effectively adapt to emergi ng changes and opportunities  Understanding the ma 3 tch technology requires a paradigm shift, not just in understanding what is possible, but perhaps even more important in how organizations, governments central authorities, legislator s, data protection offices and information managers look at collaboration and information technology problems and solutions. Information from any national and/or international d ata source can be virtually integrated. It advances both privacy AND knowledge beyond conventional limitations: ma 3 tch opportunities start where other possibilities stop

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
