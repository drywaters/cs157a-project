komerath@gatech.edu Abstract\227 This is an update of the Space Power Grid architecture for space-based solar power with an improved design of the collector/converter link the primary heater and the radiator of the active thermal control system The Space Power Grid offers an evolutionary approach towards TeraWatt-level Spacebased solar power The use of millimeter wave frequencies 050around 220GHz\051 and Low-Mid Earth Orbits shrinks the size of the space and ground infrastructure to manageable levels In prior work we showed that using Brayton cycle conversion of solar power allows large economies of scale compared to the linear mass-power relationship of photovoltaic conversion With high-temperature materials permitting 3600 K temperature in the primary heater over 80 percent cycle ef\002ciency was shown with a closed helium cycle for the 1GW converter satellite which formed the core element of the architecture Work done since the last IEEE conference has shown that the use of waveguides incorporated into lighter-than-air antenna platforms can overcome the dif\002culties in transmitting millimeter wave power through the moist dense lower atmosphere A graphene-based radiator design conservatively meets the mass budget for the waste heat rejection system needed for the compressor inlet temperature Placing the ultralight Mirasol collectors in lower orbits overcomes the solar beam spot size problem of high-orbit collection The architecture begins by establishing a power exchange with terrestrial renewable energy plants creating an early revenue generation approach with low investment The approach allows for technology development and demonstration of high power millimeter wave technology A multinational experiment using the International Space Station and another power exchange satellite is proposed to gather required data and experience thus reducing the technical and policy risks The full-scale architecture deploys pairs of Mirasol sunlight collectors and Girasol 1 GW converter satellites to ramp up space solar power level to over 5.6 TeraWatts by year 50 from project start Runway-based launch and landing are required to achieve the launch productivity as well as the cost reductions to enable such a large deployment on schedule Advancements in the certainty of millimeter wave conversion technology and runway-based space access are seen to be the outstanding issues in proceeding to full-scale Space Solar Power T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1 N OMENCLATURE                                 1 2 I NTRODUCTION

Solar Power 050SSP\051 As presented in Reference the Space Po wer Grid 050SPG\051 architecture laid out in this paper makes 002ve departures from the traditional approaches and shows that these open a clear path to this long-held dream They are as follows 1  Use primary Brayton cycle turbomachine conversion of highly concentrated sunlight rather than photovoltaics to convert solar power in space to electrical power This makes an order of magnitude improvement to the speci\002c power 2  Separate out the collection of sunlight from the conversion which requires large mass Bring the converters down from Geosynchronous Earth Orbit to 2000 kilometer orbits thereby decreasing antenna sizes by a factor of over 4 along with a launch cost reduction 1 


3  Use the atmospheric propagation window at 220 GHz for millimeter wave beaming rather than 5.8 GHz thereby achieving a reduction in antenna size by another factor of six This no doubt incurs technical risk but the risk appears manageable in view of the rapid progress in millimeter wave technology and its applications 4  Use tethered and high-altitude lighter-than-air atmospheric platforms to carry antennae Millimeter waveguides in the tethers eliminate the high losses of transit through the wet and dense lower atmosphere while free-\003ying stratospheric platforms can act as relays to small antennae on the ground or on tethered aerostats 5  Use the present imperative to increase terrestrial renewable power generation with its inherent intermittency to set up a synergistic Space Power Grid for power exchange as the initial risk-reduction and market establishment mechanism before launching the massive SSP satellites This opens the way to the global public-private collaboration that is essential to bring about Space Solar Power as a global power solution The various elements of this architecture are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 The rationale and basis for each of these is explained in the paper referring to the progression of the Space Power Grid architecture over the past 6 years The last four items have been presented before but the 002rst and most sign\002cant breakthrough is new and is based on the conceptual design of a 1 GWe converter satellite presented in a companion paper in this conference The roadmap laid out in the paper shows that full replacement of terrestrial fossil power generation with SSP can be achieved within 31 years from project start taking into account realistic consideration of the time needed to build the massive infrastructure needed both for the satellites and for the launch facilities and vehicles to deliver and maintain them in orbit The conclusions from were 1  The Girasol Brayton cycle Intensi\002ed Ef\002cient Conversion Architecture 050InCA\051 offers far better ef\002ciency much higher speci\002c power and a shorter technology path than the direct conversion options previously considered for full-scale Space Solar Power 2  The technical risk and uncertainties in mass and ef\002ciency in developing millimeter wave conversion and beaming remain as the major risks in SSP development The Phase 1 Space Power Grid offers the opportunity to completely address these before the 002rst 1 GWe satellite has to be launched 3  The optical linking between the Mirasol high-orbit collectors and the Girasol converter satellite remains to be veri\002ed along with re\002ning the mass estimate for the Mirasol 4  Both satellite conceptual designs for the Phase 1 waveguide satellite and the Phase 2 Girasol satellite come in well under the mass estimates laid out in the prior iteration of the SPG architecture thereby reducing the uncertainty in the technological and economic projections Clear technological paths if not existing material and component choices have been identi\002ed for several of the components considered to be the most technically risky in the previous iteration 5  Since the viability of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 are independently demonstrated overlapping development is considered to reduce the time to deployment of space solar power generation on a large scale 6  With the 002rst 1 GWe satellite launched 6 years after the 002rst Phase 1 waveguide satellite the baseline 40-percent ef\002cient system is shown to reach 4 Terawatts by Year 40 breaking even by Year 43 at a power selling price of 11 cents but with an NPV trough of nearly 10 Trillion dollars 7  The Intensifed Conversion Archtecture achieves breakeven Figure 1  In Phase 1 a 2000 km constellation of 100 waveguide satellites of 4MT each is built over 9 years transacting 60MW power each between terrestrial power plants and customers Waveguides inside aerostat tethers minimize atmospheric losses by Year 31 with a much smaller NPV trough less then 3 Trillion dollars at a selling price of 11 cents per kWh or can breakeven by Year 48 with an NPV trough of 9 Trillion dollars at a selling price of 6 cents per kWh 8  At the ramp rate used in these calculations SSP installed capacity can exceed 5.6 Terawatts by Year 50 from project start 9  Values of viability paramer k in the region of unity result in viable SSP architectures In brief the technical risk and uncertainties in mass and ef\002ciency in developing millimeter wave conversion and beaming remain the main risks to SSP development using the Space Power Grid approach The Phase 1 SPG addresses these risks before the 1 GW converters and their ultralight collectors are launched The Phase I waveguide satellites and the Phase II Girasol mass estimates come in under the previous estimates that we used in SPG architecture with much reduced uncertainty Overlapping development of phases I and 2 can greatly reduce deployment time of large scale SSP but with increased technical risk The updated architecture presented in IEEE 2012 could achieve breakeven by Year 31 from project start with a trough of Net Present Value 050NPV\051 2 


Figure 2  In Phase 2 a 2GW ultralight Mirasol sunlight collector and a 1GW 220GHz Girasol Brayton cycle converter in orbits near 2000 km form the standard component of a Space Solar Power constellation growing to over 4 TeraWatts of SSP by Year 40 The Earth link system is expanded from Phase 1 with minimal technical risk limited to below 3 trillion dollars at a power selling price of 0.11/kWh At the ramp rate given in the 2012 paper SSP could reach above 5.6 TeraWatts by Year 50 In the architecture the value of the Viability Parameter k is close to unity 3 P RIOR W ORK Space solar power continues to be a far-off dream because of the extremely high cost of the required infrastructure and the relatively low end-to-end ef\002ciency of the system Prior architectures have been described by Arthur C Clarke Peter Glaser N ASA/Department of Ener gy 3 4 and the SPS2000 initiativ 6 7 8 Most of these assumed that solar power would be converted to direct current electric power by photovoltaic arrays converted to low-frequency microwaves and beamed down from geosynchronous earth orbit to very large terrestrial stations Japanese efforts have evolved from using microwaves to using lasers 10 11  In past work 14 we presented a viability parameter k for SSP de\002ned as k 25000P 021 S/C P is the selling price of space-generated power in KWhe 021 is the ef\002ciency of transmission to the ground S 050kWe/kg\051 is the speci\002c power de\002ned as the power generated in orbit per unit mass needed in orbit to do so and C 050$/kg\051 is the launch cost to low earth orbit 050LEO\051 with LEO de\002ned here as the energy level where the chemical propulsion launcher leaves the payload to be taken further by a high-speci\002c-impulse 050typically ion\051 engine The thumb-rule factor of 25000 is set so that k 030 1 is where the architecture is reasonably certain to be economically viable at a large scale Empirical experience from running various combinations of architecture variables over the 30 to 50 year period needed to bring about 4 TeraWatts of SSP led to the 002nding that with k approaching 1.0 we could make SSP economically viable GEO-based SSP architectures using photovoltaic conversion and microwave frequencies typically project k values less than 0.1 indicating that they are an order of magnitude or more away from being commercially viable The Space Power Grid approach has been described in our prior publications 16 17 18 13 It proposes an initial exchange of power between terrestrial power plants through space mainly enabling a day-night power exchange as well as global reach for all participating power plants This phase reduces the technical risk of space-based solar power transmission establishes a global market for power beamed from space and generates revenue Gigawatt-level collector and converter satellites are launched into this functional power exchange market Thus the SPG architecture provides viable solutions for the problems of cost to 002rst power market acceptance and reducing the risks in developing high-frequency millimeter wave beaming and dynamic power transmission using a constellation of satellites Through the years various aspects have been explored and solutions developed to various problems Reference g a v e an update on these The most important recent advances in the architecture are 1  Advancement of a closed Brayton cycle as the mechanism to convert solar power to electricity with very high conversion ef\002ciency Reference sho wed that essentially 80 percent conversion to high-frequency AC power can be achieved using a helium cycle to generate mechanical power and the electrical generator technology of nuclear power plants to convert to electric power Brayton cycle turbomachines show excellent advantages in speci\002c power as the power level increases in contrast to photovoltaic systems that offer no better than linear scaling In other words large engines achieve much higher power per unit mass than small engines In addition the high turbine inlet temperatures and pressure ratios that can be achieved with solar-heated systems in space enable high thermal ef\002ciency in turn reducing the mass of the active thermal control system required to radiate the waste heat into space The net effect is a breakthrough in the speci\002c power of the system enabling values well above 1.5 2  Advancement of an aerostat-based ground receiver transmitter 21 Perhaps the biggest objection to the use of the millimeter wave spectrum for power transmission is the high loss encountered when transiting the dense moist lower atmosphere Older data from the astronomy community 050for instance sho w that reception at 2800 m altitude 050Mauna Kea Hawaiian islands observatory\051 is more than 95 percent ef\002cient in the 200-220 GHz range for dry air The absorption spectrum is relatively smooth in this region so that data from slightly different frequencies can 3 


also be used to gauge losses Recent work sho ws that opacity is over 90 percent up to a moisture level of 1.25mm at 275 GHz and beyond 3mm at 150GHz The 220 GHz value which was not examined in this reference may be expected to be closer to that at 150 GHz than to 275 GHz based on the older broad-spectrum data In fact at 150 GHz sho ws that transmission is above 95 percent up to a moisture level of 2.5mm Mean moisture level for the winter atmosphere above Mauna Kea is given as 1.68mm of water column Thus the problem is the heavy loss due to moisture and denser air below this level down to sea level A radical solution to this problem is to place the millimeter wave antennae on lighter-than-air tethered aerostats parked at 4000 meters or more above mean sea level The 4000m level is quite practical using present-day aerostats and tethers and it is above the level of most of the moisture even of the monsoons of south Asia which pose the issue of continuous cloud cover for some months The tethers would incorporate ef\002cient waveguides Commercially available waveguides have been found that offer both the power density and the ef\002ciency to make the lower-atmosphere transit as ef\002cient as the transit between space and 4000m for which very ef\002cient windows have been identi\002ed in the 200 220 GHz millimeter wave regime Reference addressed concerns raised after the 2011 Inter national Space Development Conference in Huntsville where experts began to agree that the roadmap to viable SSP had become much clearer It re\002ned the choices in the SPG parameters identi\002ed some alternative routes towards various related objectives and reduced uncertainty in prediction Speci\002c results and conclusions dealt with the following 1  Re\002ned parameter table with detailed references to focus discussion on the input to SSP architecture Emphasis is on the speci\002c power launch cost to LEO and end-to-end ef\002ciency 2  Re\002ned overall ef\002ciency predictions 3  Exploration of alternatives for those who would like to emphasize or accelerate different steps and paths 4  Re\002ned identi\002cation of research and development needs to achieve certain key parameters 5  Results on the need schedule and hence market for launchers to deliver the huge mass requirement of worldwide SSP 6  The need for synergy with terrestrial energy industry to develop SSP showing that this apparent detour is justi\002ed by the long-term cost reduction early risk reduction early public acceptance of beamed power through Space and public support 7  A much quicker deployment timetable to replace terrestrial fossil power generation with SSP 4 A RCHITECTURE U PDATE Summary of Updates In this paper we present the following advances to what we showed in 1  Improved orbital calculations for the Mirasol-Girasol link The Mirasol is now brought down to reduce the distance between the Mirasol and Girasol in order to overcome the solar beam divergence and spot size problem without major optical system complexity 2  The heater design for the primary solar heat absorption is improved 3  The design of the radiator for the closed helium Brayton Figure 3  Conceptual sketch of the Phase 1 waveguide power exchange satellite From Dessanti et al IEEE Aerospace Conference 2012 cycle is improved using graphene sheets 4  The effect of a lighter-than-air platform system to receive and transmit the power with waveguides transmitting it through the lower atmosphere is considered 5  The component mass estimates for the SPG architecture are compared with those developed for other SSP concepts by other teams and this is used to justify the large improvement that we show Phase 1 The Phase 1 waveguide satellites shown in Figure 3 have not been updated since last year It has been suggested that using these satellites as mirrors to redirect millimeter wave beams rather than use antennae and waveguides might be feasible In addition the graphene-based radiator designs presented under the Girasol section may offer advantages Both of the above would be useful to reduce the satellite mass below the present 3800kg estimates but since the present mass estimate is already quite adequate to project a viable Phase 1 commercial model these are not of high priority at present Millimeter wave generation and beaming Millimeter wave generation from high-frequency alternating currents poses uncertainties because there have not been civilian applications requiring high power and low weight in this frequency regime Ampli\002er ef\002ciences over 90 percent are projected but the speci\002c power 050power per unit mass\051 is not established since most published applications to-date are for microdevices where there is large overhead The mass penalty of this conversion was conservatively estimated using speci\002c power values obtained in the 1980s The issues in millimeter wave generation and beaming are summarized in  4 


Figure 4  Mirasol aereal density needed to meet the mass budget Phase 2 Mirasol orbits and design The SPG architecture separates the large area needed to collect enough sunlight to generate a Gigawatt of electric power from the conversion and power beaming functions We initially conceptualized the solar farms as ultralight re\003ectors in orbits that are high enough to be in perpetual sunlight rather than be hard linked to the Girasols We call these high-orbit re\003ectors Mirasols because they perpetually view the Sun To reach 5.6TWe of Space Solar Power over 5600 Girasols and 5600 Mirasols would be needed with some additional Mirasols for night-area coverage of the Girasols The Mirasol large-area sunlight collectors have been moved from the prior 20000 km orbits down close to 2000 km orbit heights This change removes the need for complex optical designs to bring down the spot size and improve the capture effectiveness of the Girasol concentrator/converter satellites In particular it reduces the size of the Mirasols since the loss of sunlight due to spillage is reduced The Mirasols are now proposed as ultralight sunlight collectors consisting of 960 pieces each with its own actuator reducing the amount of mirror turning needed as the satellite focuses sunlight on one Girasol after another The low orbit implies faster rate of redirection of the beam The number of Mirasols has to be increased to provide night-side coverage Some of the cost increase to deploy more satellites is compensated by the decrease in launch cost compared to the 20,000 km orbit locations used before Although the large-area ultralight Mirasol collectors are in orbits not far from those of the 1-GW Girasol converter craft they are kept physically separate because of the need for each Mirasol to switch between Girasols based on the direction and availability of sunlight By making the Mirasols larger than needed to supply a single Girasol the number of Mirasols needed can be reduced even with the shadow/night problem associated with the lower orbit The aereal density requirement of the Mirasols to meet the mass allowance in the system mass budget is shown in Figure 4 The design point has an aereal density of 0.06kg per square meter The Mirasols also require substantial propulsion fuel to correct their orbits for the effects of solar radiation pressure Figure 5 shows the effect of solar radiation pressure on these ultralight craft and the propulsion requirement associated Figure 5  Effect of solar radiation pressure on the Mirasols and the propulsion requirement to counter this effect with it The Girasol designs have been detailed more in the present paper The heater section is now seen to be designed from Hafnium Carbide tubes to absorb the solar heating and take the helium working 003uid to over 3600K The 002rst stage turbine blades are also expected to be designed from Hafnium Carbide Thin graphene sheets with their extremely high thermal conductivity temperature resistance and transparency are proposed to form the outer window for the sunlight to enter the pressurized heater section 5 A SSUMPTIONS AND P ARAMETER C HOICES In Table 1 the present assumptions and parameter choices of the Space Power Grid architecture calculation are listed going from choice of frequency and altitude to the Net Present Value calculation to ensure breakeven by Year 17 for Phase 1 and Year 50 for 5.6 Terawatts of installed SSP Some parameters change between Phase 1 and Phase 2-3 These data are reproduced from Most important of these assumptions is the launch cost to LEO In Phase 1 it is around 2500 per kg but in Phase 2 and 3 we assume that it comes down to 1300 per kg or lower because launch operations become routine and use runway-based launchers 6 B ASES OF P ARAMETER V ALUES 1  B1 The 220GHz window offers up to 90 transmission through a dry atmosphere compared to 95 below 10GHz and 92 at 140GHz Above 10GHz wet weather operation is poor at low power levels Continuous megawatt-level beaming through a raincloud remains to be explored With the tethered aerostat option presented low-loss transmission through the lower atmosphere is enabled using waveguides built into the tethers 2  B2 Solar power can be converted to DC using highintensity PV arrays at over 42 ef\002ciency and from DC to microwave beamed power with roughly 80 ef\002ciency  W e assume 40 ef 002cienc y with 220GHz con v er sion Direct conversion using optical antennae perhaps made of nano\002bers may of fer ef 002ciencies well abo v e 40 Theoretically 80 conversion is possible The Intensi\002ed Conversion Architecture 050InCA\051 design for the Girasol argues that over 80 percent conversion ef\002ciency can be achieved 5

B37 using primary Brayton cycle conversion 3  B3 80 conversion from line frequency to beamed microwaves has been demonstrated We projected initially that conversion to 220GHz can reach at least this ef\002ciency However for single-frequency conversion to 220 GHz modern solid state ampli\002ers are projected to achieve over 90 percent conversion 4  B4 A reciprocal conversion ef\002ciency of 90 is deemed possible for the same reason 5  B5 Atmospheric propagation data at 220GHz 6  B6 and B7 Approximate estimates 7  B8 Aereal density of 3 to 7 grams per square meter are cited for solar sail craft Mass including support structures is much smaller than the value that we have assumed 8  B9 A 5 allowance for other systems is conservative but we have not detailed the subsystems 9  B10 Re\003ector may be similar to B8 but some thermal control is needed in view of the intensi\002ed sunlight and lower Phase 2 orbits demand stronger structures 10  B11 Converter mass per unit power is a critical limiting technology We assume this value of 0.5 Kg/MWe at large power levels with 300-sun intensi\002ed sunlight It is feasible with direct conversion or mechanical-electric conversion 11  B12 The Phase 1 SPG satellite is conceptualized as transmitting and receiving antennae connected through waveguides with minimal internal dissipation This drives thermal management system mass For a narrow-band tuned antenna and waveguides 1 loss may be conservative The waveguides now speci\002ed which are capable of handling a broader range of millimeter waves achieve considerably better than that transmission at 220 GHz 12  B13 With 220GHz the antennae is sized for 96.1 capture with an Airy constant of 10.49 in the equation for diffraction-limited antenna size rather than the 84 percent achieved with a constant of 2.44 13  B14 Ground antenna ef\002ciency is taken as 0.9 based on claims of people in the microwave beaming community 14  B15 The effective diameter of the receiving antenna on the Phase 1 spacecraft is taken to be 50m 15  B16 Orbit height of 1900 miles enables a sunsynchronous orbit where each satellite stays in view for a few minutes each time 16  B17 Each ground station is assumed to have a clear view of the sky down to 45 degrees from the zenith This is conservative but atmospheric propagation loss data are available for 45-degree transmission 17  B18 A design distance of 2400km is chosen for intersatellite beaming to size the space antennae When used for longer distance beaming this implies either a loss at the receiver or a need for larger receivers 18  B19 Because revenue comes from transacted power there is a lower limit on the power transacted per satellite for economic viability This limit may be down near 10MW The 60MW level is chosen because the intensities of beams at the ground and at the spacecraft are still kept moderate 19  B20 Collector diameter is set to 300m arbitrarily 20  B21 Cooling system mass The assumed level is roughly half of that on an existing spacecraft Note that with the Phase 1 satellites and Girasols total system mass is used directly from the papers on their conceptual design in the relevant architecture cases Refer to those papers for details 21  B22 Launch cost to LEO is assumed at reasonable minimum achievable value for the near term in Phase 1 and at a value projected by SSP proponents for the long-term to be consistent with other SSP architecture projections 22  B23 Transfer from LEO to 002nal orbits and orbit corrections are assumed to use Krypton thrusters and the required delta-v is doubled from the Hohmann transfer level to account for the continuous low-thrust mode 23  B24 5M per year/satellite from NASA-Air Force Cost Model for 36 sats Cost decreases as constellation grows 24  B25 An allowance of 1000Kg provides for miscellaneous sensors and systems on each Phase 1 craft 25  B26 1B development cost assumed for the technology and procedures to exchange beamed power with satellites The number of ground stations is assumed to be twice the number of Phase 1 and Phase 2 satellites 26  B27 In addition a 25M cost is assigned to each ground facility to install equipment to interact with SPG 27  B28 Typical US utility power production cost 0.04 per KWH 28  B29 Assume that Phase 1 SPG power will be sold at 17 cents per KWH Customers at solar plants will 002nd this reasonable because it saves the immense costs of installing auxiliary generation equipment 29  B30 and 31 The SPG part of the ground facilities are attuned to the parameters of the satellites 30  B32 6 discount rate on 002nancing needed for the SPG given low interest rates prevailing today and given that the massive investment needed for Phase 2 SPG can only come through international collaboration and central banks 6

parameters for the Mirasol concentrator array is shown in Table 2 Girasol A mass summary for the different subsystems is shown in Table 3 This system mass summary re\003ects re\002ned estimates of the spacecraft cooling system and the Mirasol optical system mass calculations as these systems have been investigated in further detail 8 C OMPARISON W ITH O THER A RCHITECTURES Table 4 attempts to answer the sanity-check question of why we are getting speci\002c power values so much higher than previous SSP architecture proposals and accordingly so much lower costs We are exchanging the impossibility of GEO-based microwave architectures for the technical risk in developing millimeter wave conversion and beaming systems in the near future We maintain that this is an acceptable risk The table uses results given in the detailed architecture study conducted by Penn and Law gi ving the mass b udgets for the various components of each proposed SSP architecture We see from that comparison that the antenna mass scales approximately in inverse proportion to frequency Since the frequency of the SPG architecture is 220 GHz compared to the 2.4 GHz of previous proposals there is a 2order of magnitude reduction in antenna size expected Not all of this will be realized since millimeter wave antenna may be expected to have higher mass per unit area than microwave antennae However the net result is that antenna mass becomes a minor component of total mass Next we see that the Photovoltaic array mass is a dominant component of prior architectures Brayton cycle turbomachines offer a very strong advantage in power per unit mass as the power level increases unlike photovoltaic systems that scale linearly in mass with power Thirdly with high-temperature highly intensi\002ed solar thermal conversion the Girasol achieves very high thermal and thermodynamic ef\002ciency of 80 percent compared to the 20 percent to 25 percent that photovoltaic systems can even aspire to This means that the collector area for PV systems must be 3 to 4 times as large as what is needed for a Brayton cycle system for the same converted power Conversion from mechanical to AC electric power can be achieved with extremely high ef\002ciency as shown by terrestrial nuclear plants and this ef\002ciency exceeds the DC to AC conversion ef\002ciency of photovoltaic systems In turn the low ef\002ciency of photovoltaic systems compared to the Brayton cycle system means that the active thermal control system mass must be up to the task of radiating out 3 to 4 times as much heat in the PV case as in the Brayton cycle Girasol case The other major component of system mass is the propulsion system along with orbit-correction fuel The mass of these scales proportionally to the baseline system mass above so that they are also much less in the SPG architecture than in the prior architecture proposals Thus we see that the mass total is easily an order of magnitude less in the SPG architecture than in the previously proposed photovoltaic GEO-based microwave architectures A reviewer pointed out that the in-space mass needed for a Girasol-Mirasol pair was not much larger than that of the International Space Station whose mass is cited as around 450,000kg Indeed there is no reason why an uninhabited remotely-controlled ultralight collector satellite and a 1GW converter adding up to some 650,000kg should be any more massive than that There is no need for human life-sustaining facilities or of docking facilities once on-orbit maintenance is perfected since the major components of the Girasol will be accessible as replaceable modules from outside The larger issue in SSP is that we will need thousands of these 1GW collector/converter pairs in orbit to reach the TeraWatt levels needed to replace terrestrial primary power Looking at the launch vehicle challenges faced by the ISS over the years it is clear that an early determined investment in runway-based heavy-lift space access should be a top priority 9 E CONOMICS The assumptions made in the economics calculations are listed above The work done to re\002ne the designs of the 7

employees and extensive testing of each vehicle dominates launch cost and the series of steps needed for each launch precludes much greater launch productivity than is currently seen To make space launch operations routine and frequent the operation must be brought to an airline-level of repetitiveness and ef\002ciency This means runway-based launchers that can take off and land horizontally In turn this implies airbreathing propulsion for the atmospheric section of the 003ight probably with recapture of oxygen by liquefying air on the way up Development of horizontal takeoff and landing space launchers is hindered by the lack of demand for space launch In turn SSP cannot be deployed without such a capability In the 002nal paper a section will be added on the development of runway-based launchers with estimates of the payload development cost number of launching stations types and number of launchers needed frequency of launches and types of payloads 11 S UMMARY OF N EEDED R ESEARCH AND D EVELOPMENT Several items remain as essential technology development These are brie\003y enumerated below 1  Millimeter wave conversion to and from alternating current continues

the space-based component of the Space Power Grid architecture for SSP now promises to be above 1.5 kW/kg 2  Miliimeter wave dynamic beaming from 2000 km orbits is seen to provide the expected reduction in system mass over architectures with GEO-based microwave beaming 3  The use of a solar Brayton cycle provides the remaining improvement in speci\002c power due to the favorable scaling of turbomachine system mass with increasing power compared to the linear scaling of photovoltaic architectures 4  Bringing down the Mirasol solar collectors to 2000 km orbits enables better capture of the solar power using the Girasol concentrators 5  The speci\002c power can be further improved using graphene-based radiators 6  The mass budgets speci\002ed in the 2011 version of the SPG

 13 continuity  The weather and climate models used by forecasters and scientists in the United States and throughout the world rely heavily on data from NASA-developed and NOAAoperated polar-orbiting satellites.  The continuity of that data is critical.  Without these satellite observations advance notice of extreme events would be diminished Accurate three to ten day forecasts allow businesses, Federal and state governments, and the American public to prepare for severe weather events, reducing personal injury and death, safeguarding property, live stock and cutting the length of time businesses are shut down.  For example: The path of an anticipated hurricane, its accompanying storm surge, and the coastal flood potential are critical inputs to the decisions necessary to conduct safe and strategic evacuations of coastal residents.  Conversely, inaccurate forecasts can lead to needless and costly evacuations that undermine the public\222s confidence in weather warnings, and ultimately compromise evacuation response in the face of a real emergency.  Further inland, accurate rainfall forecasts are essential to mitigate against flash flooding and mudslides  Data continuity over decades, and across multiple and diverse Earth Science Missions, is providing, for the first time, the ability to look at our planet as a system and to correlate changes within these data sets with observed climate trends.  The NASA Earth Observing System's weather instruments have enabled the first improvement in weather forecasting skill in more than a decade.  Over the last twelve years, instruments on NASA\222s Terra and Aqua satellites have provided the first global measurements of aerosols in our atmosphere, which come from natural sources such as volcanoes and dust storms.  Other instruments onboard the Aura satellite study the processes that regulate the abundance of ozone in the atmosphere Data from the GRACE and ICESat missions, as well as from spaceborne radar, are used to monitor trends in thickness of the Earth\222s polar ice sheets, while the Jason-1 and Jason-2 missions are recording fluctuations in sea level Together, data integrated from all of these missions provide our scientists with a system level view of our planet\222s ecosystems and the interactions impacting weather and climate on a global scale  Both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA\ have a mandate under the Clean Air Act to monitor ozone-depleting gases and stratospheric depletion of ozone.  A recent joint study performed by NASA and NOAA has shown that the average area covered by the Antarctic ozone hole in 2012 was the second smallest in the last 20 years, while a study in 2011 showed that the amount of ozone destroyed in the Arctic in 2011 was comparable to that seen in some years in the Antarctic where an ozone "hole" has formed each spring since the mid-1980s  NASA and NOAA have been monitoring the ozone layer via ground measurements and with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 1970s.  Long-term ozone monitoring instruments have included TOMS, SBUV/2 Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment series of instruments, the Microwave Limb Sounder, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, and the Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite \(OMPS\strument on Suomi NPP.  Arctic ozone loss has been measured with daily global observations of trace gases and clouds from NASA's Aura and CALIPSO spacecraft.  Ozone is critical to protect the Earth from harmful radiation, and continuing to develop and fund space instruments to measure ozone is necessary to predict future ozone amounts.  The Decadal Survey included a mission called the Global Atmospheric Composition Mission GACM\ continue this study of ozone  Through the use of continuous data, the United States and partnering nations share, converge on and establish the guidelines necessary to manage their resources, reduce pollutants and continue to give their people the quality of life we all currently enjoy  9  C ONCLUSIONS AND R ECOMMENDATIONS   In 2011 the NRC revisited the Decadal Survey report and published a Midterm Assessment Report.  This report stated 223NASA responded favorably and aggressively to the decadal survey, embracing its overall recommendations for Earth observations, missions, technology investments, and priorities for the underlying science.  As a consequence, the science and applications communities have made significant progress over the past 5 y T h i s paper s u mm ari zed  the foundation missions which were in place at the time of the Decadal Survey and the cooperative science realized by flying these satellites in coordinated mission orbits known as the A Train and Morning Constellations. It discussed the systematic way NASA identified the science observations necessary to address the full range of Earth Science questions, and the importance of maintaining scientific breadth.  It presented the new paradigm of developing instruments through multiple programs and decoupling that development from the eventual assembly of instruments and spacecraft to form a mission.  It stressed that for NASA to achieve the goal of developing and flying the missions defined in the Decadal Survey there must be continued funding, available, appropriately sized launch vehicles and a strong supplier base.   The consequences of not having these key elements are a gap in data continuity and a delay in answering the key Earth science questions involved in basic Earth stewardship  Within the next couple of years it is expected that there will be another Decadal Survey.  Given the budget outlook for Earth Science and NASA, there should be a recommendation to shrink the size of the instruments as much as possible while still gaining valuable observations 


 14 Then, recognizing that flying smaller payloads on traditional launch vehicles will be very wasteful, there should be a recommendation to encourage th e efforts that have been started to utilize non-traditional methods of launching instruments including hosting them on commercial satellites, combining them into larger missions that fill the launch vehicle, or sharing rides to space \226 all concepts designed to match up the size of the payload with the size of the launch vehicle.  Lastly, some consideration should be given to the on-orbit architecture of the next generation of missions \226 should they be organized into coordinated orbits such as the Afternoon Constellation and the Morning Constellation, or be put into individual orbits that maximize specific science observations, as the Tier 1 and 2 missions are doing?  Are there other constellation architectures to be explored?  Despite a steady or declining budget outlook, a future with smaller, nimble satellites sharing launch vehicles and cooperating via newly developed constellation architectures could yield a very exciting future for Earth Science  Acknowledgements 227 George Andrew, John Carey, Pete Cline, Ed Hatter, and Carey Lively provided valuable contributions in the writing of this paper  R EFERENCES   1  NASA 2010 Science Plan for NASA\222s Science Mission Directorate NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C    C o u r tes y of Dr. Ste v en P l at n i c k N A S A GS FC  3  Earth Science and Applications from Space National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond The National Academies Press, Washington D.C., 2007  4  Earth Science and Applications from Space: A Midterm Assessment of NASA's Implementation of the Decadal Survey The National Academies Press Washington D.C., 2012   C E N R  I WG EO  2005 Strategic Plan for the U.
