This study proposes a new algorithm, called 
the New Fast UPdate algorithm \(NFUP incrementally mining association rules from large transaction database.  NFUP is a backward method that only requires scanning incremental database.  Rather than rescanning the original database for some new generated frequent itemsets in the incremental database, we accumulate the occurrence counts of newly generated frequent itemsets and delete infrequent itemsets obviously Thus, NFUP need not rescan the original database and to discover newly generated frequent itemsets.  NFUP has good scalability in our simulation 1. Introduction Recent developments in information science have 
resulted in the rapid accumulation of enormous amounts of data.  Consequently, efficiently managing very large databases and quickly retrieving useful information are very important.  Data mining or knowledge discovery techniques are normally used to discover useful information in data warehouses.  They have come to represent an important field research and have been applied extensively to several areas [7 uding fi nancial analysis, market research, industrial retail and decision support Mining association rules is the core task of numerous data mining techniques.  As the amount of data increases 
designing an efficient mining algorithm becomes increasingly urgent; accordingly, two of the main issues concerning data mining are therefore studied extensively herein.  One is the design of algorithms for mining rules or patterns.  The other is the design of algorithms to update and maintain rules, called incremental mining The most celebrated algorithm of the first type is the Apriori algorithm The Apriori al gorithm solves two sub-problems \(1\nd all frequent itemsets, and \(2\o use these frequent itemsets to generate association rules The first sub-problem importantly governs the overall performance of the mining process.  After frequent 
itemsets have been recognized, the corresponding association rules may be derived easily [3  Other efficient approaches have also been presented, including for example those in [1, 2, 6, 10, 11, 16 Existing mining methods cannot be applied to mine a publication like database efficiently.  A publication database is also a transaction database where each item involves an individual exhibition period r a  publication database in Fig. 1, items A  B and C 
are exhibited from 1996 to 2004. However, item F is exhibited from 2002 to 2004.  Traditional mining techniques ignore the exhibition period of each item and use a unique minimum support threshold.  This measure is unfair for new products.  Therefore, the PPM algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem  
Figure 1. Each item has an individual exhibition period In the real world where large amounts of data grow steadily, some old association rules can become useless and new databases may give rise to some implicitly valid patterns or rules.  Hence, updating rules or patterns is also important.  The FUP algorithm is well known in related to 1 Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Stream Data Mining and Applications \(RID E-SDMA05 1097-8585/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


 A sim ple m e thod for solving the updating problem is to reapply the mining algorithm to the entire database, but this approach is time-consuming.  The FUP algorithm reuses information from old frequent itemsets to improve its performance.  Several other approaches to incremental mining have been proposed [5, 9, 11, 13, 14     Although many mining techniques for discovering frequent itemsets and associations have been presented, the process of updating frequent itemsets remains troublesome for incremental databases.  The mining of incremental databases is more complicated than the mining of static transaction databases, and may lead to some severe problems, such as the combination of frequent itemsets occurrence counts in the original database with the new transaction database, or the rescanning of the original database to check whether the itemsets remain frequent while new transactions are added Earlier incremental algorithms have focused on reducing the number of scanning on original database while it is updated.  However, they require the original database to be rescanned at least once in many situations This work presents a novel algorithm NFUP for incremental mining, which is based on FUP.  This algorithm can discover latest rules and does not need to rescan the original database.  This work focuses on the generation of frequent itemsets in incremental publication-like database The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some work on association rules.  Then, Section 3 describes the proposed method \(NFUP\  The experimental results of NFUP will be presented in Section 4. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 5 2. Related Work In 1993, Agrawal et al first defined the mining of association rules in database T h ey c onsi dere d the example following example; 60% of transactions in which bread is purchased are also transactions in which milk is purchased. The formal statement is as follows Let  I   i 1 i 2 i m represent the set of literals, called items The symbol T represents an arbitrary transaction, which is a set of items itemset h that T I Each transaction has a unique identifier TID Let DB be a database of transactions.  Assume X is an itemset; a transaction T contains X if and only if XT An association rule applies in the form XY where X I, Y I and X Y  For example I  ABCDE  X  AC  Y  BE An association rule XY has two properties support and confidence When s of transactions in DB contain XY  the support of the rule XY is s If some of the transactions in DB contain X and, and c also contain Y  then the confidence in the rule XY is c In general, the confidence is expressed in the form confidence XY  support XY   X Given the user-assigned minimum support minSup inimum confidence  minConf thresholds for the transaction database DB the mining of association rules is to find all rules whose support and the confidence, in which are greater than the two respective minimum thresholds.  An itemset is called a frequent itemset when its support is no less than the minSup threshold; otherwise, it is an infrequent itemset  2.1 Apriori Algorithm The Apriori algorithm concentrates primarily on the discovery of frequent itemsets according to a user-defined minSup  h e algorithm relies on t h e fact that an item se t could be frequent only when each of its subset is frequent otherwise, the itemset is infrequent.  In the first pass, the Apriori algorithm constructs and counts all 1-itemsets. \(A k itemset is an itemset that includes k items.\ After it has found all frequent 1-itemsets, the algorithm joins the frequent 1-itemsets with each other to form candidate 2-itemsets.  Apriori scans the transaction database and counts the candidate 2-itemsets to determine which of the 2-itemsets are frequent.  The other passes are made accordingly.  Frequent k 1\sets are joined to form k itemsets whose first k 1 items are identical.  If k 3 Apriori prunes some of the k itemsets; of these k 1\msets have at least one infrequent subset.  All remaining k itemsets constitute candidate k itemsets.  The process is reiterated until no more candidates can be generated Example 2.1 Consider the database presented in Table 1 with a minimum support requirement is 50%.  The database includes 11 transactions.  Accordingly, the supports of the frequent itemsets are at least six.  The first column TID includes the unique identifier of each transaction, and the Items column lists the set of items of each transaction Let C k be the set of candidate k itemsets and F k be the set of frequent k itemsets.  In the first pass, the database is scanned to count C 1 If the support count of a candidate exceeds or equals six, then the candidate is added to F 1  The outcome is shown in Figure 2.  Then F 1 F 1 forms C 2 Apriori-gen function is used to generate C 2  After th e database has been scanned for a second time, Apriori examines which itemset of C 2 exceeds the predetermined threshold.  Moreover C 3 is generated from F 2 as follows Figure 2 presents two frequent 2-itemsets with identical first item, such as BC and BE Then, Apriori tests whether the 2-itemset CE is frequent.  Since CE is a frequent itemset, all the subsets of BCE are frequent Thus BCE is a candidate 3-itemset, or BCE must be pruned.  Apriori stops to look for frequent itemsets when no candidate 4-itemset can be joined from F 3 Apriori scans the database k times when candidate k itemsets are generated 2 Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Stream Data Mining and Applications \(RID E-SDMA05 1097-8585/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

Application of Apriori algorithm 2.2 Fast Update Algorithm \(FUP After a database has been updated, some existing rules are no longer important and new rules may be introduced In 1996, Cheung et al proposed the FUP algorithm to efficiently generate associations in the updated database  h e F U P algorithm relies on Apriori  and c onsi ders only these newly added transactions.  Let db be a set of new transactions and DB  be the updated database \(including all transactions of DB and db   An itemset X is either frequent or infrequent in DB or db Therefore X has four possibilities, as shown in Table 2.  In the first pass, FUP scans db to obtain the occurrence count of each 1-itemset Since the occurrence counts of F k in DB are known in advance, the total occurrence count of arbitrary X is easily calculated if X is in Case 2.  If X is unfortunately in Case 3 DB must be rescanned.  Similarly, the next pass scans db to count the candidate 2-itemsets of db If necessary DB is rescanned.  The process is reiterated until all frequent itemsets have been found.  In the worst case, FUP does not reduce the number of the original database must be scanned Table 2. Four scenarios associated with an itemset in DB  db DB Frequent itemset Infrequent itemset  Frequent itemset Case 1 Frequent Case 2 Infrequent itemset Case 3 Case 4 Infrequent 2.3 Other Incremental Algorithms In 1997, Cheung et al described the FUP 2 algorithm which is a more general incremental technique than FUP FUP 2 is efficient not only on developing of a database but also on trimming as et al proposed another method to accelerate the incremental mining by maintaining the negative border  In 1999 Ayan et al  proposed the UWEP \(Update With Early Pruning\ethod that employs a dynamic look-ahead strategy to update existing frequent itemsets for detecting and removing itemsets that are infrequent in the updated database  In 2001, Lee et al proposed the SWF approach W F  partitions databases into several partitions, and applies a filtering threshold in each partition to generate candidate itemsets.  In 2002, Veloso et al described the ZigZag algorithm which uses tidlist and computes maximal frequent itemsets in the updated database to avoid the generation of many unnecessary candidates 3. New Fast Update Method \(NFUP The key idea behind of previous incremental mining techniques is to reduce the number of times that databases need to be scanned.  Although those techniques may avoid some unnecessary scanning, they do rescan the original database.  The original database is normally much larger than the incremental database.  Therefore, scanning the original database is time-consuming.  This study proposes a new fast update algorithm \(NFUP\for incremental mining of association rules.  NFUP does not require the rescanning of the original database to detect new frequent itemsets or delete invalidate itemsets 3.1 NFUP Algorithm FUP rescans the original database when at least one candidate is in Case 3.  In many situations, new information is more important than old information, such as in publication database, stock transactions, grocery markets 3 Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Stream Data Mining and Applications \(RID E-SDMA05 1097-8585/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


or web-log records.  Consequently, a frequent itemset in the incremental database is also important even if it is infrequent in the updated database To mine new interesting rules in updated database NFUP partitions the incremental database logically according to unit time interval \(month, quarter or year, for example\, assume that the ending time of exhibition period is identical.  NFUP progressively accumulates the occurrence count of each candidate according to the partitioning characteristics.  The latest information is at the last partition of incremental database Therefore, NFUP scans each partition backward, namely the last partition is scanned first and the first partition is scanned last.  As in the preceding section, the original transaction database is denoted as DB where db indicates the incremental portion, and DB  signifies the updated database.  The frequent set of itemsets of DB is known in advance.  The new transaction database db includes n unit time intervals.  Logically db can be divided into n portions and each portion is called a partition db  P 1 P 2  P n where P n denotes the partition n  db m, n represent the continuous time interval from partition P m to partition P n where n m 1 and n N Namely db m, n  P m P m+1  P n-1 P n The NFUP algorithm is an Apriori-like algorithm.  The final set of frequent itemsets consists of the three following types 1 set: frequent itemsets in DB   2 set: frequent itemsets in db m, n  m n  infrequent in db m1 n and 3 r set: frequent itemsets in db m, m but infrequent in db m 1 n  For db n, n  P n process starts at 1-itemsets.  Each candidate or frequent itemset has three attributes 1 X count: includes the occurrence count in current partition 2 X start: includes the partition number of the corresponding starting partition when X becomes an element of frequent set, and 3 X type: denotes one of the three types   and r In the beginning, set  set  and set r are empty After P n has been scanned, all frequent 1-itemsets are added into the set. Each frequent 1-itemset is joined to form 2-itemset candidates.  In P n the process is performed like that of Apriori.  NFUP is applied to the next partition P n 1 whenever no more candidate k itemsets can be generated in P n The occurrence count of each candidate in P n 1 is known after P n 1 is scanned.  In each partition, NFUP determines which candidate k itemset will become an element of  or r set and identifies from which partition the k itemset becomes frequent. After P 1 is scanned, the occurrence count is accumulated with that of DB Figure 3 graphically depicts NFUP process for P m where F is the set F is the set, and F r is the r set  Figure 3.

In Line 1  and r sets are initialized to empty.  In Lines 4 and 7, SubProcedure\(\o scan a portion of db and to compute the support number of each candidate At the same time, it determines which candidate should be added to a proper frequent set or be ignored.  The Apriori-gen function takes frequent k 1\msets to generate k itemset candidates.  The prune step is included in the Apriori-gen function.  Some of the k itemsets are deleted; of these, at least one k 1\sub-itemset is not in F k 1 From Line 10 to Line 18, the final support value of each frequent itemset of set needs to be added its occurrence count in DB Otherwise, they are the elements of set.

All frequent itemsets of DB are known in advance, and presented in Table 4.  Initially, the three types of frequent set are null.  Without loss of generality, suppose DB is the partition zero P 0  frequent k itemsets in P m are also list in Table 4 P 2 is first to be scanned.  In the beginning, these frequent k itemsets in P 2 belong to the set.  Table 5 lists the three types of frequent set.  The column Start states the identity of the start partition.  After P 1 is scanned, the set consists of five entries.  In set, the value of start partition of each frequent k itemset is modified to be one.  Four k itemsets are removed to the set because their total occurrence counts are less than the threshold \(6 * 50% = 3\ Furthermore, the three itemsets E  BE and CE are presented in r set Although BE is frequent in db 1, 2 it is infrequent in P 2 as marked by *.  Finally, NFUP adds the occurrence counts of frequent itemsets in DB to the corresponding frequent itemsets of the set.  In Table 5, the final set remains three entries A  B and C The set and r set increase two and one entries, respectively Table 3.

However AE is no longer interesting from 2002 to 2003.  The itemset E is frequent in traditional incremental rules mining such as FUP, while E is in the r set of the mining result of NFUP.

However, this rescanning phase is unnecessary because all frequent itemsets in DB  are the subset of r Furthermore, all the itemsets contained in set or r set are interesting.  To determine all frequent itemsets in DB  as Apriori or FUP, the important rule could be deleted by pruning some frequent itemsets from the set or r set The set  r t of the mining result of Apriori in DB  The reason is that if DB is divided into n partitions, then the frequent itemset X must appear as a frequent itemset in least one of the n  4. Experimental Results All the experiments were performed on a 1.5GHz Pentium IV PC with 640 MB of main memory, running under Windows 2000 professional.  The algorithm was coded in Visual C++ 6.0.

Therefore, mining must be repeated Valid patterns and rules must to be efficiently generated Incremental mining must usually involve the original database and the new added transactions.  Scanning the original database is very expensive, so the proposed method outperforms others by avoiding the rescanning of the original database This investigation has presented a new method, NFUP for incremental mining.  NFUP does not require the rescanning of the original database and can determine new frequent itemsets at the latest time intervals.  The proposed method uses information available from a following partition to avoid the rescanning of the original database; it requires only the incremental database to be scanned.  In reality, the transaction number of the incremental database is very small in contrast to the original database.  The running time of NFUP rises almost in direct proportion with the transaction number of the incremental database Accordingly, NFUP is suited frequently updated databases In the future, the authors will consider the extension of the NFUP algorithm to sequence rules References  R.

CBA and Neural Networks at 1% confidence level while they are all significantly better than C4.5 decision tree. Taking the interpretability of classification model into account, these two adapted CBA algorithm seem to be appropriate choices for credit scoring because they generated much more compact decision lists \(less sequential rules original CBA. They therefore favour the well-known Occam  s Razor theory and are more suitable for decision makers to understand. A deeper insight into the rules structures shows that original CBA and adapted CBA 1 both focus on generating classification rules that predict good clients \(with bad clients as the default class implication, numerous rules with high confidence but low support have lower ranks than they are in original CBA. These rules are finally discarded since they are not fired by any training samples, which are matched by these rules with higher intensity of implications thus making the decision lists generated by adapted CBA 1 more compact. Adapted CBA 2 mainly mines these classification rules for bad clients \(with good clients as the default class compact rule sets Original CBA Adapted CBA1 Adapted CBA2 C45 NN dataset accuracy no. of rules accuracy num. of rules accuracy no. of rules accuracy accuracy 1 Austr 85.65% 130.5 86.52% 26.4 86.96% 12.4 86.52% 85.07 2 Germ 73.30% 134 74.40% 56.5 73.20% 19.7 72.40% 74.90 3 Bene 72.92% 393 72.30% 186 73.51% 51 70.21% 72.63 Table 2.

Conclusion Intensity of implication is proposed in the beginning as an interestingness measure for association rules Another novel interestingness measure called dilated chi-square is designed by us to reveal the statistical interdependence between the antecedents and consequents of association rules We then adapt CBA algorithm, which can be used to build classifiers based on class association rules, by coupling it with intensity of implication and dilated chi-square respectively. More concretely, Intensity of implication \(or dilated chi-square primary criterion to rank class association rules at the first step of the database coverage pruning procedure in CBA algorithm. Experiments on three credit scoring datasets proved that these two adapted algorithms compared with original CBA, classical C4.5 decision tree and neural network, achieve satisfactory performance and generates classifiers much more compact than CBA 6.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
