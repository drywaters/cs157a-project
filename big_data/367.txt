In last two years efforts have been done also by Hwang and al. in 16, 17, 18]. We recently discovered that the Hwang's MTIM \(Multiple-target Tracking and Identity Management difference between MTIM and GDA-MTT lies fundamentally in the Attribute Data Association procedure. MTIM is based on MAJPDA \(Modified Approximated JPDA pled with RMIMM \(Residual-mean Interacting Multiple Model Global Nearest Neighbour incorporating both kinematics and attribute measurements 


incorporating both kinematics and attribute measurements with more sophisticated fusion rules dealing with fuzzy imprecise and potentially highly conflicting target attribute measurements  last recent attempt for solving the GDA-MTT problem was proposed by Bar-Shalom and al. in [6] and expressed as a multiframe assignment problem where the multiframe association likelihood was developed to include the target classification results based on the confusion matrix that specifies the prior accuracy of the target classifier. Such multiframe s-D assignment algorithm should theoretically provide performances close to the optimality for MTT systems but remains computationally greedy. The purpose of this paper is to compare the performances of several fusion rules usable into our new GDA-MTT algorithm based on a MTT scenario similar to the one given in 6] but actually more difficult since seven closed spaced maneuvering targets are considered belonging only to two classes within clutter and with only 2D kinematic measurements and attribute measurement This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present our approach for GDA-MTT algorithm emphasizing only on the new developments in comparison with our previous GDA-MTT algorithm, developed in [27, 241. In our previous works, we proved the efficiency of GDAMTT \(in term of Track Purity Performance 0-7803-9286-8/05t$20.00  2005 IEEE 930 Hybrid rule of combination over the GDA-MTT based on Dempster's rule but also over the KDA-MTT \(Kinematicsonly-based Data Association gets scenarios \(with and without clutter remind the main fusion rules we investigate for our new GDA-MTT algorithm. Most of these rules are well-known in the literature [24, 22], but the PCR5 rule presented here is really a new one recently proposed in [25, 26]. Due to space limitations, we assume the reader familiar with basics on Target Tracking [2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12], on DST [23 and on DSmT [24] for fusion of uncertain, imprecise and possibly highly conflicting information. Section 4 presents and compares several Monte Carlo results for different versions of our GDA-MTT algorithm based on the fusion rules proposed in section 3 for a MTT scenario similar to the one in [6]. Conclusion is given in section 5 2 General principle of GDA-MTT Classical target tracking algorithms consist mainly in two basic steps: data association to associate proper measurements \(usually kinematics measurement z\(k representing either position, distance, angle, velocity acceleration, etc ing to estimate and predict state of targets once data association has been performed. The first step is very important for the quality of tracking performances since its goal is to associate correctly \(or at least as best as possible or eventually new born targets very difficult to solve in dense multitarget and cluttered environment. To eliminate unlikely \(kinematics-based observation-to-track pairing, the classical validation test is carried on the Mahalanobis distance d2 \(i, j zj \(k kIk - 1 k zj \(k kIk - 1 computed from the measurement zj \(k z \(k k - 1 see [2] for details defined for the surveillance region, a clustering procedure defines the clusters of the tracks with shared observations Further the decision about observation-to-track associations within the given cluster is considered. The Extended Kalman Filter coupled with a classical IMM \(Interacting Multiple Model update the targets state vectors This new GDA-MTT improves data association process 


This new GDA-MTT improves data association process by adding attribute measurements \(like amplitude information or RCS \(radar cross section 6] Target ID decision coupled with confusion matrix, to classical kinematic measurements to increase the performances of the MTT system. When attribute data are available, the generalized \(kinematics and attribute ratios are used to improve the assignment. The GNN approach is used in order to make a decision for data association. Our new GDA approach consists in choosing a set of assignments {Xij}, for i 1l,...n and j 1, . .. m, that assures maximum of the total generalized likelihood ratio sum by solving the classical assignment problem minm j&gt; j aijXij using extended Munkres algorithm [13] and where a3j - log\(LRgen \(i, j LRgen\(i, j i,j i, j i,j LRa\(i, j spectively, and 1 if measurement j is assigned to track i Xij 0 otherwise where the elements aij of the assignment matrix A = [aij take the following values [21 j-log\(LRk\(i, j i, j if dA &gt; -y if d?. &lt; -y The solution of the assignment matrix is the one that minimizes the sum of the chosen elements. We solve the assignment problem by realizing the extension of Munkres algorithm, given in [13]. As a result one obtains the optimal measurements to tracks association. Once the optimal assignment is found, i.e. the \(what we feel sociation is available, then standard tracking filter is used depending on the dynamics of the target under tracking We will not recall classical tracking filtering methods here which can be found in many standard textbooks [5, 12 2.1 Kinematics Likelihood Ratios for GDA The kinematics likelihood ratios LRk\(i, j are quite easy to obtain because they are based on classical statistical models for spatial distribution of false alarms and for correct measurements [5]. LRk\(i, j as LRk\(i,j i,j likelihood function that the measurement j originated from target \(track measurement j originated from false alarm. At any given time k, LFtue is defined' as LFtnj,e =- ii,ut\(k k where r is the number of the models \(in our case of two nested models r = 2 is used for EKF-IMM k probability \(weight k is the likelihood function that the measurement j is originated from target \(track LF1\(k ed1\(i,J 2Ir7S_li\(k LFfalse Pf a/!VC, where Pfa is the false alarm probability and Vl is the resolution cell volume chosen as in [6] as K = Inli R In our case, ri 2 is the measurement vector size and Rij are sensor error standard deviations for azimuth:3 and distance D measurements 2.2 Attribute Likelihood Ratios for GDA The major difficulty to implement GDA-MTT depends on the correct derivation of coefficients aij, and more specifically the attribute likelihood ratios LRa\(i, j sociation between measurement j and target i based only on attribute information. When attribute data are available and their quality is sufficient, the attribute likelihood ratio helps a lot to improve MTT performances. In our case, the Iwhere indexes i and j have been omitted here for LF notation convenience 931 target type information is utilized from RCS attribute mea 


target type information is utilized from RCS attribute measurement through fuzzification interface proposed in [27 A particular confusion matrix is constructed to model the sensor's classification capability. This work presents different possible issues to evaluate LRa\(i, j nature of the attribute information and the fusion rules used to predict and to update each of them. The specific attribute likelihood ratios are derived within both DSmT and DST frameworks 2.2.1 Modeling the Classifier The way of constructing the confusion matrix is based on some underlying decision-making process based on specific attribute features measurements. In this particular case, it is based on the fuzzification interface, described in our previous work [27, 24]. Through Monte Carlo simulations the confusion matrix for two different average values of RCS is obtained, in terms of the first frame of hypotheses 01 ={\(S B in [27], defining the correspondence between RCS values and the respective targets' types, the final confusion matrix T = [tij] in terms of the second frame of hypotheses 02 = {\(F C tij represent the probability to declare that the target type is i when its real type is j. Thus the targets type probability mass vector for classifier output is the j-th column of the confusion matrix T. When false alarms arise, their mass vector consists in an equal distribution of masses among the two classes of target 2.2.2 Attribute Likelihood Ratio within DSmT The approach for deriving LRa\(i, j on relative variations of pignistic probabilities [24] for the target type hypotheses, Hj \(j -1 for Fighter, j = 2 for Cargo assignment. These pignistic probabilities are derived after the fusion between the generalized basic belief assignments of the tracks old attribute state history and the new attribute/ID observation, obtained within the particular fusion rule. It is proven [24] that this approach outperforms most of the well-known ones for attribute data association It is defined as A P - 'Ai \(P*JZZ T where Z H -PT j AI \(P* E2- ~ z Hj J Hj 2 IPT Z=T \(Hj -PT,\(Hj P*ZT Ej=1 P;\(Hj i.e. Ai\(P*lZz Tj observation mass vector to be the same as the attribute mass vector of the considered real target, i.e. mz  The decision for the right association relies on the minimum of expression \(1 LRgeri is looking for the maximum value, we define the final form of the attribute likelihood ratio to be inversely proportional to the 6i\(P the track, i.e. LRa\(i, j P 2.2.3 Attribute Likelihood Ratio within DST LRa\(i, j likelihood function proposed in [3, 12]. If one considers the observation-to-track fusion process using Dempster's rule the degree of conflict kij is computed as the assignment of mass committed to the conflict, i.e. m\(0 assignment is, the less likely is the correctness of observation j to track i assignment. Then, the reasonable choice for the attribute likelihood function is LHF,j= 1 - kij The attribute likelihood function for the possibility that a given observation j originated from the false alann is computed as LHFf a,j =1 - kfa,j. Finally the attribute likelihood ratio to be used in GDA is obtained as LRa\(i, j LHFi,j/LHFf ,j 3 Fusion rules proposed for GDA-MTT Imprecise, uncertain and even contradicting information or data are characteristics of the real world situations and must be incorporated into modem MTT systems to provide a 


be incorporated into modem MTT systems to provide a complete and accurate model of the monitored problem On the other hand, the conflict and paradoxes management in collected knowledge is a major problem especially during the fusion of many information sources. Indeed the conflict increases with the number of sources or with the number of processed scans in MTT. Hence a reliable issue for processing and/or reassigning the conflicting probability masses is required. Such a situation involves also some decision-making procedures based on specific data bases to achieve proper knowledge extraction for a better understanding of the overall monitored problem. It is important and valuable to achieve hierarchical extraction of relevant information and to improve the decision accuracy such that highly accurate decisions can be made progressively. There are many valuable fusion rules in the literature to deal with imperfect information based on different mathematical models and on different methods for transferring the conflicting mass onto admissible hypotheses of the frame of the problem. DST [23, 22] was the first theory for combining uncertain information expressed as basic belief assignments with Dempster's rule. Recently, DSmT [24 was developed to overcome the limitations of DST \(mainly due to the well-known inconsistency of Dempster's rule for highly conflicting fusion problem and the limitations of the Shafer's model itself cise and possibly highly conflicting sources of information for static or dynamic fusion applications. DSmT is actually a natural extension of DST. The major differences between these two theories is on the nature of the hypotheses of the frame 0 on which are defined the basic belief assignments bba  hyper-power set \(Dedekind's lattice., i.e. the lattice closed by n and U set operators a frame assumed for simplicity to be exhaustive. Let's denote C 932 the classical power set of 0 \(if we assume Shafer's model with all exclusivity constraints between elements of 8 denote G the hyper-power set De \(if we adopt DSmT and we know that some elements can't be refined because of their intrinsic fuzzy and continuous nature assignment m  m\(0 X tween DST and DSmT lie in the model of the frame E8 one wants to deal with but also in the rules of combination to apply.

If X1 nX2 = 0, then the truth lies in X1 U X2.

The sampling period is Tsca, = 5 sec and measurement standard deviations are 0.3 deg and 120 m for azimuth and range respectively. The targets go from North to South with the following type order FCFCFCF from left to right \(F=Fighter, C=Cargo 150m/sec.They are moving in parallel with approximately 320 m inter-distance. During scans 8- 10, 17- 19, 26-28 and 34 - 36 the maneuvers are performed with transversal acceleration 3.5m/s2. Process noise standard deviations for the two nested models for constant velocity IMM are 0. lm/s2 and 3m/s2 respectively.

Monte Carlo simulations are made for the two different average values of Radar Cross Section in order to obtain the confusion matrix in terms of the first frame of hypotheses 81 ={Small, Big}. According to the fuzzy rules in 24, 27], defining the correspondence between Radar Cross Section values and the respective targets' types, the confusion matrix in tenns of the second frame of hypotheses 92 - {Fighter, Cargo} is constructed. The two simulation cases correspond to the following parameters for the probability of target detection, the probability of false alarms and the confusion matrices Case 1: Pd -1, Pfa = 0,T L0.995 0.0051fa - 1 - 0.00 99 Case 2: Pd-0.9, Pfa01. i0-5T2 0.9 0.11. Case 2 0.1 0.9j 4.2 Simulation results In this section we present and discuss simulation results for 100 Monte Carlo runs. The evaluation of fusion rules' performance is based on the criteria of tracks' purity, tracks life, the variation of pignistic entropy in confirmed tracks attribute states, the average pignistic entropy value in a steady state and percentage of miscorrelation. Tracks purity criteria examines the ratio between the number of particular performed \(observationj-track i in case of detected target ciations during the tracking scenario. Track's life is evaluated as an average number of scans before track's deletion. The tracks deletion is performed after the a priori 934 defined number \(in our case it is assumed to be 3 correct associations or missed detections. The percentage of miscorrelation examines the relative number of incorrect observation-track sults for GDA are obtained by different fusion rules. Relying on our previous work [24, 27], where the performance of DSm Classic and DSm Hybrid \(DSmH amined, in the present work the attention is directed to the well-known Dempster's rule, Yager's, Dubois &amp; Prade's and especially to DSmH and the new PCR5 rule. From results presented in Tables 1-4 in next sections, it is obvious that for both cases 1 and 2 the track's purity and tracks' life in the case of KDA-MTT are significantly lower with respect to all GDA-MTT, and a higher percentage of miscorrelaton is obtained with KDA-MTT than with GDA-MTT The figures below show typical tracking performances for KDA-MTT and GDA-MTT systems TrackingPer7formance with Kinematics Only D/ta Assoiaton  0.5 X - Position [n Fig. 2: Typical performance with KDA-MTT Fig. 3: Typical performance with GDA-MTT 4.2.1 Simulation resultsfor case 1 Case no. 1 is characterized by no false alarm and maximum probability of target detection, but the problem consists in the proximity of the targets \(inter-distance of 320 m bad sensor distance resolution \(CD = 120m cross-associations. The Monte Carlo results on track purity based on KDA-MTT and on GDA-MTT \(based on PCR5 Dempster \(DS 4Yager's rule, Dubois &amp; Prade's \(DP incide in our example because we are working with only a 2D specific classes frame e2. This is normal. In general, Yager's DP and DSmH do no longer coincide when the cardinality of the frame becomes greater than two in Table 1. Each number of the table gives the ratio of correct measurement-target association for a given target and a given MTT algorithm and the last row of the table provides the average purity performance for all targets and for each algorithm One can see that the corresponding fields for results obtained via Dempster's rule of combination are empty \(see 


tained via Dempster's rule of combination are empty \(see Tables 1-4 1. The case of increasing intrinsic conflicts between the fused bodies of evidence \(generalized basic belief assignments of targets' tracks histories and new observations situation when this conflict becomes unity, is a stressful, but a real one. It is the moment, when Dempster's rule produces indefiniteness. The fusion process stops and the attribute histories of tracking tracks cannot be updated. As a result the whole tracking process corrupts. Actually in such a case there is a need of an artificial break and intervention into the real time tracking process, which could cause noncoherent results. Taking into account all these particularities, we can summarize that the fusion process within DST is not fluent and cannot be controlled without prior unjustified and artificial assumptions and some heuristic engineering tricks. As a consequence no one of the performance criteria cannot be evaluated 2. In case when in the updated track's attribute history one of the hypotheses in the frame of the problem is supported by unity, from this point on, Dempster's rule becomes indifferent to all observations, detected during the next scans. It means, the track's attribute history remains unchanged regardless ofthe new observations. It is a dangerous situation, which hides the real opportunity for producing the non-adequate results KDA PCR5 DS Y/DP/DSmH T 0.6187 0.9650 - 0.9521 T2 0.4892 0.9150 - 0.9150 T3 0.4424 0.8300 - 0.8289 T4 0.5500 0.9084 - 0.9350 T5 0.6797 0.8861 - 0.8689 T6 0.7213 0.9561 - 0.9624 T7 0.8034 0.9863 - 0.9739 Average 0.6149 0.9209 - 0.9194 Table 1: Track's purity for KDA and GDA-MTT \(case 1 The results of the percentage of Track life duration and miscorrelation are given in Table 2.

According to the criteria of average pignistic entropy value in a steady state, one can see that the entropy associated with updated tracks' attribute states by using PCR5 rule is almost 2 times less than the entropy obtained by using all other rules. It means that PCR5 rule leads to results, which are much more informative in comparison with the other ones 4.2.2 Simulation resultsfor case 2 Case no. 2 is more difficult than case no. 1 since the presence of false alarms and missed target detections significantly degrade the process of data association even in the case of GDA.

A model of an attribute type classifier is considered on the base of particular input fuzzification interface according to the target RCS values and on fuzzy rule base according to the target type. A generalized likelihood ratio is obtained and included in the process of GDA. The classification results rely on the confusion matrix specifying the accuracy of the classifier and on the implemented fusion rules \(PCR5, Dempster's, Yager's Dubois &amp; Prade's, DSmH advantages and milestones and to improve association results. This work confirms the benefits of attribute utilization and shows some hidden drawbacks, when the sources of information remain in high conflict, especially in case of using Dempster's rule of combination. In clutter-free environment with maximum of target detection probability and very good classifier quality, the results, according to the performance criteria, obtained via PCR5 rule outperform the corresponding results obtained by using all the other combination rules tested. When tracking conditions decrease \(presence of clutter, missed target detections with 


lower classifier quality the best performances with respect to other rules tested for our new GDA-MTT algorithm. This work reveals also the real difficulty to define and to choose an unique or a multiple performance criteria for the fair evaluation of different fusion rules. Actually the choice of the fusion rule is in practice highly conditioned by the performance criteria that the system designer considers as the most important for his application.

Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART achieved a higher classification rate against this particular dataset A comparison of the knowledge representation produced by our method, PART and CBA has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the set of rules derived. Figure 4 represents the classifiers generated form the hyperheuristic datasets. Analysis of the rules sets indicated that MMAC derives a few more rules than PART and CBA for the majority of the datasets. In particular, the proposed method produced more rules than PART and CBA on 8 and 7 datasets, respectively. A possible reason for extracting more rules is based on the recursive learning phase that MMAC employs to discover more hidden information that most of the associative classification techniques discard, since they only extract the highest confidence rule for each frequent item that survives MinConf Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 6. Conclusions A new approach for multi-class, and multi-label classification has been proposed that has many distinguishing features over traditional and associative classification methods in that it \(1 that contain rules with multiple labels, \(2 evaluation measures for evaluating accuracy rate, \(3 employs a new method of discovering the rules that require only one scan over the training data, \(4 introduces a ranking technique which prunes redundant rules, and ensures only high effective ones are used for classification, and \(5 discovery and rules generation in one phase to conserve less storage and runtime. Performance studies on 19 datasets from Weka data collection and 9 hyperheuristic scheduling runs indicated that our proposed approach is effective, consistent and has a higher classification rate than the-state-of-the-art decision tree rule \(PART and RIPPER algorithms.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
