e.gambi@univpm.it Abstract\227 Today both the military and commercial sectors are placing an increased emphasis on global communications This has prompted the development of several Low Earth Orbit satellite systems that promise a worldwide connectivity and realtime voice data and video communications Constellations that avoid repeated uplink and downlink work by exploiting Inter Satellite Links have proved to be very economical in space routing However traditionally Inter Satellite Links were considered to be out of reach for any malicious activity and thus little or no security was employed This paper proposes a secured Inter Satellite Links based network built upon the adoption of the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum technique with binary de Bruijn sequences used as spreading codes Selected sequences from the de Bruijn family may be used over directional spot beams The main intent of the paper is to propose a secure and robust communication link for the next generation of

Message routing on ground may be ef\002ciently managed through several strategies available for optimizing the path between source and destination but routing in space needs a very precise calculation of path length and resource allocation Future space network architecture is envisioned to be widely distributed independent and to some degree intelligent in its operation The development of a satellite cluster system that supports an inter-satellite communication makes possible the execution of a complex communication environment designed to minimize space-ground-space communication jumps and enables Geosynchronous Earth Orbit 050GEO\051 to Low Earth Orbit 050LEO\051 and GEO to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 050UAV\051 space links The economic bene\002ts of such a network in space far outweigh the technological challenges Inter Satellite Link 050ISL\051 enhances system reliability capacity and reduces the number of gateways required By eliminating the dependency on ground in

communications virtually unaffected by terrestrial service disruptions that may be caused by earthquakes hurricanes 003oods and other natural and man-made causes Here we study the performance of the satellite cross link using de Bruijn sequences for spread spectrum transmission which can be further enhanced by deploying directional spot beam antennas on board the space nodes Two basic designs are considered the former consisting of a network of similar constellation satellites with predictable in-space trajectories and pre-determined orbits 050static constellation\051 The second model will consist of satellite networks combined with other heterogeneous space platforms like commercial and military planes UAVs etc Like a handshake in space crosslinks provide rapid ultra-secure communications by enabling the satellites to pass signals to one another while requiring only one ground station on friendly soil Some of the current satellite constellations use L-band to communicate between the space and ground terminals based on a hybrid Frequency Division Multiple Access Time Division Multiple Access 050FDMA/TDMA\051 scheme using a 90 millisecond Time Division Duplex 050TDD\051 frame Each frame is composed by 2250 symbols of channel bursts at a modulation rate of 25 kilo/symbols per second 050ksps\051 However Ka-Band and V-band are used as the operating frequency bands for in-space communications with modulation techniques as basic as Binary Phase Shift Keying 050BPSK\051 and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying 050QPSK\051 These elementary communication techniques make the space segment very vulnerable to eavesdropping and jamming by malicious entities The simulation model considers the link to operate at the currently used Ka-band 05023 GHz\051 and V-band 05060 GHz\051 Consequently the theoretical model is developed to analyze characteristics and performance of Inter-satellite links using de Bruijn sequences for spread spectrum links in satellite networks The remainder of the paper is organized as follows constellation design for the predictable and dynamic network topology is presented in Section 2 In space inter-satellite links are described in Section 3 The characteristics of de Bruijn sequences and their cardinality and correlation properties are presented in Section 4 An overall integrated system design is proposed in Section 5 and in Section 6 the simulated performance of the link are discussed 2 C ONSTELLATION D ESIGN Routing among satellites and space platforms is accomplished by relaying packets by using intermediate satellites as relays It has long been realized that the LEO satellite constellations using intersatellite links can provide global coverage 1 


Figure 1  Inter Satellite Link network in space while offering real-time communication services between end-users The communication system is affected mainly by the choice of design factors like constellation design altitude power routing method satellite cross link design etc 1 There are tw o major types of constellations polar and Walker Both constellations are designed to provide the most ef\002cient global coverage by using the minimum number of satellites and each has its own advantages and disadvantages A polar constellation provides coverage for the entire globe including the poles while a Walker constellation only covers areas below a certain latitude 050   000 70 016 051 With the same number of satellites a Walker constellation can therefore provide a higher diversity than a polar constellation The satellite constellation is made up of predetermined number of satellites in prescribed orbits to provide global coverage with minimum time delay In this paper we examine satellite cross-links with time-dependent Doppler variation keeping other parameters constant Space based platforms can be characterized in the two main categories satellites with 002xed orbit and predictable trajectory non-satellites i.e platforms with unpredictable path and dynamic trajectory Routing in Predictable Network Topology The choice of relay and cross-links has a determining effect on the performance of space based communication system affecting the time delay and the quality of service 050QoS\051 In the case of satellites the orbits and the positions are known to every member in the constellation This allows the source node to predict the neighboring nodes that can be utilized as relays Here we consider a polar orbit where all satellites are rotating in the same direction The movement of the satellites can be broken down into two segments one going from north to south and the second from south to north Among the commercial satellite systems designed or operated in time only a few were supposed to provide ISLs 017 Iridium RF ISL in the band 22.55 23.55 GHz providing 25 Mbps data rate There are 4 ISLs per satellite 2 intra plane and 2 inter plane 017 Orblink RF ISL in the band 65.0 71.0 GHz providing 15 Gbps data rate with 2 ISLs per satellite both intra plane 017 Teledesic RF ISL at 60 GHz with 155 Mbps data rate and 8 ISLs per satellite featuring permanent and dynamics links Among the systems cited above only Iridium was deployed and is currently operational Each satellite node is assumed to maintain four ISL cross links with intra plane links maintained constantly and inter plane links managed dynamically Figure 2  Geometrical model for the LEO ISL as the satellite transcends its orbital path In the case of Iridium constellation nodes located in planes 1 and 6 can maintain only three connections two of which are intra plane The nodes in the boundary planes do not establish cross links between each other due to rapid angular velocity changes that occur between satellites in counter rotating planes The satellites are considered to be in six orbital planes separated by 31.6 degree at an altitude of 780km 050LEO\051 and 86.4 degree inclination Due to the inherent nature of the cross links they can be modeled as time varying in a deterministic manner depending on the relative motion of the satellites Here we consider the time varying free space loss contribution as one of the signi\002cant parameter affecting the link performance For cross links between two satellites in a LEO orbit it is reasonable to consider a 003at Earth model to simulate in space routing as shown in Fig 2 From such a model the position of satellite in Cartesian coordinate system can be given as 050 x 1 050 t 051  y 1 050 t 051\051  050 v 1 001 tcos\022 1  v 1 001 tsin\022 1 051 0501\051 050 x 2 050 t 051  y 2 050 t 051\051  050 v 2 001 050 t 000 t 0 051 cos\022 2  v 2 001 050 t 000 t 0 051 sin\022 2 051 0502\051 where t 0 is the time taken by the second satellite to cross the track of the 002rst satellite In the model 001 h is assumed to be the vertical 050 z axis\051 separation between the satellites As a result the ISL distance is given by L 050 t 051  p  050 x 2 000 x 1 051 2  050 y 2 000 y 1 051 2  050 z 2 000 z 1 051 2 0503\051 From previous equations the above de\002nition can be expressed as L 2 050 t 051  t 2  v 2 1  v 2 2  2 v 1 001 v 2 001 cos 050 022 1 000 022 2    2 v 2 t 0 t  v 1 001 cos 050 022 1 000 022 2 051 000 v 2   v 2 2 t 2 0  001 h 2 Since the ISL is time varying the ISL distance dependency on time can be given as a reduced form of the previous equation L 2 050 t 051  a L t 2  b L t  c L 0504\051 Thus the received signal power on the ISL cross link can be said to be P R 050 t 051  000 EIRP 001 G R L 2 050 t 051 001 001 050 025 4 031 051 2  which can be further generalized for Free Space Path Loss 050FSPL\051 as F SP L 050 t 051 dB  32  44  20 log 10 L 050 t 051 km  20 log 10 f M Hz  where due to the time varying nature of the cross link even the EIRP could be considered time dependent as well Routing in Dynamic Network Topology The cross link works well if the receiver is in the 3dB cone width of the transmitted beam but as the node travels towards 2 


Figure 3  Spot beam coverage and overlapping region for handoff the edge of the cone there is signi\002cant signal deterioration due to delay and Doppler phenomenon To enable a connection between nodes with dynamic path and irregular trajectory a search needs to be done for periods during which the variation in azimuth over time is small To 002nd these periods of small variations derivatives of azimuth angles are computed These are the optimal time periods for establishing a cross-link between the satellite and an independent node Since the direction of travel of the node relative to satellite plays a signi\002cant role in affecting the link quality a soft handoff scheme should be in place to ensure a seamless end-to-end data transfer as shown in Fig 3 The geometry of such network will need to have overlapping coverage regions GEO or MEO backbone architecture would be more suitable than LEO network A system with backbone can be expressed as a function of coverage and number of apertures available for cross-link a j   u  v 040 Z c j 1  i dV  0505\051 where a j is the number of apertures that backbone satellite j must carry c j is j s coverage region i is the level of coverage experienced by dV  u is the total number of user nodes and v is the total volume of space of possible user locations The technical details of this type of topology are beyond the scope of this paper however the de Bruijn sequences proposed in the next section can be implemented on any cross-links irrespective of the topology 3 I NTER S ATELLITE L INK Inter-satellite link is the network architecture that was 002rst successfully employed by Motorola in the form of Iridium satellite network In the network with ISL capability the satellites can talk not only to the ground station and gateways but also to each other forming a network in space When a signal is up-linked to a satellite the information is passed through the network of satellites to the one that is immediately over the destination gateway This scheme allows nodes to talk to each other without ever referencing to any ground stations at all thereby reducing signal latency that can adversely affect time-sensitive protocols such as TCP/IP In this paper the model assumes that satellites in the constellation travel in straight lines with a given height difference and trajectories as illustrated in Fig 1 The 002rst satellite crosses the track of the second satellite at time t  0 which results in the local coordinate system shown in Fig 2 ISLs are links established between satellites in the same plane 050intra-plane\051 and between satellites in adjacent planes 050interplane\051 Intra-plane links are maintained permanently with each satellite having forward and backward connectivity with the satellites directly in front and behind Inter-plane links are dynamically established and terminated as the satellite transcends its orbital path Except for the satellites in counterrotating planes one and six each satellite has four ISLs The satellites located within planes one and six maintain only three ISLs each two of which are intra-plane The horizontal pointing angle between two satellites in adjacent orbital planes using a reference of zero degrees parallel to the equator varies by approximately 006 65 degrees over one orbital period This angle varies most slowly over the equator where satellites in adjacent orbits are the most separated and it varies most rapidly over the poles where the orbits cross A nominal horizontal azimuth of 006 45 to 50 degrees with an antenna steerable over a 30 to 45 degree range is suf\002cient to maintain inter-orbital links between latitudes of 50 to 60 degrees north and south Ef\002cient link assignment and routing algorithms can optimize network delay and decrease overhead 4 D E B RUIJN S EQUENCES Binary de Bruijn sequences are a special class of nonlinear shift register sequences with maximal period N  2 n  n is called the span of the sequence i.e the sequence may be generated by an n stage shift register In the binary case the total number of distinct sequences of span n is 2 2 050 n 000 1\051 000 n  in the more general case of span n sequences over an alphabet of cardinality 013  the number of distinct sequences is 013  013 050 n 000 1\051 013 n  In this paper we refer to binary de Bruijn sequences The states f S 0  S 1      S N 000 1 g of a span n de Bruijn sequence are exactly all the possible 2 n different binary n tuples when viewed cyclically a de Bruijn sequence of length 2 n contains each binary n tuple exactly once over a period even the all-zero n tuple This is the reason why de Bruijn binary sequences may not be generated by means of classical and well-known Linear Feedback Shift Registers 050LFSR\051 Cardinality and generation issues The length of a de Bruijn sequence 050i.e a maximal length sequence\051 is always an even number To compare the total number of de Bruijn sequences of length N and the total number of available m-sequences or Gold sequences at a parity of n  similar but not identical length values shall be considered As an example for a value of the span n equal to 7 050i.e binary sequences of length 128\051 there are 2 57 different sequences if n increases up to 10 the number of sequences grows up to 2 502  The huge cardinality of the de Bruijn sequences set makes the task of identifying a speci\002c sequence extremely complex to execute also depending on the speci\002c application Pseudorandom numbers and generators are used in a wide set of applications such as the generation of spreading codes for Code Division Multiple Access schemes 050CDMA\051 and cryptography One of the most adopted technique for generating pseudorandom numbers relies on LFSRs as they permit an ef\002cient implementation of a deterministic random behavior A single LFSR allows one to generate msequences two LFSRs may be adopted to generate Gold and Kasami sequences also useful in CDMA However the main drawback in LFSRs is the predictability of the output 3

linear feedback part is generalized to a nonlinear behavior NFSRs may generate maximum length sequences 050as de Bruijn ones\051 that can even be used to design binary sequences with negative autocorrelation values for asynchronous Direct Sequence 050DS\051 CDMA as discussed in  Binary NFSR sequences may be generated by 2-v alue nonlinear feedback shift register with n memory cells as

cross-correlation properties of the sequences affect the selection of the spreading codes to use The former affects the effectiveness of the single-user information extraction process whereas the latter in\003uences the global performance of the multiuser communication system in terms of Multiple User Interference 050MUI\051 The autocorrelation 022 050 k 051 of a binary de Bruijn sequence c

for k  0  0 for 1 024 j k j 024 n 000 1 and 022 050 k 051 6  0  for j k j  n  As long as the span of the sequence increases the amount of values k for which the autocorrelation sidelobes 050i.e the values assumed by 022 050 k 051 for k 6  0 051 are zero also increases It is also known that 022 050 k 051 021 0 mod 4  for all k  for any binary sequence of period N  2 n  with n 025 2  In a binary de Bruijn sequence the number of 1's equals the number of 0's Figure 5  Average normalized auto-correlation pro\002le of span 5 binary de Bruijn sequences as a consequence any binary de Bruijn sequence in a bipolar form has a null average autocorrelation Fig 5 shows the average normalized autocorrelation pro\002le computed over all the 2048 binary de Bruijn sequences of length 32 With the exception of the peak value at k  0  the autocorrelation pro\002le is symmetric with respect to the central value of the shift k  16  A general property states that 022 050 k 051  022 050 N 000 k 051  for 0 024 k 024 N 000 1  As n increases the autocorrelation pro\002les of the de Bruijn sequences will show many samples equal to 0 a symmetric distribution of the samples and a reduced number of different positive and negative samples as to give an average autocorrelation equal to 0 The autocorrelation pro\002les of all the 2048 binary de Bruijn sequences of length 32 shown in Fig 6 050peaks

important feature to improve the detection capability of the autocorrelation peak i.e the matched 002ltering of the received sequence As per the cross-correlation function of a pair of de Bruijn sequences a and b 050 a 6  b 051 of the same span n and length N  the following bound holds 000 2 n 024 r ab 050 k 051 024 2 n 000 4  for 0 024 k 024 N 000 1  where r ab 050 k 051  P N 000 1 i 0 a i b i  k denotes the cross-correlation between the two sequences Complementary de Bruijn sequences c and 026 c provide a null shift cross-correlation r c 026 c 0500\051  000 2 n  that motivates the lower bound on the cross-correlation pro\002le To avoid this negative peak value only half of the sequences in the set should be considered by taking just one sequence in each couple 050 c  026 c 051 The cross-correlation function of binary de Bruijn sequences shows symmetry properties similar to those exhibited by the autocorrelation function All the possible cross-correlation values are integer multiples of 4 If de Bruijn sequences are compared to sequences generated by LFSR it is well known that m sequences generated by using maximal length LFSR provide an 223ideal\224 two-valued auto-correlation function which is maximal 050 N 051 in the dc term and equal to 000 1 N for all the other terms Gold sequences are obtained by combining two m sequences of length N  2 n 000 1 050 n being the span of the register\051 from a set of so-called 223preferred\224 m sequences Gold sequences 4 


Figure 6  Autocorrelation pro\002les of the full set of binary de Bruijn sequences of length 32 050peaks removed\051 exhibit a three-valued cross-correlation function with values f\000 1  000 t 050 n 051  t 050 n 051 000 2 g  where t 050 n 051 is equal to t 050 n 051  2 n 1  2 0506\051 for odd n  and t 050 n 051  2 n 2  2 0507\051 for even n  The auto-correlation function of Gold sequences is also a three-valued function with values f N 000 t 050 n 051  t 050 n 051 000 2 g  De Bruijn sequences exhibit a satisfactory behavior in terms of correlation properties exploited for code acquisition at the receiver especially if compared to the Gold ones for k 6  0  the normalized auto-correlation values are on average smaller than those assumed by the Gold sequences thus allowing a better detection of the auto-correlation peak Security-related properties In the speci\002c case of application discussed by this paper we are interested in spreading information signals in order to provide physical layer protection of the transmitted information As a consequence besides the correlation properties discussed above it is also necessary to look at the securityrelated features of de Bruijn sequences selected as spreading codes First it is expected that the spreading codes adopted will exhibit a satisfactory degree of randomness in order to provide the information signals with enough robustness to deter possible jammers or eavesdroppers In order to design good Pseudo Random Sequence Generators 050PRSGs\051 in cryptographic practice several randomness criteria have been proposed Shannon's basic work demonstrated the onetime-pad scheme is unbreakable by resorting to information theory concepts However the ideal one-time-pad scheme is impractical in real systems Hence a good PRSG should resemble as much as possible the one-time-pad scheme and generate pseudorandom sequences with large periods to guarantee that different messages are encrypted using different key streams In the mid 1950s Golomb proposed the well-known three randomness postulates i.e R 1 050the balance property\051 R-2 050the run property\051 and R-3 050the ideal 2-level autocorrelation\051 the ideal n tuple distribution was also introduced as a further criterion By the end of the 1960s Berlekamp presented a decoding algorithm to reconstruct an entire codeword from the knowledge of a Table 1  Length and

known as the linear span or linear complexity of the sequence is equal to n  then from any known consecutive 2 n bits the full period of the sequence can be reconstructed This result imposed the application of the large linear span criterion to PRSGs  an y pseudorandom sequence used in stream ciphers keystream generators or pseudorandom number generators should have large linear spans in order to minimize their predictability According to this criterion de Bruijn sequences are attractive since their linear complexity C can be bounded as follows 2 n 000 1  n 024 C 024 2 n 000 1 0508\051 where both the lower bound and upper bound are achievable Every de Bruijn sequence of span n is balanced and exhibits the run property but it does not provide the 2-level autocorrelation pro\002le The properties introduced above demonstrate the suitability of selecting binary de Bruijn sequences as spreading codes even if the 2-level autocorrelation postulate is not satis\002ed as the primary intended use of the sequences is not for cryptographic PRSG implementation Values reported in Table 1 con\002rm the exponential growth in the number of de Bruijn sequences with respect to other possible sets This speci\002c feature of de Bruijn sequences has made them attractive for use in the security 002eld assuming one adopts a binary de Bruijn sequence of span n as a spreading code or a cryptographic key even in the case an opponent is able to understand how long the sequence is it will be very dif\002cult for him to locate the exact sequence in use at least for values of n greater than 6 Sequences that exhibit a two-valued auto-correlation function and low cross-correlation values are usually targeted to spread spectrum for multiple users communications spreading for the purpose of information hiding and protection may require different properties such as a remarkable linear span of the sequences and a huge number of possible sequences to use in order to avoid brute-force attacks In this perspective de Bruijn sequences can represent a valid alternative to classical m sequences and Gold codes that have been historically proposed for the former set of applications On the other hand the generation of de Bruijn sequences shows increased complexity and this feature must be accounted for in the overall system design cost 5 


5 S YSTEM D ESIGN In order to model the ISL and obtain some preliminary evaluations about the possible effective adoption of binary de Bruijn sequences as spreading codes for the DS-SS physical layer some assumptions are made to simplify the scenario under evaluation First it is assumed that the ISL is affected by a random noise contribution that includes several effects due to sky noise and possibly by a jamming signal due to an adversary satellite that is passing near to the ISL and tries to disrupt its transmissions At this stage of the study Doppler effects due to the relative movements of the satellites communicating on the ISL are neglected As a matter of fact when considering intra-satellite ISLs the satellites involved in communications on the ISL are assumed to travel at the same speed along the same trajectory but at different locations so their relative velocity is 030  0  Doppler effects may become signi\002cant when considering inter-satellite ISLs among satellites traveling along different trajectories and featuring variable relative velocities As a second issue a single channel is supposed to be active on a single ISL This means the effects due to binary de Bruijn spreading codes are considered by looking at the way they affect the spreading of the information signal with respect to other sets of sequences The auto-correlation features of the spreading codes play the major role in determining how effectively it is possible to recover the useful signal from the noisy channel When extending the scenario to the case of several channels on the same ISL the multi user interference effects shall be taken into account by considering also the cross-correlation properties of the codes In this sense the selection criteria applied to a set of spreading codes should also consider the cross-correlation minimization in order to make the different channels robust against interference due to the other channels active at the same time on the same ISL The condition for no inter-user interference is that the binary sequences assigned to the users in the system are orthogonal i.e it is veri\002ed if and only if D x 050 j 051  x 050 i 051 E

possible only in the case the number of users M 024 N  since there can be at most N orthogonal non-zero sequences of length N  When M  N  the condition holds if and only if the N 002 N matrix having x 0501\051  x 0502\051      x 050 M 051 as rows is a Hadamard matrix Except for trivial cases 050 N 1 N 2\051 Hadamard matrices exist only when N is divisible by 4 they are known to exist whenever N is a power of 2 As a consequence if N  32 050i.e 2 5 051 is considered for de Bruijn sequences we could 002nd a Hadamard matrix including those 32 sequences for which the inter-user interference is zero There is a great number of orthogonal sequences for each sequence in the binary de Bruijn family of span 5 even still in order to 002nd an optimal set of sequences for an M user system we should 002nd at least M sequences that are pairwise orthogonal over the whole set i.e if c j is orthogonal to c r  and c r is orthogonal to c t  then it should also be c j orthogonal to c t  with j 6  r 6  t  The

has been implemented in software to obtain preliminary evaluations of the proposed DS-SS ISL based on the adoption of de Bruijn sequences as spreading codes In this work the focus is on comparing the behavior of the system using de Bruijn sequences to a classical implementation adopting Gold binary sequences as spreading codes 050as in CDMA\051 To this aim in order to limit the computational burdens due to simulating the real parameters expected on an ISL 050like a 23 GHz carrier frequency or a 1 Mbps data rate\051 a scaled version of the parameters has been assumed An information rate of 1 kbps 050 T b  1 ms 051 is considered whereas the chip rate amounts to 32 kchip/s 050 T c  31  25 026s 051 when de Bruijn spreading sequences are applied and to 31 kchip/s 050 T c 030  32  25 026s 051 when Gold sequences are selected The carrier frequency is set equal to f c  50 kHz  and a BPSK modulated jammer signal is assumed to be located at a frequency offset of 5000 Hz from the carrier frequency The simulator generates both random noise and a jamming signal The amplitude of random noise and the jamming signal is set relative to the strength of the transmitted signal 050which is set to 1\051 For example a value of 2 for the parameter a related to the jamming signal amplitude means the power of the jamming signal is twice as strong as the desired transmitted signal at the receiver For the random noise contribution it is requested to specify the value assigned to a parameter called var  to which the random noise samples are related according to rnd  noise  p  var 001 rand 050 S 051  being S the number of samples necessary to simulate the QPSK modulation of the signal Two conditions are simulated the former uses binary Gold sequences of length 31 as spreading codes the latter applies binary de Bruijn sequences of length 32 They are compared at a parity of the random noise contribution 050 0  1 024 var 024 1 051 and jamming signal component 050 0  1 024 a 024 8 051 with respect to the bit error rate evaluated on the despread received signal The results obtained are shown in Table 2 The difference in the spreading gain due to the different length of the sequences 05031 and 32 bits\051 has been accounted for within the simulation runs Apart from the numerical values obtained that may not be related to a practical ISL due to the assumptions detailed above it is interesting to observe how the application of de Bruijn spreading codes in general gives slightly better performance than Gold codes When both the random noise contribution and jammer component take the maximum value admitted the BER obtained by de Bruijn sequences is lower than the one provided by Gold codes A further comment that may be provided about these results is related to the limited length of the spreading codes considered in simulations As shown by previous Table 1 when n increases the cardinality 6 


Figure 7  Upper and lower bounds of the linear span of binary de Bruijn sequences compared to Gold sequences of span 3 024 n 024 10 of de Bruijn sequence set almost explodes It is reasonable to assume that the longer the sequences used the more the spreading signals will show a noise-like behavior which makes them more robust against random noise and jammer components For increasing values of the span n  the behavior of de Bruijn sequences with respect to randomness and correlation properties becomes more favourable than that of Gold codes both because of the much greater cardinality of the set and thanks to the fact that de Bruijn sequences become more and more piecewise orthogonal It means that when n increases it is possible to 002nd several values of the shift parameter k for which the cross-correlation between two de Bruijn sequences is zero thus improving the single code acquisition at the receiver In huge sets of sequences it is also possible to apply selection criteria in order to choose only sequences that most exhibit a random-like behavior From a security perspective the behavior of the linear complexity bounds of de Bruijn sequences 050Eq 8\051 for different values of the span n  is shown in Fig 7 The much lower value of the linear span of Gold sequences is also shown for comparison Any de Bruijn sequence has a large linear span the normalized linear span of a de Bruijn sequence is always  1  2 050for a sequence of period r and linear span C  the normalized linear span is de\002ned by C  r 051 any de Bruijn sequence satis\002es the span n property The results herein discussed suggest the feasibility of applying de Bruijn sequences as spreading codes not only thanks to their impressive linear complexity 050which is a basic parameter with respect to security\051 but also because they may provide satisfactory results even under the point of view of error performance As a 002nal remark Fig 8 shows a graphical sketch of the received spread signals affected by random noise and jamming in the case of de Bruijn and Gold spreading corresponding to the condition of maximum amplitude of the random noise and jammimg interference It is possible to say that the frequency spectrum pro\002les of the received signals are almost totally superimposed and do not provide any insight about the speci\002c code used to spread the information 7 C ONCLUSION In this paper a satellite constellation with inter-satellite links for routing among predictable and dynamic nodes is evaluFigure 8  Received QPSK spread signals de Bruijn 050dark line\051 and Gold 050light line\051 spread codes ated in the presence of malicious nodes in space Security is provided at the physical layer through Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum modulation by using a family of binary de Bruijn sequences as spreading codes It is shown that binary de Bruijn sequences a special class of nonlinear shift register sequences can be optimized to perform similarly as Gold codes and exhibit a satisfactory degree of randomness in order to provide the information signals with enough robustness against possible jammers or eavesdroppers Comparison among the two sequence sets shows that the use of de Bruijn sequences makes observation much more computationally exhaustive and time-consuming than Gold codes for an undesirable receiver This characteristic of the proposed sequence set is supposed to act as a deterrent for eavesdropping and jamming activity to extract information in real-time The proposed scheme is presented as an effort to secure information in space networks and to meet an increasing demand for high reliability and security against malicious activities in space routing R EFERENCES   B Gavish J Kalvenes 224The Impact of InterSatellite Communication Links on LEOS Performance\224 Telecommunication System Journal   C Sacchi G Gera C Regazzoni 224W-band Physical Layer Design Issues in the Context of the DAVID-DCE Experiment,\224 Int Journal of Satellite Communications and Networking Vol 22 No 2 March-Apr 2004 pp 193-215   Williams G Cowley 224Performance Comparisons for Adaptive LEO Satellite Links\224 Int'l Journal of Satellite Communications and Networking 2006 24:229-239   Ma J Lu R 224The Study on RF Inter-Satellite Links\224 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications Networking and Mobile Computing 050WiCOM\051 2011 Page\050s\051 1 4   H Keller et.al 224Examination of the Circular Polar Satellite Constellation for the Use of Inter-Satellite Links\224 ICPWC 1997   S R Pratt et.al 224An Operational and Performance Overview of the Iridium Low Earth Orbit Satellite System\224 IEEE Communication Surveys 1999   N De Bruijn 224A combinatorial problem,\224 Proc Neder7

the one dimensional le We also describe a means of efìciently handling cells that may occur at the edge of the split We implement a caching mechanism that prefetches data by taking advantage of prior knowledge of the userês access pattern and leads to signiìcant gains in performance An obvious avenue for future work is to explore the effect of ordering partitions using a space lling curve rather than the linear order we currently use Though this organization will be slower for some types of iteration we expect that it will yield acceptable performance in all cases perhaps making it a good default choice for organizing the partitions Our current implementation assumes that the data resides locally but we expect to extend the system to handle remote datasets that span several geographically distributed machines Having prior information about the performance of remote servers may allow the partitioning mechanism to improve load balancing Correspondingly we would like to extend our replica location and selection mechanisms 29 28 to handle very large distributed unstructured spatial datasets The work described here will be instrumental in these future efforts VIII A

 Fig. 10. Complementarity Analysis forSMTCL and Dalian Guangyang  V. CONCLUSIONS  This paper provides a method based on text mining of patents to help extract technology intelligence to facilitate M&A. We take the NCS industry as an example. NCS is the most important part of numerical machine tools. The paper follows a technology forecasting approach and outlines a technology synergy analysis based on a multi-term Boolean search to distinguish NCS records This study has a few limitations. Some doubt remains regarding the reliability of patent data. Sometimes patent data cannot reflect the core techno logy of a company because some patent-based indicators could be obscured by strategic behavior; that is, sometimes an emerging technology is not yet permitted for patenting. Another limitation is that the latest patent data we studied are2 years old because of the 18-month patent application period. In the meantime, some changes in NCS-related technology may well have occurred Within these limitations, the paper sought to forecast developmental trends for key candidate technologies, and based on the technology trends revealed, look for technology acquisition candidates for a certain company  The technology forecasting results suggest that NCS has become a global research hotspot in the field of machine tools in recent years, and patents have reached increased significance in corporate activity. The analysis of country-topic correlation leads us to conclude that there are two research clusters in the wo rld, one centered in Japan and the USA, the other centered on Germany. While China is geographically far away from th e other countries, it has only a faint relationship with Japan and Taiwan; in this relationship the key words are ìcontrol,îìsignalî and compatibility,î which are differe nt from other countries and do not represent NCS core technology. In addition publication keywords correlation analysis also indicates that control system is a current research hotspot and focus  We then examine the top patent applicants and top publication institutions. As shown, the top patent applicants are mainly Japanese and German corporations, while top publication institutions mainly come from China and the USA. This divergence is logical since the nature of patents and publications is different in that patents focus on applications whereas literature researches theories and methods At the same time, we find that Japanese corporations are powerful in the NCS machine tool industry. Hence we choose the companies FANUC and MITS UBISHI as study targets Comparing SMTCL with them, based on IPC analysis, we observe that G05B19 is the main weaknessóincidentally this is a part of the NCS core technology Looking at SMTCLís M&A history shows us that M&A did increase their patent portfolio and business income. We also learn that SMTCL is be hind the leading NCS-related companies in patenting, although itís number 1among machine tool enterprises in the world. To make up for its weaknesses, we search for some technology acquisition candidates for SMTCL. We first download all patents related to the technology where SMTCL is lacking. Then we develop a patent filter to select a list of companies as potential targets We analyze the targetsí respective patent portfolios, filtering out all but 3 companies. Finally, we measure the technology synergy among the 3 companies, and analyze the similarity and complementarity between the targets and SMTCL In conclusion, we have grasped the development trends of some candidate technologies by patent data and find the disadvantages of SMTCL. To compensate for the disadvantages, we look for technology candidates for SMTCL M&A. In this paper, we have measured the knowledge relatedness to judge the matching degree between SMTCL and the candidates using patent data, whereas we havenít done due diligence to make sure the core researchers still work for the target company.

attention on due diligence in considering an actual acquisition. In addition, there are many other factors besides technologies to consider for M&A. Future research might well investigate historical patterns of technological, business and financial factors together as predictors of M&A success  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research was undertaken at Georgia Tech and Beijing Institute of Technology drawi ng on support from the National Science Foundation \(NSF\hrough the Science of Science Policy Program ñ ìMeasuring and Tracking Research Knowledge Integrationî \(G eorgia Tech; Award No 0830207\d the National Science Foundation of China Young Funds \(Beijing Institute of Technology; Award No 71103015\.

As the thickest shielding studied in this work is 10 cm, it follows then that the lower energies of the incident trapped proton spectra are most affected Additionally, although the incident trapped proton spectra reach energies of up to approximately 600 MeV, the majority of the spectra are dominated by low energy protons and are thus strongly attenuated by the shielding Essentially, the increased shielding thickness has the effect of hardening the incident proton flux distribution. This result also helps explain the significant localized shielding dependencies observed in the TR model development Comparatively, the GCR spectrum includes heavy ions that reach well above GeV energies. Consequently, GCR ions can undergo spallation and fragmentation with the aluminum shielding resulting in the ejection of large amounts of nucleons and lighter ions. All these secondary particles will have energies lower than the primary incident ions but that are still quite large. In addition to this is the sheer abundance of heavy ions present in the primary and secondary flux distributions. With increasing wall thicknesses, the likelihood of spallation, fragmentation, and other resonance effects increases as well. These processes favor the increase in proton and alpha particle fluxes at low energies with thicker shielding. Above the transition points the various flux distributions decrease with increasing wall thickness suggesting they are populated by a combination of high-energy incident protons and alpha particles that penetrate through the shielding as well as heavy ions that release secondary protons and alpha particles. These fluxes will fall off, however, with the shielding thickness as the likelihood of penetration decreases Overall, when the GCR- and TR-induced distributions are summed together, the neutron component and proton component dominate the flux distribution at low energies At higher energies, the protons represent the dominant contributor to the total dose. Furthermore, at very high energies, alpha particles start to become more dominant than neutrons and their abundance becomes comparable to that of the protons. Table 6 and Table 7 detail the calculated ambient dose equivalent rates, effective dose equivalent rates and E/H  10\ios for trapped protons and GCR ions at solar maximum and minimum conditions, and for the four wall thicknesses As is detailed in Table 6, the simulated TR-induced daily ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates decrease with increasing wall thickness. The simulated values are also smaller at solar maximum conditions relative to solar minimum as expected. Next, it is useful to benchmark the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates against the TEPC dose equivalent measurements collected in 2000 and 2009 to verify the assumption that H TEPC  is approximately H  10\d moreover, to verify that the first order approximation provided by Eq. \(9\ is reasonable. The year 2000 coincides with solar maximum conditions and during this time, the ISS orbited at an altitude of 372 km to 396 km. In contrast, the year 2009 represents solar minimum conditions and the ISS orbited at an altitude of 340 km to 380 km. The measured TEPC daily dose equivalent rates at the location of Service Module Panel 327 SM-327\ged between 0.15 \226 0.2 mSv d 1 in 2000 and 0.2 \226 0.3 mSv d 1 in 2009. Comparatively, for solar maximum conditions, the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates were found to be as low as 0.094 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2  to as high as 0.42 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 hese simulated values are within a factor of two of the measured values Similarly, at solar minimum conditions, the simulated results ranged from 0.14 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 wall thickness\ 0.85 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 wall thickness\hich 


14   are again within the range of measured results, though the thinnest shielding results in a slightly more conservative estimate that is within a factor of 3. It is thus noted that a change in wall thickness does have a significant influence on the TR-induced doses. While it is unclear which of the results best approximates the ISS shielding, it is argued that the upper and lower limits of the shielding thicknesses used provide representative limits of the expected dose The simulated TR-induced effective dose equivalent rate determined by Sato et al 53 a t so l a r  mi ni mu m c o nd i t i o n s   for a wall thickness of 5.56 cm \(15 g cm 2 uminum, was estimated to be 0.144 mSv d 1 In that study, fluence-toeffective dose equivalent conversion factors for all heavy ions were used. To compare, at 10.8 g cm 2 in our study the simulated effective dose equivalent was determined to be 0.187 mSv d 1 For a wall thickness of 16.2 g cm 2 the effective dose equivalent rate was determined to be 0.127 mSv d 1 These simulated values are in good agreement with the values presented by Sato et al  d i n di cat e s t h at  the majority of the effective dose equivalent due to TR exposure is reasonably estimated considering only the neutron, proton, and alpha particle contributions. The simulated ratios of E  H  10\uctuate from 0.41 up to 0.51 for solar maximum conditions and 0.35 to 0.48 for solar minimum conditions. This ratio also appears to fall off with decreasing wall thickness. Overall, the latter results suggest that for TR exposures, the TEPC measured ambient dose equivalent offers a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent Unlike the daily TR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates, the predicted GCR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates increase with increasing wall thickness Table 7\This results due to the increased neutron, proton and alpha particle flux distributions at low energies. As expected, the daily ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose equivalent rates are again smaller at solar maximum conditions as compared to solar minimum conditions. The measured GCR dose equivalent values in 2000 and 2009 are on the order of 300 to 400 \265Sv d 1 and 400 to 500 \265Sv d 1 respectively. In comparison, the simulated values range from 60 \265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 8 265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar maximum conditions and 100 265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 o 206 \265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar minimum conditions. These predicted values underestimate the measured ones by more than a factor of two. This can be attributed to the exclusion of the heavy-ion contributions Moreover, these results also suggest that as an operational quantity, the ambient dose equivalent is not well suited for high-energy heavy ions. This observation has also been previously suggested by Pelliccioni h o i n di cat ed t h a t  a depth greater than 10 mm would be more appropriate for higher-energy radiation and that no single depth is appropriate for all heavy ions Sato et al  o calcu late d th e eff ect iv e dos e equiv ale nt rate from GCR exposures \(including heavy ions\for a wall thickness of 15.0 g cm 2 Al to be 0.21 mSv d 1 At solar minimum conditions, the simulated effective dose equivalent rates in this study are found to be 0.13 mSv d 1  and 0.15 mSv d 1 for wall thicknesses of 10.8 g cm 2 and 16.2 g cm 2 respectively. As was the case earlier, there is again a slight discrepancy regards to those published by Sato et al 53 attrib u t ed to th e ex clu s io n o f th e h e a v y io n s   It was shown by Sato [53 th at th e co n t rib u tio n to t h e cumulative effective dose equivalent from both iron nuclei and pions are each nearly as much as the contribution alpha particles. Despite these underestimations, from the current simulations the ratios of effective-to-ambient dose equivalent are relatively constant between solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Furthermore, unlike TR exposures, the ratios decrease from 1.19 to 0.84 with increasing shielding thickness. These results suggest that the ambient dose equivalent is roughly a 1:1 estimate of the effective dose equivalent for GCR exposures, depending on which wall thickness is assumed. However, it is again noted that the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates are underestimated so these ratios should fall below one These latter conclusions can also be verified in another manner. The total effective dose equivalent estimated by Sato et al 53 in sid e th e ISS at so lar m i n i m u m co n d itio n s   was determined to be 0.37 mSv d 1 The total dose equivalent from TR and GCR exposures measured with the TEPC at SM-327 during solar minimum conditions \(2009 is approximately 0.6 \226 0.8 mSv d 1 The ratio of the effective dose equivalent predicted by Sato to these measured TEPC values results in an effective-to-TEPC dose equivalent conversion factor of E  H TEPC of 0.5 to 0.6. This again shows that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent and can be used as an appropriate surrogate protection quantity. This conclusion is applicable to solar maximum conditions as it was shown in the simulation results that for TR exposures the E  H  10\ios are only slightly higher at solar maximum conditions and essentially remain unchanged for GCR exposures from solar maximum to solar minimum 4.6 \226 Complex Geometry Results The above transport simulations at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2 were repeated using the complex geometry shown in Figure 16. Rather than determining the flux inside the entire SM, the flux distribution within the crew quarter \(SM-CQ was examined only. This area best approximates the location of SM-327. When compared to the simple cylinder simulations, the complex geometry is shown to have no effect on the simulated E  H  10\version ratios but does influence the observed ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates. The simulated values for trapped exposures are largely unchanged while for GCR exposures, the complex geometry results in a factor of two increase due to the build-up effect. Specifically, at a wall thickness of 5.4 g cm 2 the simulated ambient and effective 


15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
