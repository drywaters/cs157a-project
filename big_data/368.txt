TimeSleuth:  A Tool for Discoveri ng Causal and Temporal Rules Kamran Karimi and Howard J. Hamilton Department of Computer Science University of Regina Regina, Saskatchewan Canada S4S 0A2 karimi, hamilton}@cs.uregina.ca Abstract Discovering causal and temporal relations in a system is essential to understanding how it works, and to learning to control the behaviour of the system TimeSleuth is a causality miner that uses association relations as the basis for the discovery of causal and temporal relations. It does so by introducing time into the observed data. TimeSleuth uses C4.5 as its association discoverer, and by using a series of pre 
processing and post-processing techniques to enable the user to try different scenarios for mining causality. The data to be mined should originate sequentially from a single system. TimeSleuth's use of a standard decision tree builder such as C4.5 puts it outside the current mainstream method of discovering causality, which is independencies and causal Bayesian Networks. This paper introduces TimeSleuth as a tool, and describes its functionality. TimeSleuth expands the abilities of C4.5 in some important ways. It is an unsupervised tool that can handle and interpret temporal data. It also helps the user in analyzing the 
relationships among the attributes by enabling him/her to see the rules, and statistics about them, in tabular form. There is also a mechanism to distinguish between causality and acausal relations. The user is thus encouraged to perform exper iments and discover the nature of relationships among the data 1. Introduction Knowing the causal relations between the input and output of a system allows us to predict the behaviour of that system, and if any of the inputs can be manipulated then we may be able to control the system so as to have a desired output. Causality mining has been a source of extensive \(sometimes philosophical\ debate [3, 9, 16  
The question of whether we should use the term temporal rule" or use "causal rule" is thus subject to discussion. We assume that what we observe in a system is a series of attributes ta king on different values over time. Thus we only observe associations among the values of the attributes. Whether or not a temporal association portrays a causal or acausal relationship is not always obvious, hence the preference of some people to use the term "temporal rule" instead of "causal rule Some researchers claim that under certain conditions causal relations can be discovered reliably [12  T h e t ool introduced in this paper uses the direction of time to distinguish between causal and acausal relations, with causal relations assumed to flow forward in time, and 
acausal relations assumed to flow backward. We define a temporal relation to be either causal or acausal, as long as the attributes involved in the relation appear at different times Many different methods have been employed to discover temporal rules and patterns.  An event sequence is a series of temporally ordered events, with either an ordinal time variable \(which gives the order but not a real-valued time\no time variable.  Each event specifies the values for a set of attributes. A pattern in an event sequence is called a e 1 Algorithms such as Dyna mic Time Warping and its variants measure the similarity of patterns that are stretched differently over time   Thes e m e t hods ha ve 
not been applied to searching for relations in causal data Interpreting association relations as causal relations requires justification. Th e current trend in causality mining involves using the statistical concept of conditional independence as a measure of the control one attribute may have over another. For example, given the three attributes x  y and z if x and y are independent given z that is P  x  y  z  P  x  z 
hen we can conclude that x is not a direct cause of y and y is not a direct cause of x In other words z separates x and y from each other. This basic concept is used in Bayesian Networks to build graphs that show the conditional dependence of the attributes under observation. This graph is then interpreted as signifying causal relations One well-known example of a system working on this basis is TETRAD The notion of conditional independence is void of time. The proponents of this mainstream method use 
temporal relationships, if they are available, to place constraints on the relationships among the attributes \(if we know x always appears before y then y cannot be a cause of x but time is not essential to the working of Proceedings of the 14th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI\22202 1082-3409/02 $17.00 \251 2002 IEEE 


their algorithms. These statistical methods have been used in many studies [2  pecially in s o cial sciences, where the notion of causality is subject to debate. We tried TETRAD on a very simple domain with straightforward causal ru les that were not subject to interpretation and debate, and were disappointed with the results [4, 5  Leav ing ou t ti m e  wh en d ealin g wit h  th e notion of causality seemed counterintuitive to us. The result was an investigation into the use of a standard tool C4.5 [1 t o di sc ove r as soci at i o ns gi ve n t e m poral l y ordered input data. We chose this tool because it is available in source code, and has been used widely in the literature C4.5 is a decision tree generator that also produces classification rules. It is a supervised tool that takes as input a series of attributes, called condition attributes and outputs the predicted value for a single decision attribute. The user has to specify which attribute is to be the decision attribute. This requirement makes the algorithm fast compared to the unsupervised methods, because only one attribute is considered instead of all possible relations among all the attributes. C4.5 assumes that all the attributes are observed at the same To go from normal associations to temporal and causal relations, we introduce time into the input as a preprocessing step, run C4.5, and then adjust the output to obey the original temporal relations as a postprocessing step. We thus use time, and not any statistical method, to justify the interpretation of association relations as causal ones. We have seen that this method gives results that agree better with common sense than statistical methods [4  In the rest of the paper we present TimeSleuth, the tool we have developed for the discovery of temporal and causal rules. TimeSleuth is an enhanced version of our RFCT software [7 e Sleu th is written in  Jav a and has a graphical user interface. It expands the abilities of C4.5 in several important ways. It is an unsupervised tool that can handle and interpret temporal data. It also helps the user in analyzing the relationships by enabling the user to see the rules, and statistics about them, in tabular forms.  For a theore tical treatment of TimeSleuth refer to [6  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the input to the system, and shows how we embed temporal data in the input to C4.5 by performing a preprocessing step. Section 2 also talks about the postprocessing step necessary to make sure that the user is presented with temporally valid output. Section 3 describes how TimeSleuth works, and shows how the user-interface helps in con ducting different experiments and making sense out of the results. Section 4 concludes the paper 2. Preprocessing and Post-Processing In this paper we consider a system as a black box that takes a set of inputs and produces a set of outputs. We observe the input and the output of the system over time and save the observations in records at regular intervals Assuming that we are observing 5 attributes x 1 to x 5 We thus end up with a temporally ordered series of records as shown in Figure 1, where for any t 1 and 5 n 1 x tn is the n th observed attribute at time t   x 11  x 12  x 13  x 14  x 15   x 21  x 22  x 23  x 24  x 25   x 31  x 32  x 33  x 34  x 35   x 41  x 42  x 43  x 44  x 45  Figure 1. Data produced by a system The trend in data mining is usually to ignore the temporal order among the records. Providing these data to C4.5 would allow it to find relationships among the attributes that are observed at the same time, which are non-temporal associations among the values of attributes However, the simple operation of merging the consecutive records with each other, called flattening  will provide C4.5 with more information as the current observations and the previous ones are seen together This brings the possible cause s and effects together. The flattening time window determines how many consecutive records are to be merged together. The window size, determined by the user, shows for how long the past can affect the present. Guessing this number may not be easy, but as we will see later TimeSleuth can explore a range of window sizes to choose a suitable one. As an example, Figure 2 shows the records of Figure 1 flattened with a time window of w 2  x 11  x 12  x 13  x 14  x 15  x 21  x 22  x 23  x 24  x 25  time 1:causes 001 time 2:effects  x 21  x 22  x 23  x 24  x 25  x 31  x 32  x 33  x 34  x 35  time 2:causes 001 time 3:effects  x 31  x 32  x 33  x 34  x 35  x 41  x 42  x 43  x 44  x 45  time 3:causes 001 time 4:effects Figure 2. Records in Figure 1, flattened with w 2 With the exception of the first and the last records each record appears twice, once as the "cause" part, and once as the "effect" part. The exceptions are because we cannot observe any causes for the first record or any effects for the last record. Generally, with a time window of w each record appears in w different flattened records with the exception of the first and last w records\. The effects" are assumed to exist only in the last time step Thus with a time window of w we are assuming that the Proceedings of the 14th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI\22202 1082-3409/02 $17.00 \251 2002 IEEE 


previous w 1 records contains the causes for the values observed in the w th record The preprocessing phase looses the temporal information, because the merged records no longer contain the original order. A non-temporal tool such as C4.5 would thus treat all the attributes as if they were seen at the same time. Thus in the output an attribute from the past may appear ah ead of an attribute from the future. To make sure that temporal order is respected in the output, TimeSleuth re-orders the attributes as needed This postprocessing step is meant to recover the lost information. In particular, the rule generation part c4.5rules\reorders the clauses of a rule to make sure that the attributes are encountered in temporal order.  For example, if c4.5rules generates a rule such as  IF x 11  1\ AND x 31 5\ AND x 24 1\ THEN x 35 true we transform it to the following:  IF x 11 1\ AND x 24 1\ AND x 31 5\ THEN x 35 true This modification to produce temporal rules does not require any changes in C4.5's algorithms in the decision tree generator or in the rule generator. Another way to ensure that temporal order is respected is to change the tree generation algorithm in such a way that the decision tree is temporally sorted, as explained in  3. TimeSleuth: How it Works In this section we introduce TimeSleuth as a tool. [4  p r o v i d e re po rt s o n t h e  ex peri m e nt s pe rf orm e d wi t h this tool, and compare it with other causality miners notably TETRAD. TimeSleuth is an application program written in Java, and thus usable anywhere a Java interpreter is available. However, it needs two of the C4.5 package's executable files, c4.5 and c4.5rules TimeSleuth is a causal rule discoverer, and mainly ignores the decision trees creat ed by C4.5 in the process of generating rules. Its functionality is divided between the TimeSleuth application and C4.5. This requires certain modification to be done in both c4.5 and c4.5rules sources, and then they should be compiled After this c4.5 and c4.5ru les understand new command line options, which are used by TimeSleuth to communicate with them. C4.5 is available publicly in source form, and standard patch files to make it compatible to TimeSleuth are included with the TimeSleuth package. However TimeSleuth can be used with reduced abilities, even if C4.5 has not been patched and recompiled. An option in TimeSleuth allows the user to inform it of this situation, so it will not provide the non-patched C4.5 programs with options they cannot understand The TimeSleuth application provides the user with a Graphical User Interface \(GUI\nput is the same as that of standard C4.5, which is a set of two files: A file with a .names extension contains the names of the condition attributes, while the decision attribute remains nameless. TimeSleuth calls the decision attribute simply originalDecision." The second file, with a .data extension, contains the observations of the condition and decision attributes. These are called "cases," and take the form of rows of data that correspond in order to the contents of the .names file. The value of the decision attribute always comes in the last column. To measure the predictive accuracy of th e resulting decision tree or rules, the user can provide a test files, containing unseen cases. A .test file has the same format as a .data file After C4.5 is done, it evaluates the tree or the rules based on the contents of the .test file, and reports the results. All three files \(names, data, test\should have the same name, and their extension determines their type Figure 3 shows a snapshot of TimeSleuth's input handling panel. After reading th e input files, a list of the discovered attributes is presented to the user. The user selects a decision attribute by highlighting it. The user should inform TimeSleuth about the presence of a .test file by clicking on the appropriate checkbox Figure 3  TimeSleuth 's input handling panel The data used in Figure 3 and the following figures contains weather observations gathered hourly. The decision attribute, "origina lDecision" in TimeSleuth, is the Soil Temperature Unlike with standard C4.5, in TimeSleuth the user can choose more than one decision attribute. In such cases C4.5 is invoked multiple times, each time with a different attributed as the decision attribute. TimeSleuth automatically generates the ap propriate .data, .test, and names files The user can choose to discretize the attributes using the "Discretization" panel in Figure 4. Two methods are available. In Method one, th e attribute's range of values as present in the input data file, is divided into segments Proceedings of the 14th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI\22202 1082-3409/02 $17.00 \251 2002 IEEE 


of equal length. Method 2 takes into consideration the distribution of the values, and divides the range into segments that contain the same number of values. This ensures the values in a denser region of the attribute's range are preserved. The steps taken in the discretization process are shown in Figure 4 Figure 4. The Discretization panel The main assumption in TimeSleuth is that the program is provided with the values that are snapshots They are observed at differ ent time steps. However, the user can instruct TimeSleuth to use the aggregate value of an attribute in forming its rules. For example, the user may decide to investigate the effect of the minimum value of the Air Temperature during a certain time window, as shown in Figure 5. In such a case TimeSleuth computes the minimum, and uses its value instead of individual temperature values. Going back to the example of Figure 2, c hoosing the aggregate function min x 1 would result in the record x 12  x 13  x 14  x 15  x 22  x 23  x 24  x 25   min x 11   x 11 In the actual output file the last attribute will be the decision attribute because that is the format expected by C4.5. The effect of having aggregate attributes is explained below, when we introduce the classification panel Figure 5. The Aggregation panel The actual running of C4.5 happens in the Classification panel, as shown in Figure 6. It allows the user to specify the location of C4.5's executable files and other related directories. The user can also provide any optional run-time arguments to C4.5, even though the arguments needed for TimeSleuth's functioning will be automatically provided. Here the user can inform TimeSleuth that C4.5 has not been patched. The default values provided in this panel make sure that C4.5 will function in a backward compatible way Figure 6. The Classification panel If C4.5 is not patched, TimeSleuth can still be used to discover causal relations, because it can perform the flattening operation with no need for C4.5 to be patched However, there is a potential problem here: C4.5 does not rely on the names of the attributes to identify them Rather, it uses their locations in the .data file. If TimeSleuth simply flattens the data and copies the names in the .names file multiple times, then in the output the attribute's names from different time steps would be confused. The x 11  x 21  x 31 etc. from Section 3 are not actually differentiated in a .names file, and all are called x 1 by C4.5. If c4.5rules has been patched  it actually outputs temporal information in the rules. So the rule from section 3 looks like this IF {At Time 1 x 1 1\ AND At Time 2 x 4 1 AT Time 3 x 1 5\HEN At Time 3 x 5 true This outlines the way the patched c4.5rules outputs its results. As seen later, TimeSleuth uses a tabular form to display the same information. If c4.5rules is unpatched then the user can instruct Ti meSleuth to add a time index _t<time>\ the names it generated. So c4.5rules' output would be temporally out of order, but still understandable because the attributes from different time steps are distinguishable An example is the following rule  IF {\(x 1 _t1 = 1\ AND \(x 1 _t3 = 5\ AND \(x 4 _t2 = 1 THEN x 5 _t3 = true. TimeSleuth can output these rules as Prolog statements, making them machine executable If aggregate attributes are pres ent, then the output rules will include the keyword "During Time Window" to make it clear that the aggregate value of the specified attribute is seen during the whole window. A rule would look like: IF {During Time Window x 3 0 AND At Time 1 x 1 1\ AND At Time 2 x 4 1\ AND AT Time 3 x 1 5\} THEN At Time 3 x 5 true C4.5 is supervised, because the user has to indicate the decision attribute, and also has to tell C4.5 exactly which values will be taken on by the decision attribute TimeSleuth allows the user to specify more than one decision attribute, and can optionally extract the values taken on by the decision attr ibute from the .data file. It outputs a warning message if the .test file contains a value that is not seen in the .data file. These abilities turn Proceedings of the 14th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI\22202 1082-3409/02 $17.00 \251 2002 IEEE 


TimeSleuth into an unsupervised tool, as the user simply has to run the program with minimal instructions as to the target attribute and the values it can have There are two time windows in the classification panel The first one, called "Flattening Time Window" is as the name implies. Its value is used to flatten the input data for both c4.5 and c4.5rules. This value is then provided to c4.5rules so that it can sort the output temporally However, this value is not provided to the tree generation program, c4.5. So the decision tree is generated with no regard to any time window. The value "c4.5Time Window" is meant to affect the decision tree, as explained in  Thi s val u e, i f  di ffe rent t h a n 1  s h oul d be the same as the Flattening time window. The rules generated by c45rules have a confidence level. In order to filter the rules, a user can specify a minimum confidence level, and only rules will higher confidence values will be presented Finding a suitable window size for the data under investigation can be a challenge. For this reason TimeSleuth allows the user to run it in a batch mode wherein it tries consecutive values for the time window Training and testing accuracy can be employed to guide the search. As shown in Figure 7, the user can decide to explore all values, or stop after the accuracy has reached a threshold, or after the accuracy has stopped improving The running time is determined by C4.5's speed, which in our experiments has been good, even for fairly large values of the window size Figure 7. Exploring different window sizes The user can perform the acausality test by choosing the backward flow of time. If the results are better than in the forward flow, then the relationship is acausal user interface provides help in making sense of the rules and relations among different attributes in the rules. Using the Analysis panel the user can instruct c4.5rules to output data necessary for tabular display of rules and the relevant statistics. This changes C4.5's normal output from text-based to tabular In the analysis panel, the user can see how the selected time window has affected the resulting rules. As shown in Figure 8, the user can opt to see the rules laid out according to the time step s in which the attributes appear. This display shows how important each attribute has been in forming the rules Figure 8.  Temporal layout of rules In Figure 9, many of the condition attributes used to determine the value of the soil temperature originalDecision\ come from previous time steps. In other words, the current temperature of the soil depends on attributes measured prev iously. Using standard C4.5 with such data obviously would not be as revealing. As seen in Figure 9, the previous value of soil temperature appears in 84.3% of the rules, which supports the common sense guess that the current temperature is determined mostly by the corresponding observation an hour ago Figure 9.  Statistics about the attributes In Figure 10, TimeSleuth shows the frequency of attribute usage in rules that were actually fired. In other words, the more a rule has been used \(on test data or on training data\e more important those attributes will be.  Both training and testing results are displayed. The two values are separated by Figure 10.  Frequency of attribute usage in rules Figure 11 shows some addition information about the rules and how they were used. The column headers are self-explanatory Proceedings of the 14th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI\22202 1082-3409/02 $17.00 \251 2002 IEEE 


Figure 11. Rule usage and other related data In TimeSleuth, to determine the quality of a set of rules and the strength of the relations among the attributes that is implied by the rules, we use the training or testing accuracy of the set of rule 4. Concluding Remarks We introduced TimeSleuth an unsupervised, learning tool based on C4.5 that is targeted for discovering causal and temporal relations. We saw that discovering causal relationships using associations is the norm in the literature. TimeSleuth does the same, but instead of using statistical methods it employs the common sense notion of temporal order to go from association relationships to temporal ones. The option to set the flow of time backward or forward allows the user to determine the causality or acausality of the ru les. Often the exact nature of a temporal relationship is not known. TimeSleuth helps the user to experiment with different scenarios and see what kind of rules are discovered when different time window values are used. The tabular output of information about the rules and the attributes helps the user assimilate the discovered relations TimeSleuth helps the user to analyze the rules produced by C4.5 by showing how important each attribute is at different times in determining the value of the decision attribute. This ability makes TimeSleuth a data mining tool \(with output suitable for a domain expert\as well as a machine learning tool \(with output consisting of ready-to-execute rules TimeSleuth is freely ava ilable for download from http://www.cs.uregina.ca/~kar imi/downloads.html or by contacting the authors.

The MOC is shown below in Figure 10. This software is hosted on Sun workstations running the Solaris operating system. The most recent missions are OV-3 and GALEX. Both programs are running smoothly and operating as planned. ACRIMSAT has recently converted over to using the MAESTRO system for operations as well.

By employing existing resources and knowledge from a program that was very mature, the Glory program is doing its part to contribute to cost saving measures and maximizing benefit to NASA. The Glory program provides savings of nearly $15M over a ground-up bus design effort, while mitigating significant risk on the bus portion of the mission  Glory is an ideal mission for ear th sciences in the realm of climate change research. It draws from significant flight heritage elements in both th e instruments and the spacecraft bus. It uses an existing NASA asset with minor refurbishment to save significant development costs. It uses a LV that has flown several NASA and DOD missions to date.
