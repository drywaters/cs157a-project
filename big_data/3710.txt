Fuzzy Association Rules in Soft Conceptual Hierarchie s   Trevor Martin  AI Group, Dept of Engineering Mathematics  University of Bristol, University Walk  Bristol BS8 1TR, UK  firstName.lastName@bristol.ac.uk  Yun Shen  AI Group, Dept of Engineering Mathemati cs  University of Bristol, University Walk  Bristol BS8 1TR, UK  firstName.lastName@bristol.ac.uk    Abstract  Humans frequently use a divide and conquer strategy to understand large volumes of data, by grouping similar items into progressively finer cat egories which form a conceptual hierarchy. Typically, such categories do not have crisp definitions but can be modelled by fuzzy set theory allowing computers to represent and reason about sets of objects in a way that reflects the human interpretation of  categories Association rules are a useful tool in knowledge discovery from databases but are normally defined in terms of crisp rather than fuzzy categories In this paper, we describe a new approach to finding association rules between fuzzy categories based on mass assignment theory In contrast to other fuzzy association methods, we retain a fuzzy confidence value rather than a point value  Keywords fuzzy association rules, mass assignment, fuzzy data mining, fuzzy hierarchies  I   I NTRODUCTION  H EADING 1  Information overload and the explosion in production transmission and consumption of data are well documented problems which contribute to the spread of digital obesity 1   Often much of the data relevant to a particular problem or decision is not held in a central, well structured location, but is scattered over different repos itories personal filestores web networked databases etc and in many cases is held in unstructured or semi structured formats A recent report 2  estimat ed that over 80 of corporate information consists of unstructured text Information can be drawn from diverse sources  for example, drawing from semi structured text data such as emails web fora news archives product manuals etc as well as more tradit ional databases, we may face tasks such as looking for recurring themes e.g complaints questions comments highlighting emerging issues or linking queries with relevant answers. emails, intranets, the web, etc  Our previous work within a project entitled ÒSmart Queries and Adaptive Data SQuAD is concerned with adding structure to data and refining approximate knowledge from this data \(see 3  Our aim is to assist in the creation of useful information from diverse sources of semi structured data  allowing extraction and integration from multiple sources of information and re organisation based on an individualÕs personal categories The final stage is to look for strong associations between different \(fuzzy\ categories  Su bstantial research efforts in disparate areas such as very large databases the semantic web knowledge management business intelligence etc have focused on the use of hierarchical approaches to categorise and summarise large quantities of data.  There is rarely a single unique hierarchy  instead, a human will choose the most appropriate way to split up the data according to their expertise  background knowledge and the problem at hand The ability to group multiple entities together into an approxima tely uniform whole allows us to efficiently represent a whole group as a single concept, enabling us to reason, and to derive knowledge about groups of entities. A simple form of derived knowledge is association essentially, that the extensions of two concepts overlap significantly. One of the fundamental tenets underlying fuzzy set theory 7 is the idea that humans work with groups of entities or conceptual categories that are loosely defined able to admit elements according to some scale of membership rather than according to an absolute yes/no tes t  Association rules \(in their crisp form\ are a well established technique for knowledge discovery in databases enabling interesting relations to be discovered There have been a number of proposals to develop fuzzy association rules, that is to disco ver the degree of association between fuzzy categories Some of our recent work  has used mass assignment theory 8   to develop a novel approach able to find a point valued association strength between fuzzy categories 11  and an interval valued version 12   In common with o ther work on fuzzy association rules most of our previous work assumes there is a crisp value for the rule confidence. We note that much of the power of fuzzy approaches arises from the ability to produce fuzzy results, i.e to effectively postpone the de cision on whether a given element ÒbelongsÓ to a set or not. For example, if a cooling fan is controlled by the rules  if temperature is a little high  increase fan speed slightly   if temperature is a little low decrease fan speed slightly  then a trad itional approach requires us to specify precise limits for the intervals  a little high  and  a little low  and precise single values for a  slight  increase or decrease in speed. In contrast, a fuzzy control approach allows us to define fuzzy terms and p ropagate them through the inference only converting to a crisp value at the final stage when a decision This work was partly funded by BT and t he Defence Technology Centre for Data and Information Fusion UK  978-1-4244-4577-6/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference \(NAFIPS2009 Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009 


must be made to change the fan speed In a similar vein we argue that in looking for association strengths between fuzzy categories it is better to p ropagate the fuzziness through the calculation and produce a fuzzy value rather than a single value to represent the confidence. Our mantra is fuzzy in, fuzzy out  The main contribution of this paper is a novel mass assignment based method for calculating a fuzzy confidence in associations between fuzzy categories It relies on a new method of converting fuzzy relations to mass assignments and a definition of membership in the fuzzy confidence values related to the movement of mass needed to produce that as sociation confidence value relative to the confidence value derived from a least prejudiced mass assignment The minimum and maximum values for the confidence can be found quickly and memberships calculated based on the corresponding mass assignments A full version including proofs, will appear in a subsequent paper [21    II  FUZZY SETS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS  Many authors e.g 13  have proposed the use of fuzzy sets to model uncertain values in databases and other knowledge based applications. The standard interpretation of a fuzzy set in this context is as a possibility distribution that is to say it represents a si ngle valued attribute which is not known exactly For example we might use the fuzzy set tall  to represent the height of a specific person or low to represent the value shown on a dice The fuzzy sets tall  and low  admit a range of values, to a greater or l esser degree; the actual value is taken from the range Knowing that a dice value val  is even  restricts the possible values to val=2 XOR val=4 XOR val=6  where XOR is an exclusive or If a fuzzy set on the same universe is defined as low 1/1, 2/1, 3/0 4} then knowing the value val  is low  restricts the possible values to val 1 XOR val 2 XOR val 3 with corresponding memberships  The conjunctive interpretation of a fuzzy set occurs when the attribute can have multiple values For example a person may be a ble to speak several languages; we could model this as a fuzzy set of languages, where membership would depend on the degree of fluency. This is formally a relation rather than a function on the underlying sets Our position is to make a distinction betwee n the  conjunctive interpretation  modelled by a monadic fuzzy relation  and the disjunctive interpretation   modelled by a possibility distribution To emphasise the distinction, we use the notation   F\(a\ = {x/µ\(x\ | x  U  to denote a single valued at tribute F of some object a \(i.e. a possibility distribution over a universe U\ and   R\(a\ = [x  x\ | x  U  to denote a multi valued attribute relation Fuzzy categories represent the latter case since we have multiple values that satisfy the predicate to a greater or lesser degree  A  Extending Association Rules to Fuzzy Categories  In creating association rules within transaction databases e.g 14  see also 15  fo r a clear overview the standard approach is to consider a table in which columns correspond to items and each row is a transaction. A column contains 1 if the item was bought, and 0 otherwise. The aim of association rule mining is to determine whether or not there are links between two disjoint subsets of items   for example do customers generally buy biscuits and cheese when buying beer and wine These disjoint subsets represent categories, as described earlier  Let I denote the set of items, so that an y transaction can be represented as tr  I and consider X the set of all transactions strictly speaking X is a multi set but can be made into a set by adding a unique identifier to each transaction We must also specify two categories or itemsets s  and t  which are non empty, non overlap ping subsets of I    t  I   s  I   s  t    and the sets of transactions containing s and t       S  x x  X  s  x   T  x x  X  t  x     An association rule is of the form s => t and is interpreted as stating that when the items in s appear in a transaction, it is likely that the items in t will also appear i.e it is not an implication in the formal logical sense A slight abuse of notation allows us to use S => T or s => t as the rule  Most authors use two measures to assess the significance of association rules The su pport of a rule s => t  is the number or relative number of transactions in which both s  and t  appear, and the confidence of the rule is an estimate \(based on the samples\ of the conditional probability of t being contained in a transaction given that it contains s     Support s  t    S  T  1     Conf s  t    S  T S  2  Typically a threshold is chosen for the support, so that only frequently occurring sets of items s  and t  are considered a second threshold filters out rules of low confidence  name  sales  salary   a  100  1000   b  80  400   c  50  800   d  20  700    good sales  high salary  confidence  sales  80  high  400  1  sales  50  high  500  0.667  sales>50  high>500  0.5  sales  50  high>800  0.333  Figure 1  A simple database of names a, b, c, d sales and salary figures top\and \(bottom\the confidences for an association rule good sales => high salary arising fr om different crisp definitions of the terms good sale s and high salary  The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference \(NAFIPS2009 Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009 


For example consider a database of sales employees salaries and sales figures A mining task might be to find out whether the good sales figures are achieved by the highly paid employ ees Given the database table in Fig 1 we can obtain rule confidences ranging from 1/3 up to 1 by different crisp definitions of good sales and high salary as shown at the bottom of Fig 1 Although this is a contrived example such sensitivity to th e cut off points adopted for crisp definitions is a good indication that a fuzzy approach is more in line with human understanding of the categories  Various approaches to fuzzifying association rules have been proposed e.g 15  The standard extension to the fuzzy case is to treat the sets S, T  as fuzzy and find the intersection and cardinality using a t norm and sigma count respectively     Conf S  T     S  T x   x  X   S x   x  X   3  In the example of Fig 1, a fuzzy appr oach would categorise employees according to whether their salaries are high  or medium  or low  and also according to whether their sales figures are good  moderate or poor Taking simple definitions for membership in goodSales and highSalary leads to    S  a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2    and   T = [a/1, b/0.4, c/0.8, d/0.7  which gives a confidence of 0.72 for the association S=>T  using eq. \(3  As pointed out by  15 using min and the sigma count for cardinality can be unsatisfactory because it does not distinguish between several tuples with low memberships and few tuples with high memberships for example      S  x 1 1   T  x 2 1    leads to Conf\(S, T\ = 0  but     S 1  x 1 1  x 2 0.01  x 3 0.01    x 1000 0.01   T 1  x 1 0.01  x 2 1  x 3 0.01    x 1000 0.01    leads to     Conf S 1  T 1    1000  0.01 1  999  0.01  0.91  which is extre mely high for two almost disjoint sets this example originally appeared in 18 Using a fuzzy cardinality i.e a fuzzy set over the possible cardinality values is also potentially pro blematic since the result is a possibility distribution over rational numbers, and the extension principle  19  gives a wider bound than it should due to negl ect of interactions between the numerator and denominator in Eq 2 For example, given   S = [x1/1, x2/0.8    T = [x1/1, x2/0.4   the fuzzy cardinalities are   S  T | = {1/1, 2/0.4   S | = {1/1, 2/0.8  leading \(by the extension principle\ to a confidence of  0.5/0.8, 1/1, 2/0.4  This is clearly incorrect as the confidence cannot be greater than 1, hence the extension principle is not appropriate here  III  FUZZY RELATIONS AS MASS ASSIGNMENTS  As with previous work 12, 20 we start from the fact that a relation represents a conjunctive set o f ordered n tuples i.e a conjunction of n ground clauses. For example, if U is the set of dice values then we could define a crisp predicate differBy4or5 on U  U as the set of pairs   1,6\, \(1,5\, \(2,6\, \(5,1\, \(6,1\, \(6, 2  This is a conjunctive set  in that each pair satisfies the predicate. In a similar way, a fuzzy relation represents a set of n tuples that satisfy a predicate to some degree Thus differByLargeAmount could be represented by  1,6\/1, \(1,5\/0.6, \(2,6\/0.6, \(5,1\/0.6, \(6,1\/1, \(6,2 0.6  The interpretation is not that a single pair satisfies this predicate but that one set of pairs  satisfies it out of several possible sets of pairs\. Thus the mass assignment is on possible relations     This is equivalent to treating the fuzzy r elation as a fuzzy set of crisp relations    Similarly a monadic fuzzy predicate largeValue  defines a set of 1 tuples such as [6/1, 5/0.8, 4/0.3  w h i c h  i s  w r i t t e n  a s  a  fuzzy set of crisp relations    and has the mass assignment   Our subsequent studies 20  show that this approach can sometimes overestimate the difference between full and nearly full membership  which can lead to unreasonably large intervals calculated for the confidence of association rules. For example, under this interpretation, the monadic fuzzy relation  S = [a/1 b/0.98  has the mass assignment     m S  a      0.02  a    a  b      0.98    The normal mass assignment interpretation a llows us to redistribute the mass on  a    a  b   to either of the relations  a  or a,b which leads to the family of distributions  The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference \(NAFIPS2009 Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009 


S = [a    1 x   ,   [a,b    x where 0   x   0.98  This flexibility in re assigning mass means that for a source relati on  S =  [a/1 b/0.98   and a target relation  T =  [a/1 b/0.98  c/0.02    we get an interval 0.51 1  w h i c h  i s  s u r p r i s i n g l y  w i d e  considering the two relations are so similar. We emphasise that this behaviour arises mostly in contrived cases and that small er intervals are calculated in the vast majority of real association rules encountered in experimental studies e.g 12   A  Alternative Interpretation of Relations as Mass Assignments  The approach discussed above, which we will refer to as an  open world approach, treats partial membership of a tuple x in a relation R i.e. 0  R x 1\  as an upper bound for the mass that can be assigned to any set of tuples including x This leads to a wide range of mass distributions that can be derived f rom the fuzzy relation R   In the open world approach, for any tuple x such that  R x  1, the total mass that can be assigned to relations containing x  is given by     0  m t   t  x 1    xn   x  t    R x    In the largeValue  example above consider the element x=5 which h as  R x 0.8; the relations containing 5 are [5, 6  and [4, 5, 6  a n d  w e  h a v e   0   m largeValue 5,6      m largeValue 4,5,6     0.8  This gives a considerable degree of flexibility in assigning mass The  alternative interpretation used in this paper  the closed world approach regards partial membership of a tuple x in a relat ion R i.e. 0  R x 1\ as strictly equal to the total mass assigned to the sets of tuples which include x i.e     m t   t  x 1    xn   x  t    R x    This means there is no flexibility in the range of mass distributions that can be derived from the fuzzy relation R  However, there is flexibility in the mass assignments when R is combined with an assignment corresponding to another relation, for example in calculating association confidences as described later  Under this interpretation the monadic fuzzy relation la rgeValue  discussed above has     m largeValue  6    0.2  6  5    0.5  6  5  4    0.3    and clearly    m largeValue 5,6      m largeValue 4,5,6      0  8   B  Closed world Mass based association rules  For a source category     and a target category    we can define the corresponding mass assig nments as follows. Let the set of distinct memberships in S be    where     and n S   S  Let     S i  x  S x     S  i       Then the mass assignment corresponding to S is  where   7  and we define     For example, the fuzzy category   S = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2  has the corresponding mass assignment    M S  a    0.2  a  b    0.3  a  b  c    0.3  a  b  c  d    0.2     We can now ca lculate the confidence in the association between the categories S and T using mass assignment theory In general this is not a unique value as we are free to move mass \(consistently\ between the cells corresponding to S i and T j for each i, j   For two m ass assignments     M S  S i  m S S i      1  i  n S M T  T j  m T T j      1  j  n T  the composite mass assignment is    M  M S  M T  X  m X      where m  is specified by the composite mass allocation function, subject to    m ij j  1 n T   m S S i   and    m ij i  1 n S   m T T j    This can be visuali sed using a mass tableau see 8   as shown in Figure 2.

a row column can be distributed amongst the cells provided row and column constraints are satisfied. We label the rows S 1  S 2 S nS  and columns  T 1 T 2 T nT  and assign mass m ij to cell i j  subject to row and column constraints The confidence in the association rule is given by    conf M    m ij  S i  T j   i  j  m ij  S i j n T              i  1 n S   n d where n  m ij  S i  T j   i  j  d  m ij  S i j n T              i  1 n S   S i  i  1 n S  m S i    7  Clearly n   0 d 0  and d is a constant for a given source relation S irrespective of M  For example consider the fuzzy categories  S = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2   and  T  a/1, b/0.4, c/0.8, d/0.7   The mass can be allocated in many ways subject to row and column constraints One notable assignment is the least prejudiced distribution obtained by taking the product of source and target masses for each cell as shown in fig 2. This corresponds to the minimum entropy combination of the source and target mass assignments. Different assignments lead to the minimum and maximum confidences    0.2  0.1  0.3  0.4    a  ac  acd  abcd  0.2  a  a  0.04  a  0.02  a  0.06  a  0.08  0.3  ab  a  0.06  a  0.03  a  0.09  ab  0.12  0.3  abc  a  0.06  ac  0.03  ac  0.09  abc  0.12  0.2  abcd  a  0.04  ac  0.02  acd  0.06  abcd  0.08   Figure 2  the mass tableau, showing intersections S i   T j and the least prejudiced mass distributi on.

C  Membership Function for Fuzzy Confidence  We define the me mbership function in terms of the quantity of mass which must be moved \(relative to the least prejudiced distribution\. The least prejudiced distribution is our reference point, and the resultant confidence is taken to have membership  1 Any other assign ment of mass requires one or more elementary mass transfers relative to the LPD and we are particularly interested in the mass assignments corresponding to minimum and maximum confidence M MIN  and M MAX  We define a fuzzy interval C representing the confid ence such that     C conf M      1  pos M LPD  M   N  where    N  max pos M max  M LPD    pos M min  M LPD      Because the membership function varies linearly with the amount of mass moved it is triangular and can be calculated quickly by considering the end points We note that it is possible for the membership function to be discontinuous at one end i.e to drop abruptly to zero Figure 6 shows the membership function for the fuzzy confidence in the good sales  high salary example with the calculations illustrated in figures 2, 4, and 5   Figure 6  Memb ership function \(y axis\for fuzzy confidence \(x axis\in the good sales high salary example. Note the discontinuity at 0.8  IV  S UMMARY  Starting from the premise that fuzzy results should not be prematurely converted into crisp values, we have developed a me thod which returns a fuzzy confidence for the association between two fuzzy sets interpreted conjunctively To our knowledge this is the only method that generates a fuzzy confidence value for association rules The method was developed in the context of hierarchical analysis but is suitable to calculate the fuzzy association between any  pair of fuzzy sets  R EFERENCES  1  Martin, T.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
