Agent-based Network Intrusion Detection System Using Data Mining Approaches Cheung-Leung Lui Data Cog Corporation Ltd matthew.lui@datacog.com Tak-Chung Fu Data Cog Corporation Ltd chung.fu@datacog.com Ting-Yee Cheung Data Cog Corporation Ltd alex.cheung@datacog.com Abstract Most of the existing commercial NIDS products are signature-based but not adaptive. In this paper, an adaptive NIDS using data mining technology is developed. Data mining approaches are used to accurately capture the actual behavior of network traffic, and portfolio mined is useful for differentiating 
normal and attack traffics. On the other hand most of the current researches are using only one engine for detection of various attacks; the proposed system is constructed by a number of agents, which are totally different in both training and detecting processes. Each of the agents has its own strength on capturing a kind of network behavior and hence the system has strength on detecting different types of attack. In addition, its ability on detecting new types of attack as well as a higher tolerant to fluctuations were shown. The experimental results showed that the frequent patterns mined from the audit data could be 
used as reliable agents, which outperformed from traditional signature-based NIDS 1. Introduction As networking becomes more widespread, the number of violations to normal operations is increasing. Current firewalls are not sufficient to ensure the security in computer networks, which some intrusions take advantages of vulnerabilities in computer systems or use socially engineered penetration techniques that traditional intrusion prevention techniques are not enough in protection Network Intrusion Detection System \(NIDS\will be 
another wall for protection. Most of the existing commercial NIDS are signature-based but not adaptive They have three main problems. First, attack stealthiness: attackers try to hide their actions from either an individual in monitoring the system or a NIDS. Second is a novel intrusion: it is undetectable by signature-based NIDS; they can only be detected as anomalies by observing deviations from normal network behavior. The last one is distributed attack: it is detected by correlation of attacks In this paper, an adaptive NIDS using data mining 
technologies is developed, which accurately capture the actual behavior of network traffic. The proposed NIDS is constructed by different types of agen There are five types of agent based on three data mining techniques, which are clustering, association rules and sequential association rules approaches. The normal behavior of a network can be profiled and anomaly traffic can easily be detected with the present of network portfolio. In addition, it can adopt the changes of network automatically with the adaptive learning of agents. This paper is organized into five 
sections. Section 2 contains a discussion on related works while the proposed agent-based NIDS is introduced in section 3. Experimental results are reported in section 4 and the final section concludes the paper 2. Related Work Most of the commercial NIDSs sold in the market are signature-based with a disadvantage in detection of previously known attacks only. Especially, different kinds of attack come every day. The signature-based NIDS will not be functional when new kinds of attack 
coming. Therefore, many researchers have proposed and implemented different intrusion detection models based on data mining techniques to tackle this problem. In this section, a brief review on current works is given NIDS need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible  dev el oped a g e n e ral and s y s t e m at i c  m e t h od f o r intrusion detection and provides an overview on two general data mining algorithms that have been implemented: association rules d f r equ ent  episodes In  7 u s i n g n e t w ork i n t r us i o n det ect i on

introduces a new type of clustering-based algorithm for unsupervised anomaly NIDS, which trains on unlabeled data in order to detect new intrusions  presents a data mining based approach to support signature discovery in NIDS. Furtherm  discusses outlier detection algorithms used in data mining systems In this paper, an adaptive NIDS based on various data mining techniques is proposed. However, unlike most of the current researches, which only one engine is used for detection of various attacks; the proposed system is constructed by a number of agents, which are totally different in both training and detection processes. In this stage, three data mining approaches clustering, association and sequential association, are adopted and five types of agent are built. After training with normal traffic for a network behavior, when new type of attack comes, the proposed system can detect such anomaly by distinguishing it from normal traffic 3. Proposed agent-based NIDS In this section, an adaptive NIDS based on a set of agents is proposed. Three main approaches focused on different features are described. Each approach is represented by a number of agents, which has strength on detecting a certain kind s of network intrusion detection. The overall architecture of the proposed system is first discussed in the next subsection while detail description of each agent is presented afterward 3.1. System architecture The proposed NIDS is composed of three modules feature extractor, detection agents and agent trainers First, a feature extractor converts the data from a monitored system into features which will be used in both training and network intrusion detection stages Figure 1 shows the overall system architecture  Network Traffic Feature Extractor Trainer Detection Engine Alarm Batch Processing Real Time Update Proposed IDS Figure 1. Architecture of agent-based NIDS In Detection Engine, a Feature Distributor allocates necessary feature vectors to each agent. In this stage three main data mining approaches, clustering association rules and sequential association rules are introduced. The results among all agents are gathered by the decision makers for making conclusion on the final decision of the system \(Figure 2 Alarm Set of Feature Agent Agent Agent    Feature Distributor Decision Maker Detection Engine Figure 2. Architecture of the detection engine For each detection agent, corresponding trainer is built for updating agent in an adaptive manner. Same as the Detection Engine, a Feature Distributor assigns necessary feature vectors to each training node. Each training node is built in a corresponding data mining approach and updated corresponding agent adaptively Figure 3 shows the structure of a Trainer Set of Feature Approach1 Approach2 Agent n    Feature Distributor Trainer Update Corresponding Agents Figure 3. Architecture of the agent trainer An anomaly detection model is based on normal behavior only and deviations from it. In other words the normal behavior of the network is profiled. This model is possibly high in false alarm rate as previously unseen \(yet legitimate\ system behaviors may be recognized as anomalies, but the adaptive ability of this model to the environment is expected in higher 3.2. Feature extractor The Feature Extractor has corresponding functions for each kind of statistics, and it is flexible to use. For example, the statistical figures of the frames of packet will be collected \(min/average/max value, unique item etc.\Those statistics form feature vectors for both detection and training processes. Currently, the system supports the following frame feature extraction 1 Min/Ave/Max value of a field 2 Number of unique item of a field 3 Time range covered by a frame 4 Number of packets in a frame 5 Number of packets in a frame after passing filter Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Information Technology and Applications \(ICITA05 0-7695-2316-1/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


6 Number of connection attempted to open in a frame 3.3. Clustering-based agent The clustering-based agent extracts properties from traffic in terms of frames, and tries to make the normal traffic from isolated clusters in training stage. Then each cluster will have its representative feature vectors representing certain normal property. For an unknown traffic to be clustered, its traffic property with those trained clusters is compared. If the unknown traffic vector has distance too further away from normal clusters, it is classified as attack traffic, or vice versa 3.3.1. Feature selection Different feature sets for different clustering-based agents are shown in Table 1 The features selected are specifying for the quantity based attacks such as probing and denial of service Table 1. Features for clustering-based agents Agent Feature selected Cluster TCP Number of unique ports accessed Mean packet size Number of RST packets Time range covered by frame Cluster UDP Number of unique ports accessed Mean packet size Number of ICMP packets Time range covered by frame Cluster SYN flood Number of unique ports accessed Number of connection open attempted Number of RST packets Time range covered by frame 3.3.2. Frame formation In the proposed NIDS, the basic unit for feature extraction is frame. A frame contains a number of packets; Figure 4 demonstrates the frame formation. There are four basic frame formations: jump time frame, slide time frame, jump packet frame and slide packet frame. Tables 2 and 3 show their corresponding behaviors Figure 4. Different frame formations Table 2. Behaviors of jump frame vs. slide frame Jum p frame Slide frame 1 Generate less marginal frame 2 Less attack tuples in total 1 Generate more marginal frame 2 More attack tuples in total Table 3. Behaviors of time frame vs. packet frame Time frame Packet frame 1.More attack tuples in total 2.Normal data becomes very noisy in short time frame 1.Less attack tuples in total 2.Normal data is less noisy in short packet frame 3.3.3. Training phase  cluster formation The performance of two clustering approaches is evaluated first. They are k means and hierarchical clustering. The properties of different approaches are shown in Table 4 Table 4 k means vs. hierarchical clustering k means Hierarchical 1.Fast in speed 2.Less accurate than hierarchical 3.Accuracy depends on the seeding method 1 Slow in speed 2 More accurate than k means 3 Accuracy depends on the distance renew method Although Table 5 shows that the detection rate of hierarchical clustering gains a little bit advantage compared to k means clustering, the hierarchical clustering needs higher dimensional space and the computational complexity increases exponentially with increasing of number of features. Thus, in this paper the k means clustering approach is chosen as default approach for clustering-based agents unless specify Table 5. Detection rate on different clustering approaches \(jump packet frame = 100 packet True positive False negative True negative False positive Hierarchical 97.23% 2.77% 99.78% 0.22 k means 97.15% 2.85% 99.79% 0.21 3.3.4. Detection Engine It is based on how far Euclidean distance\ a candidate cluster from normal. If the distance is larger than a threshold, the cluster will be regarded as an intrusion, or vice versa 3.4. Association rule-based agent This agent finds out the relationship between features selected and traffic property. The features used are commonly tested in clustering algorithm 3.4.1. Feature selection There are four features selected: 1\ber of unique ports accessed \(large if attack\erage packet size in frame \(smaller than normal traffic\ber of ICMP destination unreachable packet in frame \(large because of victim response\d 4\ Time range covered by packets \(port scan usually shows a burst in short time range, and so shorter time range Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Information Technology and Applications \(ICITA05 0-7695-2316-1/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


3.4.2. Training phase  rules formation The basic association rule algorithm [12 w ill b e u s ed to cap tu re  the rule of selected features on network traffic 3.4.3. Detection Engine The number of rules each connection matched is counted. If the frequency is larger than a threshold, it is declared as normal traffic 3.5. Sequential rule-based agent Besides capturing the general behaviors of normal network traffic, there are some common sequential patterns at connection level of a normal traffic and different sequential patterns in attack traffic. Thus, the sequential rule-based agent can help to extract pattern rules for differentiating the normal traffic and intrusion 3.5.1. Feature selection 6 TCP flags: URG, ACK PSH, RST, SYN and FIN, are used as the items in the rule mining process 3.5.2. Training phase  rules formation The sequential association rule algorithm [13 w i l l b e u s ed  to capture the sequential pattern in network traffic dialog. To facilitate the association mining process using different minimum support for different itemset is applied \(e.g. 1-itemset and 2-itemset has different minimum support\ depreciation mechanism is defined in the following formula where minimum support is decreased by a specified depreciation percentage depr or example, if initial support is set to 100% and depr is 90%, then 1-itemset support 100% and 2-itemset support = 100%*90% = 90%, etc    1    K K support depr support where K is K itemset 3.5.3. Detection engine There are two parameters can be adjusted. For each frame, when the number of abnormal connections matched within the packet/time frame is larger than a threshold, the frame will be declared as intrusion. The other is minimum number of abnormal connections in one frame, which will initiate an attack alarm MIN_ATTACK itial threshold is 10%. The best initial value of MIN_ATTACK is got under a training process 3.6. Decision maker As this system is composed of a batch of agents, a policy is used to make alarm declaration decision and shown in Figure 5. The true attack is expected to have alarm generated from both clustering based and rule based agents \(overlapped area in Figure 6\Therefore the false alarm from one side may be eliminated due to the agents at another side may not generate alarm Figure 5. Alarm declaration policy structure Figure 6. Alarm relationship 4. Experiments In this section, an investigation on the performance of proposed NIDS is studied, and also, different types of attack are tested to evaluate the strength and limitation of each agent. Finally, an open source signature-based NIDS  SNORT [14 s e rv ed as a  benchmark in the experiments 4.1. Experimental settings The traffic data from MIT Lincoln Laboratory  is used for training and performance testing. The attack scenario lasts for 7 weeks \(7 days per week\he MITs description for those attacks is shown in Table 6 Table 6.

4.2. Parameters settings Jump packet mode in frame extracted is used and set as 100 packets. In cluster-based agent, the k means clustering approach was adopted and the statistic seed is set with k 256. Squared-error threshold is set to 0 did not set\ and maximum loop count is 500. Detail features selected for each clustering-based agent were specified in section 3.3.1. In rule-based agent minimum support is set to 100% and depreciation percentage depr 96%. Finally, the threshold settings for different agents used are listed in Table 7. For the tidy representation of data, the different combinations of agents are represented in Table 8 Table 7.

Detection rate \(TP\ refers to the ratio between the number of correctly detected attacks and the total number of attacks while false alarm \(FP\means the ratio between the number of normal connections that are incorrectly misclassified as attacks and the total number of normal connections 4.3. Experimental results As each agent is intended to inspect specific kind of traffic, there is lower detection rate in each agent and higher false alarm rate from certain agent. After the alarm decision, a higher detection rate can be achieved while policy applied limits the false alarm rate. The rule-based agents yield better detection rate than clustering-based agents on the same attack type, due to its tolerance on noisy background and the adapting ability on attack speed. Summary of the results are shown in Table 9, 10 and Figures 7, 8 Table 9.

                Figure 8. Detection rate on MIT lab dataset The benchmarking traditional signature-based NIDS shows that for the attack type without signature, the detection rate is very low, while the proposed NIDS which only based on normal traffic shows its strength on capturing unseen attack 5. Conclusions Commercial signature-based NIDS is weak in detection of previously unknown attacks. In this paper an agent-based NIDS based on various data mining techniques is proposed. Unlike most of the current research, which use only one engine for detection of various attacks, the proposed system is constructed by a number of agents. The NIDS can broaden its view on different behaviors of the network traffic by each of the agents with its own strength on capturing a kind of network behavior. In addition, training with only normal traffic is the process to profile the normal behavior of a network for detecting new types of attack and higher tolerance to the fluctuation. The experimental results show that the frequent patterns mined from the audit data can be used as reliable agents. The agents are outperformed from traditional signature-based NIDS For future development, the following directions are proposed: \(i\elop more agents which are strength on other aspects, \(ii\ to set the thresholds by the system with minimum human interrupt and also iii\troduce incremental updating mechanism for the detection agents 6.

which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
