SMA adopts two-way sampling technique in every website and amalgamates those local samples into a sampling dataset. In an empirical study, SMA was able to accelerate the speed and improve the accuracy of mining association rules in distributed database Keywords-sampling; association rules; distributed database I   I NTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of database and internet, the database is becoming very large, multi-dimensional and distributed. The volume of data in distributed database is growing faster than the speedup in processing times. And data mining is one of effective means to solve these problems, in which association rules mining is a hotspot. At present, the frequent pattern is still the main task of mining association rules in distributed database, and the algorithms have FDM [1 D D M  2 F D M A 3  a nd so o n I n F D MA  obtain global-frequent itemsets based on transferring those bounded sub-trees, although it can reduce amount of communication overhead compared with the FDM and DDDM, pretreatment still isn't used in local sites, so the efficiency of processing data is still lower. In our study, a sampling algorithm, SMA, is proposed   A  Association rules mining Association rules identify relationships among sets of items and can be used to evaluate business trends, identify purchasing patterns, and classify customer groups. In brief an association rule is an expression Y X  where X and Y are itemsets and 001Y X   Two measures is support and confidence. And the support of the rule is the probability that X and Y hold together among all the possible presented cases. And the confidence is defined as the percentage of transaction containing Y in addition to X with regard to overall number of transactions containing X The problem of discovering all association rules can be decomposed into two subproblems [4    Find all frequent sets of items that have transaction support above minimum support   Use the frequent itemsets to generate the desired rules In distributed database, there are some correlation between Local frequent itemsets and global frequent ones such as   A global frequent item set is not sure to be a local frequent item set   Each global frequent item set is at least a local frequent item set in one site If we obtain the global frequent itemsets by finding local frequent itemsets in each local database, it will be need for expensive I/O operation cost and the cost of communications. But it is inconceivable that we mine global frequent itemsets directly in the whole large database which is formed by all data in every website. So the size of the data sets will be affected to the execution efficiency of association rule mining algorithm. This paper introduces a new sampling technique, which would be used to process the data in every website. Then a whole sampling database would be generated, in which we can find the global frequent itemsets directly. Therefore, the speed of process the data in distributed database will be accelerated B  Sampling thinking The Despite a complete data set is very important for getting reliable conclusions, but this is not entirely necessary The reason as follows   There is more data redundancy in complete data set than in the sample data sets   There is relatively expensive I/O operation cost in complete data set   There is some instability in large distributed data set which may affect on discovering the eventual of knowledge Sampling is a practical data reduction technique that has been applied to a variety of problems in database systems Zaki, et al m p l e  r a n d o m sa m p l e t o  o b t a i n  association rules, and John and Langley [7 sc uss a dynamic sampling method that selects the sample size based on the observed behavior Chen, Haas and Scheuermann r opo se a ne w  t w o phase sampling based algorithm for discovering association rules that in phase I, a large initial sample of transactions is collected and used to quickly and accurately estimate the support of each individual item in the database, and in phase II, a small final sample is obtained from the initial sample by trimming tactic

II   S AMPLING MINING ALGORITHM  A  SMA basic idea The SMA algorithm mines association rules as follows a  Obtain an initial random sample Si from Di b  Obtain a reduced sample set by using a two-way sampling technique c  Trim those large sample sets based on Minimum entropy function d  Generate a whole sampling database e  Run a standard association rules algorithm to mine the final association rules with minimum support p and confidence c  B  Type of sampling How to choice initial sample in two-phase sampling is a strategic problem, and the method is that such as simple random sampling with replacement \(SRSWR\, simple random sampling without replacement \(SRSWOR systematic random sampling \(SRS\ and so on. The SRSWR requires that each element has an equal probability of being included in the sample. In practice, SRSWOR is carried out because there is no need to collect the information more than once from an element. Additionally, SRSWOR gives a smaller sampling variance than SRSWR. SRS selects every k-th element after a random start \(between 1 and k\, and if N denotes the number of transaction in initial database that there will be K N  elements to compose initial sample Because the data of original transaction database is random SRS is used to obtain initial sample C  Two-way sampling technique In the two-stage sampling process, the goal is to obtain a smaller but more representative sample by trimming the initial sample at second phase. In other words, those unimportant   transactions are cut from the first samples, so that the final samples have higher precision. In the procedure of the cutting, we cite a distance function Let Di\(1 i n\be a partitioned database located in n sites S1,S2 Sn with their names as D1,D2 Dn respectively. We denote by Si initial samples obtained from Di, and by I k Di\ the collection of k-itemsets in Di, and by FSi the final sample after implementation of the algorithm Let A and T be an arbitrary item set and transaction set respectively. We define n\(A,T\ to be the number of transactions in T that contain A and |T| to be the total number of transactions in T. Then the support of A in Di and in Si is given by Support\(A,Di\=n\(A,Di\|Di| and Support\(A,Si\=n\(A,Si\/|Si|, respectively We use a distance function              Si  Si I A k Si A Support FSi A Support Si F Dist  1  to trim the initial samples based on two properties as follows   For a transaction t Si, compute function Dist\(Si{t},Si\d choice that transaction t whose value is minimum to be trimmed from sample Si. Because the function Dist\(Si-{t},Si\reflects the importance of T in the sample Si, that is the more unimportant matters have the smaller value of the function   For a transaction t Si but FSi t   compute function Dist\(FSi+{t},Si\, and choice that transaction t whose value is maximum to be added to sample FSi. Because the function Dist\(FSi+{t},Si reflects the importance of T in the sample FSi, that is the more important matters have the greater value of the function This paper introduces SMA\(Sampling Mining Algorithm\, a two-way sampling technique that can trim some more unimportant transactions from Si and add other more important transactions to FSi based on two properties as above in every cycle. It is clear that the algorithm can accelerate the speed and reduce the cost of I / O operation in distributed database D  The SMA algorithm The general structure of the SMA algorithm is given in the Fig. 1 III  P ERFORMANCE STUDY  In this section we describe an empirical study carried out to evaluate the performance of SMA. All experiments were performed on Genuine Intel\(R\ies Windows Server multi-user LAN with a processor speed of 173 MHZ. In LAN, there are three computers constitute distributed sites and there are equal recorders in every site A  Experimental method In order to test the performance of the algorithm, we used a synthetic database. The database D was generated using data synthesis method  t h en w a s d i vi de d e q u a l l y t o t h re e sites. The total numbers of transactions and items are 390K and 1000 respectively, the number of maximal potentially global-frequent items is 1500, and the average length of transactions is 10, and the average length of maximal potential frequent itemsets is 4. We used a minimum support of 0.75%, at which level there would be neither too many nor too few frequent itemsets, and the length of the maximal frequent itemsets is 8 B  Experimental result We performed experiments using SMA, SRS, DDDM and FDMA. For each database, we executed algorithms 10 times, thus each performance data reported below is an average of 10 observations, but not be actual value at a time At first, we examined the performance of the different algorithms in terms of accuracy in a different sampling rate The measure of accuracy is defined as follows [9

As shown in the fig. 2, SMA is faster than DDDM, and FDMA IV  C ONCLUSIONS  We have introduced in this paper a sampling algorithm to mine association rules in distributed database, SMA adopts two-way sampling technique in every website, that is cutting out some unimportant transactions from initial samples, as well as adding other important transactions to the final results of the samples gradually. And trim those large sample sets based on Minimum entropy function.

The competences at the bottom of the list indicate the smallest gap between importance and level of development indicating that their development is closely matched to need Interestingly all gaps are positive indicating rated importance is higher than level of development \(on the same rating scale\ in all cases There is some variation in the ranking of the gap across Europe. For example, in Bulgaria the top 5 ranked gaps are  1  Planning and time management 2  Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team 3  Knowledge of a second language 4  Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit 5  Oral and written communications in your native language  For French academics Capacity for generating new ideas creativity\ is top with Knowledge of a second language second. Irish academics rank Capacity to adapt to new situationsŽ top  C  The employer view of generic competences The 112 completed questionnaires returned by employers show a slightly different view to students and academics.  In the top 5 ranking of importance of the generic competences are Problem SolvingŽ, Team workingŽ and Capacity for applying knowledge in practiceŽ in common with students and academics but also Concern for qualityŽ and Capacity to learnŽ.  Both understandable from an industrial perspective Employers, like students rated Elementary computing skillsŽ first in terms of level of development followed by Capacity to learnŽ, an encouraging result for HEIs.  Oral and written communications in your native languageŽ came third followed by Will to succeedŽ and Basic general technical knowledge of the profession of your work ar eaŽ.  Surprisingly Planning and time managementŽ can in the bottom 5 … this should be a concern for HEIs as most of us expect good demonstration of this competence in examination preparation individual and group projects and general assignment work Table 6 shows the employers rating of the gap in the generic competences Top of the list overall is Concern for qualityŽ. This is dominated by a clear difference at the Masters level. At the Bachelor level the greatest gap is in TeamworkingŽ. Planning and time managementŽ is second overall, again principally because of the Master level res ponses, it is ranked 6 th for Bachelor students. It is clear from the top few in the list where employers feel the academic programmes their graduate recruits have taken are falling short of their needŽ in the generic competences  TABLE VI  A LL EMPLOYER RATING OF THE  GAP  IN THE GENERIC COMPETENCES  Rank Generic competence Mean 1 Concern for quality 0.79 2 Planning and time management 0.75 3 Capacity for applying knowledge in practice 0.74 4 Problem solving 0.72 5 Team working 0.72   28 Research skills 0.33 29 Grounding in basic knowledge of the profession of your area 0.26 30 Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality 0.26 31 Understanding of cultures and customs of other countries 0.14 32 Elementary computing sk ills 0.09  Encouragingly at the bottom of the list there appears to be no issue with Elementary computing skills alt hough the academics who feel that this is not a core com ponent of their degree programme will gain little comfort from this outcome The other competences at the bottom of the Table 6 are generic competences employers feel are being developed in line with their rating of its importance There is variation in the way employers in different countries rate the gap between importance and level of development of the generic competences. The top ranked gap is   Bulgaria: Capacity for applying knowledge in practiceŽ, Decision makingŽ, LeadershipŽ \(equal top   France: Capacity to adapt to new situations TeamworkingŽ \(equal top   Germany: Planning and time management   Ireland: Teamworking   Poland: Planning and time management   Slovak Republic: Ability to work aut onomously IV  HOW THE GENERIC COMPETENCES GROUP  Factorial analysis was used to group the generic competences.  Across all the responses the 32 generic competences factored into 5 groups 1   Internationalisation Understanding of cultures and customs of other countries.Ž Appreciation of ethical issues.Ž Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality International relations and collaborationsŽ, Ability to work in an international context 2   Entrepreneurship Patents and IPRŽ, Creativity Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit 3   Professional skills Grounding in basic knowledge of the professionŽ, Basic general technical knowledge 72 


Capacity for analysis and synthesisŽ, Research skills Capacity to learn 4   Interpersonal skills LeadershipŽ, Interpersonal skillsŽ, Ability to communicate with non-expertsŽ, Oral and written communications in native languageŽ, Critical and self-critical capabilityŽ, Teamworking 5   Personal skills Ability to work autonomously Problem solvingŽ, Capacity to adapt to new situations Knowledge of a second languageŽ, Concern for qualityŽ, Will to succeedŽ, Elementary computing skillsŽ, Capacity for applying knowledge in practice Decision makingŽ, Project design and management Information management skills Table 7 shows the mean importance of each gr oup of competences by stakeholder group for the First Cycle Degree respondents. For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is Problem solvingŽ. Second in the ranking for students is Elementary computing skillsŽ. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageŽ and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with Personal skillsŽ rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by Professional skillsŽ, Interpersonal skillsŽ, InternationalisationŽ and EntrepreneurshipŽ. The smallest mean Internationalisation is just over midway between weakŽ and considerableŽ. Given the European Unions desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that Professional skillsŽ are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by Personal sk illsŽ and Interpersonal skillsŽ. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
