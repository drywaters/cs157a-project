challenge in big data analysis nowadays is detection of cohesive groups in large-scale networks including social networks genetic networks communication networks and so In this paper we propose LabelRank anef 336 cient algorithm detecting communities through label propagation A set of operators is introduced to control and stabilize the propagation dynamics These operations resolve the randomness issue in traditional label propagation algorithms LPA stabilizing the discovered communities in all runs of the same network Tests on real-world networks demonstrate that LabelRank signi 336 cantly improves the quality of detected communities compared to LPA as well as other popular algorithms Keywords social network analysis community detection clustering group I I NTRODUCTION One type of the basic structures of sociology in general and social networks in particular are communities e.g see 2 In sociology community usually refers to a social unit that shares common values and both the identity of the members and their degree of cohesiveness depend on individuals\222 social and cognitive factors such as beliefs preferences or needs The ubiquity of the Internet and social media eliminated spatial limitations on community range resulting in online communities linking people reg ardless of their physical location The newly arising computational sociology relies on computationally intensive methods to analyze and model social phenomena 1  i n c lu d i n g co m m u n ities a n d th eir d etectio n  Analysis of social networks has been used as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of socio logical theory The classical example of the approach is presented in 3 that elaborated the macro implications of one asp ect of small-scale interaction the strength of dyadic ties Communities in social networks are discovered based on the observed interactions between people With the rapid emergence of large scale online social networks e.g Facebook that connected a billion users in 2012 there is a high demand for ef 336 cient community detection algorithms that will be able to handle large amount of data on a daily basis Numerous techniques have been developed for community detection However most of them require a global view of the network Such algorithms are not scalable enough for networks with millions of nodes Label propagation based community detection algorithms such as LPA 5  and S LP A 7  6  w hos e s ource codes are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/site communitydetectionslpa require only local information They have been shown to perform well and be highly ef 336 cient However they come with a great shortcoming Due to random tie breaking strategy they produce different partitions in different runs Such instability is highly undesirable in practice and prohibits its extension to other applications e.g tracking the evolution of communities in a dynamic network In this paper we propose strategies to stabilize the LPA and to extend MCL 8 ap p r o ach th at resu lted i n a n e w a lg o r ith m called LabelRank that produces deterministic partitions II R ELATED W ORK Despite the ambiguity in the de 336 nition of

be found in 25  Label propagation and random walk based algorithms are most relevant to our work The LPA 4 u s e s t he net w ork s t r uct u re al one t o gui de i t s process It starts from a con 336 guration where each node has a distinct label At every step each node changes its label to the one carried by the largest number of its neighbors Nodes with same label are grouped together after convergence The speed of LPA is optimized in 5 Leung 27  e x t e nds LP A b y incorporating heuristics like hop attenuation score COPRA 9 a nd S L P A 6  e xt end L P A t o det ect i o n o f o v e rl

002 002 introduced Multi-level Regularized MCL making it complex In contrast we address the scalability by introducing new operator conditional update and the novel stopping criterion preserving the speed and simplicity of the LPA based algorithms III L ABEL R ANK A LGORITHM LabelRank is based on the idea of simulating the propagation of labels in the network Here we use node id\222s as labels LabelRank stores propagates and ranks labels in each node During LabelRank execution each node keeps multiple labels received from its neighbors This eliminates the need of tie breaking in LPA[4 a n d COPRA  9  e.g  multiple labels with the same maximum size or labels with the same probability Nodes with the same highest probability label form a community Since there is no randomness in the simulation the output is deterministic LabelRank relies on four operators applied to the labels i propagation ii in 337 ation iii cutoff and iv conditional update Propagation  In each node an entire distribution of labels is maintained and spread to neighbors We de 336 ne 1 002 isSubset P   P  5 where 1  As expected 1  Intuitively isSubset can be viewed as a measure of similarity between two nodes As shown in Fig 1 i j i is the set of maximum labels which includes labels with the maximum probability at node 1 0 Nb Nb 2 c c c c c j C s 004 isSubset c i i c c   2 th power i  i i simultaneously using the following equation i j j i i is normalized to make a probability distribution In matrix form this operator can be expressed as i i i i i j i r on r constrains the label propagation with help from in 337 ation that decreases probabilities of labels to which propagation assigned low probability More importantly r ef 336 ciently reduces the space complexity from quadratic to linear For example with j i is the degree of node q operator successfully traps the process in the modularity space with high quality indicated by a longlived plateau in the modularity curve red curves Equation 5 augments the stability of the label propagation Stop criterion  One could de 336 ne the steady state of a node as small difference in the label distribution between consecutive iterations and determine the overall network state built upon node states In fact the above conditional update allows us to derive a more ef 336 cient stop criterion linear time We determine whether the network reaches a relatively stable state by tracking the number of nodes that update their label distributions i.e implicitly tracking the number of nodes that potentially change their communities 003 qk 1 002 C 1 where 2 operator will changed pr obabilities to 0 6923 ad 0.3077 respectively In our tests this operator helps to form local subgroups However it alone does not provide satisfying performance in large networks Moreover the memory inef\336 ciency problem implied by Eq 2 i.e  c j s.t n label distribution matrix  To initialize i i   002 002 002 002 003 003 003 3 004  It updates a node only when it is signi 336 cantly different from its neighbors in terms of labels This allows us to to preserve detected communities and detect termination based on scarcity of changes to the network At each iteration the change is accepted only by nodes that satisfy the following update condition   0 004   in a hash table The algorithm 139 0  327 C taken from a 336 nite set of alphabet count 005 n C s    n vectors in is the parameter taking on real values Unlike MCL we apply it to the label distribution matrix in 002 002 002 n is the number of nodes which are separate from adjacency matrix Nb Nb   is proportional to k k 1  the average number of labels in each node is typically less than 0  Explicit Conditional Update  As shown in Fig 1 green curve the above three operations are still not enough to guarantee good performance This is because the process detects the highest quality communities far before convergence and after that the quality of detected communities decreases Hence we propose here a novel solution based on the conditional update operator 002             returns 1 if   327 002 numChange  at each iteration and accumulate the

of execution In LabelRank each node broadcasts the distribution to its neighbors at each time step and computes the new distribution 


nP matrix In the implementation this is not needed Thanks to both cutoff and in 337 ation operators the number of labels in each node monotonically decreases and drops to a small constant in a few steps The   Fig 1 The effect of conditional update operator The plot shows the modularity n in ii ij i ij i i denotes the ij to ij of ij no longer 140 327   Purple circle indicates the 327 i at i  by taking into account node\222s own label distribution Thus during initialization each node considers itself a neighbor while using Eq 1 Both LabelRank and MCL use matrix multiplication i neighbors reducing the time for computing the i i requires  operations where 006 327 006 327  8 until stop criterion satis 336 ed 9 output communities These four operators together with a post-processing that groups nodes whose highest proba bility labels are the same into a community form a complete algorithm see Alg 1 An example network as output by LabelRank is shown in Fig 2 There are only 1.2 labels on average and at most two in each node resulting in a sparse label distribution Table I of which second row shows for each node the label with the highest probability identifying this node community Three communities are identi 336 ed each sharing a common label red community label 3 green community label 5 and blue community label 11 The resultant 0  004 004 004 6 004 004 7 004  where M for MCL M is the n stochastic matrix For updating an element both M th row and th column of matrix A r q i 1  and do not consider when tuning parameters for optimal performance It turns out that the preprocessing that adds a sel 337 oop to each node i.e j and j seem to require j denotes the kn 1  helps to improve the detection quality The sel 337 oop effect resembles the lazy walk in a graph that avoids the periodicity problem but here it smooths the propagation update of 327 133 two curves on the top and wiki network with 066 two curves at the bottom Each count of any P for LabelRank and M       P P P 327 P k x m 002 003 004 numChange 336 rst exceeds some prede 336 ned frequency e.g 336 ve in our experiments or no change for this iteration i.e numChange=0 Although such criterion does not guarantee the best performance it almost always retu rns satisfying results The difference between the found A 7 P 5 Q purple circles and maximum Q red asterisks is small as illustrated on two networks in Fig 1 Note that this stop criterion is also applicable when network state oscillates among a group of states Algorithm 1 LabelRank 1 add sel 337 oop to adjacency matrix A 2 initialize label distribution P using Eq 3 3 repeat 4 P P P P P P also distinguishes two types of nodes the border ones with high probability labels e.g 3 5 and 11 and the core nodes with positive but not largest label probabilities e.g 1 13 and 15 The latter are well connected to their communities In the analysis we set the length of P n  creating a n P matrix is replaced by n variable-length vectors usua lly short carried by each node as illustrated in Table I Another advantage is that the algorithm performance is not sensitive to the cutoff threshold r sowe setitto A P A M n P M O X i X j X  However since A represents the static network structure no operations are needed for zero entries in A for LabelRank Thus the number of effective operations for each node is de 336 ned by k P O x labels typically less than 3 in each node on average updating one row P O P in LabelRank is O O O k is the average degree and m is the total number of edges In contrast during the expansion before convergence M M that rises to power larger than 1 is changed according to the de 336 nition of transition matrix of a random walk After that values in M 1     With  operations As a result the time for updating the entire  327  Q over iterations on the email network with n  n  Q is computed explicitly for each iteration Green curve is based on three operators Propagation+In 337 ation+Cutoff Red curve is based on four operators Propagation+In 337 ation+Cutoff+Conditional Update Asterisk indicates the best performance of Q Q achieved when the stop criterion described in the main text is used stops when the xk xm  t

be able to design ef 336 cient algorithms e.g distributed social-based message routing algorithm for highly distributed and self-organizing applications such as ad hoc mobile networks and P2P networks We also plan to extend LabelRank to overlapping community detection 24 i n t he near future In the experiments we explored and demonstrated the good detection quality on some real-world networks We

Each tuple in relations and consists of a 64-bit key and a 64-bit payload We compare the performance of Distribute Bitmap Join and no-partition hash join algorithm from two aspects One is to compare the running time of both algorithms under different overlap ratios The other is to compare the running time of both algorithms with different number of threads The result of comparison between Distributed Bitmap Join and no-partition hash join algorithms when the overlap ratio of query set ranging from 40 percents to 100 percents is shown in Fig 1 The performance of Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm is better than no-partition hash join In addition the running time keeps decreasing when the overlap ratio becomes larger On the other hand there is almost no change of execution time for no-partition hash join when overlap ratio changes It is because hash join algorithm itself is not affected by overlapped queries If we consider both Join algorithms as two phases build phase which includes establishing dictionaries bitmaps and hash indexes and join phase which includes matching tuples then the execution time can be divided into two parts which is shown in Fig 2 When the overlap ratio increases the running time for both build phase and join phase of Distributed Bitmap Join decreases continuously while a little bit increase appears in build phase of no-partition hash join For join phase of our algorithm the running time decrease is due to the utilization of intermediate results which reduces both computation cost and communication cost of join operations while the decrease for build phase can be attributed to the reuse of various structures e.g the bitmaps and dictionaries As long as one join operation between relation and relation has been done there is no need for creating dictionaries and bitmaps any more Thus the amortization of computation cost in build phase leads to a relative high performance overall Moreover the increase in build phase of no-partition hash join is because relation is larger than relation  Fig 3 shows the execution time of both algorithms when different number of threads are used In this experiment there is no change of the size of relations and every relation is divided into equal sized runs among all threads From the gure we can see clearly that the performance of Distributed Bitmap Join becomes worse with increasing thread number while that of no-partition hash join becomes better The performance deterioration in join phase of Distributed Bitmap Join is due to the increase in communication cost Since the communication cost is  increase in causes increase in communication cost The degradation in build phase on the other hand can be attributed to the increasing computation cost when creating bitmaps and dictionaries Although Distributed Bitmap Join is worse than no-partition hash join in Fig 3 we emphasize here that the focus of our algorithm is the optimization of a group of queries instead of just one single query In fact the major reason for performance degradation of Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm is that it has to build bitmaps and dictionaries for all threads When it comes

to a group of queries this cost can be amortized among all queries and thus optimize the overall performance which was illustrated in Fig 1 The experimental results show that even though Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm is worse than no-partition hash join for one single query it outperforms no-partition hash join for a group of queries In addition because it is not sensitive to data skew problem Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm performs better in this case VI CONCLUSION With the advance in hardware technology as well as growing demands for real-time response for database application IMDB becomes the central focus in this eld Because of its architectural advantages NUMA which is designed for multi-core system such that each processor accesses its local memory faster than shared memory effectively solves the memory-access related starvation problem In this paper we propose a Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm which aims at optimizing join one of the most expensive operations in database applications by reducing the communication cost and reusing of intermediate results The comparison with nopartition hash join shows that our method outperforms the competitor in terms of execution time for a group of queries The performance also improves with the increase of overlap ratio of query set This work is partially supported by Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project No B412 National Science Foundation of China under grunt No.61003069 No.61033007 and No.60925008 National 973 program under grant No.2010CB731402 R EFERENCES  S Ne gash Business intelligence

  9 example, when plotting the values of a parameter, it is possible to display the histogram chart of the same parameter on the same period of time, or to select one telemetry occurrence and display the corresponding time on a synoptic, or on a planisphere, etc IMIS Smartphone application IMIS is also an application that runs on any Android compatible platforms whether a smartphone or a tablet. It communicates with the same server than the rich client application to retrieve the information to display The IMIS smartphone application is mainly designed for oncall operations and therefore only contains a subset of the IMIS functionalities. The most important function with regard to on-call operations is the management of alarms Thanks to the native notification system available on Android, IMIS can warn users when a new alarm have been detected. The phone \(or tablet\ibrates and emits a beep until the user views the alarm. Users can then display any details about the alarm \(telemetry parameter in alarm monitoring rule that is transgressed, start date, etc.\hen the cause of the alarm is identified, users can acknowledge it from the smartphone In order to help users analyzing the alarm, IMIS provides a very convenient function: the plot of telemetry parameters over a configurable period of time. Not only can users plot the parameter in alarm, but up to four parameters can be displayed simultaneously on the same graph or on separate graphs. The list of available parameters is defined in the satellite database that is retrieved from the server An other interesting feature allows user to display the satellite ground track at the same period of an alarm, using the Google Map application provided with the Android system Finally, thanks to the Andro\357d native SMS and mail applications, IMIS can send messages with valuable information about the alarm: text, alarm details, screenshots of charts, etc A set of screenshots of IMIS Smartphone application is provided in Figure 5  5  IMIS  D ESIGN  Client / server architecture for desktop application The IMIS client / server architecture is a Service Oriented Architecture. It ensures flexibility \(services are independent of each other\d adaptability to changes thanks to the clear separation between the business logic and the \221services\222 interface layer. New services can then be implemented to meet specific requirements of a space mission without strong modification of the IMIS architecture or impact on other missions   Figure 5. IMIS Android application 


  10 In IMIS software, the communication layer is implemented by a component named \221channel\222. The channel defines the services with their input and output data \(i.e. the API of the communication layer\he channel also provides an implementation of the communication layer that is described here-after Different modes of interactions between the clients and the server are implemented. With asynchronous services the service invocation is not blocking. This interaction mode is extended to deal with operations such as \221Progress\222 enabling to continuously receive the results as work progresses on the server side Synchronous services are characterized by the client invoking a service and then waiting for a response to the request. Because the client suspends its own processing after making its service request, synchronous services are suited when the service can process the request in a short time or when a small amount of data is returned. Finally, a last interaction mode is implemented to manage notifications from the server to one or more clients. The clients first subscribe to one or several events. When such an event occurs, the server notifies the client These three interaction modes highlight the exchange of data that are initiated by the client \(synchronous and asynchronous calls\y the server \(asynchronous callbacks and notifications\ever, the technical solution must also take into account the following security constraints: the link between the clients and the server shall be able to pass through firewalls and proxies that only allow HTTP connection and the communication shall be initiated by the client As a consequence, the channel is implemented using RPC Remote Procedure Call\digm with two transport-layer protocols 200  Java RMI \(Remote Method Invocation\: this implementation is convenient for IMIS deployment in an Intranet that allows the transfer of Java serialized objects 200  HTTP-Tunneling RMI: the Java serialized objects are encapsulated in an HTTP request / response so that they can be transferred over the Internet The principle of the HTTP tunnel, pictured in Figure 6  consists in inserting an HTTP relay to route the RMI traffic via HTTP POST requests. The relay is a Java Servlet container \(e.g. Apache Tomcat\at receives RMI requests and transfers them to the RMI server. A variant of this approach is to integrate RMI services directly in the Servlet container in order to improve performance on the encoding and network traffic    Figure 6. HTTP tunneling Finally, because only the clients are able to initiate the communication, the notification mechanism used for example to notify clients when new alarms are raised, is the following: the client frequently queries the server to know if any new event has occurred  Client / server architecture for smartphone client The IMIS smartphone client is an Android application written in Java. Note that in the Android platform, there is no Java Virtual Machine: Java classes are compiled into Dalvik executables and run on Dalvik which is a specialized virtual machine designed specifically for Android Unfortunately, all the Java API is not supported by Dalvik in particular Java RMI can not be used Another transport layer has then been set-up to make the communication between IMIS server and smartphone client possible, as depicted in Figure 7 The services are implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST Representational State Transfer\EST is a style of software architecture for distributed systems in which all services are defined as resources that can be accessed via HTTP methods \(GET, PUT, POST and DELETE\The resources are thus identified by their URI \(which enables to access the service\nd the internet media type of the data transferred \(e.g. XML, JSON\. IMIS uses the JSON format which is less verbose than XML. This is a very important criterion because data are transferred through the mobile network that has a limited bandwidth \(in theory 2 Mbits/s but in practice around 400 Kbits/s Moreover, in REST architectures, the services are stateless between requests. It means that the services do not carry any session state on behalf of the clients that are not currently in the process of making requests. All information about the session state must then be transmitted each time a request is made. One example of this point in IMIS is the session ID that is provided when a user is connected \(with its login password\he session ID is first retrieved by calling the authentication service and then transferred as a parameter of all subsequent requests \(such as the retrieval of telemetry values Another point that is not directly related to REST architecture is the way IMIS is notified when new alarms occur. Even if Google provides a framework named Cloud 


  11 to Device Messaging \(C2DM\ieve this goal, IMIS does not use it. On the one hand, for satellite on-call operations, CNES does not want to be dependent of a thirdparty that is not clearly committed to a certain level of quality of service. On the other hand, CNES does not want to provide any third-party with information about the monitoring and health status of the satellites it operates The notification mechanism that is implemented is thus a frequent query of the server to know if any new alarm has raised. The frequency can be tuned to avoid a huge number of connections limiting the available bandwidth and the battery life 6  T ECHNOLOGIES  Java is the programming language selected for developing IMIS because of the IMIS di stributed architecture and the complexity of the IMIS GUI. Java applications can run on any Java Virtual Machine regardless of the computer architecture. Java is also the language for developing on Android platform. Finally Java development environment offers a great number of APIs \(Application Programming Integrated Development Environment frameworks and a continuous integration environment. One particular API that is used in IMIS is Java RMI Remote Method Invocation\ which enables to create distributed Java technology-based applications, in which the methods of remote Java objects can be invoked from other Java virtual machines, possibly on different hosts. Java RMI is the technology used to implement the IMIS channel PostgreSQL is the object-relational database management system used to store all persistent information of IMIS except telemetry parameters values which, for performance reasons, are stored in binary files using a CNES proprietary technology named \223 TelemetryTable 224. The principle of the 223TelemetryTable\224 is to store the telemetry covering a specified period \(typically one day\ in a binary file with an extensible time index. Each file is self sufficient in the sense that it includes a description of its own data dictionary necessary to read / write the data blocks. The advantages of this binary structure that is temporally indexed are its minimum disk space footprint \(data are not encoded in ASCII\d the optimal performance for inserting and retrieving data on a time criterion IMIS desktop application It remains to present the technology best suited to implement the GUI of IMIS rich client application. Swing naturally comes to mind as this technology is an integral part of the standard Java API. But an interesting alternative was chosen: the Standard Widget Toolkit \(SWT\ and more specifically the EclipseRCP technology \(based on SWT and JFace\eRCP technology enables developers to implement with a good productivity, highly interactive and user-friendly applications. Indeed, the Eclipse framework provides a very mature architecture with reusable components and standard user interactions \(such as drag and drop, windows docking, online help etc.\The architecture is based on plugins that can be made available gradually throughout the development phase. Moreover, as a generic tool IMIS has to take into account the specificities of every mission it operates and the modular architecture of EclipseRCP offered the possibility to add or remove plug-ins depending on the user requirements To illustrate the architecture based on reusable components we can mention the integration of four components in the IMIS client 200  BIRT is an open source Eclipse-based reporting system that IMIS uses to produce health reports  200  CSS is an integrated control system based on the Eclipse environment. IMIS uses CSS to display and animate synoptics 200  uDig is an open source desktop application framework built with EclipseRCP. The goal of uDig is to provide a complete Java solution for desktop GIS data access editing, and viewing. uDig is used as a plug-in in IMIS to display a map with the satellite ground tracks and stations  200  JFreeChart is a free Java chart library that makes it easy for developers to display professional quality charts in their applications. JFreeChart is compatible with both Swing and SWT making it possible to integrate into an EclipseRCP application [12   If the use of COTS dramatically reduces the development cost of a new software, it is often necessary to optimize the integrated library in order to fit the end users need. For instance, in IMIS development,  a particular attention was paid on optimizing JFreeChart performances IMIS smartphone application With regard to the smartphone part of the software, it was a good opportunity to check the capabilities of mobile platforms to develop a professional application. On the one hand all features necessary to the smartphone development were available and well-functioning on the Android platform. But on the other hand, it should be noted that the development faced a rapid evolution of the Android operating system two major releases within 6 months Fi g ure 7. IMIS smart p hone communication 


  12 Moreover no mature chart API was found even though a beta version of a library named aFreeChart was used successfully and works pretty well Finally, the Google Map application provided with the Android system was used to display the satellite ground track 7  C ONCLUSION  The development of IMIS server and desktop client ended in November 2011. Since late 2011, IMIS has been deployed in the MSL payload control center and has been integrated into SSALTO. Operators, science teams, and experts from CNES and French/American laboratories involved in the MSL project have a very good feeling about the software IMIS meet the requirements of two different missions \(Earth observation and Mars exploration\ that at a first glance are supposed to have distinct operational procedures to monitor the instruments. This was possible because IMIS was designed as a generic software that provides the base functionalities and an extensible architecture MICROSCOPE and SWOM are the next missions that intend to use IMIS in their payload control centers [13   Technologies and software design concepts are now mature and allow to implement distributed Web architecture. In terms of information system security, no specific difficulty was encountered. The lessons learnt are to consider upstream the security constraints. In most of cases it is sufficient to apply the state of the art in matter of security network segmentation and isolation, system hardening, and application security \(use of security guidelines and best practices from CNES and partners: authentication, traces and security logs, restricted privileges, input/output data checking, etc The smartphone application is currently in the last stages of development. A prototype was developed in 2011 and presented to end-users. It has validated the operators\222 interest in a mobile application that allows to remotely monitor the payload instruments. IMIS android application has raised a lot of interest and its use is now being considered for the MSL mission IMIS offers new functionalities and possibilities for on-call operations that have been requested by operators for a long time. However, as it is not yet used in an operational context, there is currently no lesson learnt about the real advantage of using such a tool.  Moreover, the deployment of the smartphone client requires further analyses: definition of security procedures relative to professional usage of smartphones, modification of the operational procedures because the way on-call operations are realized, is modified with such an interactive tool that provides means to remotely analyze and acknowledge alarms, etc R EFERENCES    Wi en s et al 2012  T h e C h e m C a m I n s t r u m e n t Su i t e  on the Mars Science Laboratory \(MSL\Rover: Body Unit and Combined System Tests.
