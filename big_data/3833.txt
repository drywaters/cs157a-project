Boolean Matrix based approach has been employed to generate frequent itemsets in multidimensional transaction databases. It adopts Boolean relational calculus to discover frequent predicate sets. When using this algorithm first time, it scans the database once and will generate the association rules Apriori property is used in algorithm to prune the item sets. It is not necessary to scan the database again; it uses Boolean logical operations to generate the association rules. We illustrate the implementati on of algorithm with the help of a simple example Keywords- Boolean matrix; hybrid dimensional association rule relational calculus; multidimensional transaction  database  I  I NTRODUCTION  Mining association rules in transactional or relational database is an important task in data mini  The association rules are for discovering the interesting association relationships among huge amounts of business transaction records An association rule is an implication of the form A  B where A  I  B  I and A  B   The rule A  B holds in the transaction set D with support s where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A  B i.e., the union of sets A and B or say, both A and B This is taken to be the probability P  A  B The rule A  B has confidence c in the transaction set D where c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B This is taken to be the conditional probability P  B  A That is      B A P B A Support          A B P B A Confidence    Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold min sup minimum confidence threshold min conf re called strong T he support defined in the equation given below is referred to relative support whereas the occurrence frequency is called the absolute suppor e set  o f  frequent k itemsets is commonly denoted by L K            A Support B A Support A B P B A Confidence      Association rule mining can be viewed as a two-step process 1. Find all frequent itemsets: Each of these itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a predetermined minimum support count min sup  2  Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets: These rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence min_conf   Among them searching for frequent itemsets is the key step Because its easy to generate rules from frequent itemsets R Agrawal  and some others  presented the algorithm for mining the simplest form of association rules   The Apriori algorithm proposed by R. Agrawal and R Srikant [2   Apriori e m ploy s a n iterativ e app r o ach kn own as a level-wise search, where k itemsets are used toexplore  k 1\-itemsets. Apriori principle: If an itemset is requent then all of its subsets must also be frequent. It works in two steps Join Step C k is generated by joining L k-1 with itself  Prune Step Any \(k-1\mset that is not frequent cannot be a subset of a frequent k-itemset  C k Candidate itemset of size k and L k frequent itemset of size k  Moreover, it is necessary to repeatedly scan the database for finding frequent itemsets. Therefore the run-time of the Apriori will increase by index grade with the increase of transaction item quantity Association rules can be classified as single-dimensional association rules and multidimensional association rules on the basis of dimension appearing in rules. In multidimensional databases, we refer to each distinct predicate in a rule as a dimension. Hence, we can refer to buys \(X Digital camera    buys \(X, HP Printer is a single dimensional or intra-dimensional association rule because it contains a single distinct predicate \(e.g buys th multiple occurrences \(i.e., the predicate occurs more than once within the rule\ion rules that involve two or more dimensions or predicates can be referred to as multidimensional association rules age\(X , "20    occupation \(X , "student    buys \(X , "laptop  contains three predicates age, occupation and buys h of which occurs only once in the rule. Hence, we say that it has no repeated Mul ti d i m e n s i o na l association rules with no repeated predicates are called inter-dimensional association rules. We can also mine multidimensional association rules with repeated predicates which contain multiple occurrences of some predicates These rules are called hybrid-dimensional association rules Volumn 2  978-1-4244-5586-7/10/$26.00      2010 IEEE C 


 645 In this the mining of single-dimensional association rule and non-repetitive predicate multi-dimensional association rule are integrated. We propose an algorithm for mining of hybrid-dimensional association rule using Boolean matrix  It mines hybrid-dimension association rules from multidimensional transaction database. We  set definite condition that restricts to the hybrid-dimension association rules mined When we design the hybrid dimension association rule mining algorithm, we stress on the extension and improvement of the Apriori Algorithm the simple Single-dimensional mining algorithm. Therefore, the following text will give a brief analysis to the Apriori II  T HE APRIORI ALGORITHM  The classical Apriori algorithm  em plo y an iter ative method to find all the freq uent iemsets. First, the frequent 1itemsets L 1  is found according to the user-specified minimum support threshold, then the L 1  is used to find frequent 2-iemsets L 2  and so on, until there is no new frequent itemsets could be found. After finding all the frequent itemsets using Apriori, we could generate the corresponding association rules, according to the second step in the process of association rules mining Thus we find the association relationships among transaction items [1 The conditional restrict is: in the rules, the predicates represent the main attribute \(the attribute refers to the transaction itemset\ can occur many times, but the other predications refer to subordinate attributes \(some other relevant attributes\ once [6 o re to achieve our aim, we design an algorithm for mining hybrid-dimension association rules, which meet the definite condition, from multidimensional transaction database III  CONDITIONAL HYBRID DIMENSION ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  The generation of frequent itemsets is the core of all the association rules mining algorithms. Previous studies on mining multi-dimensional association rules we focused on finding non-repetitive predicate multi- dimensional rules We integrate the single-dimensional mining and nonrepetitive predicate multi-dimensional mining, and present a method for mining hybrid-dimensional association rules using Boolean Matrix A  The join process There are two steps in generation of the frequent itemsets and frequent predicate sets. The two steps are joining and  pruning  1\The join generating candidate 2-itemsets C 2    We find frequent 1-itemsest based on each attribute, at the same time we mark items belong to every main attribute So it will be clear that the marked items are the items of main attribute and unmarked items are the subordinate items When we search for C2 if both of the two joining items are marked items, we call the function for intra-dimensional join between the items as well as inter-dimensional join, but only proceed with inter-dimensional join on the other occasions 2\in on other occasions When we generate frequent itemsets directly according to the join mode of the Apriori, it would occur intradimensional join as well as inter-dimensional join. But there are some restrictions to the generation of intradimensional join and inter-dimensional join. Therefore we make the following modifications to the joining step of the Apriori  We assume that items within transaction and itemset are sorted in lexicographic order. We could take two steps to find Lk    Distinguish the intra-dimensional join and interdimensional join; If all the items within the two \(k-1\itemsets  belong to the main attribute; we proceed with intra-dimensional join, and proceed with interdimensional join on other occasions   Implement join L k -1  L k -1   and choose the corresponding  joining condition according to the characteristic of the join \(intra-dimensional join or inter-dimensional join    B  The conditional restriction in hybrid-dimension association rules First the frequent itemsets are obtained, and then we generate the hybrid-dimension association rules from the frequent itemsets. In the process of generating frequent itemsets we make both intra-dimensional join and inter-dimensional join as well as the conditional restrictions while proceeding with join, all of the frequent itemsets have such a character: the values within main attribute field occur many times, while the values within subordinate attribute fields occur only once. Thus the  rules generated by the algorithm may include many predicates, or include the same predicate. So the hybrid dimension association rules are formed IV  DEFINITIONS  A  Association Rules Definition 1  Let I = {i 1 i 2 i 3 i n be a set of items. D is a database of transactions.  Each transaction T is a set of items and has an identifier called TID. Each T    Definition 2   Association rule is the implication of the form A  B where A and B are itemsets which satisfies A  I B  I and A   B   Definitio 3   The strength of an association rule can be measured in terms of its Support and Confidence   A  B is true in D with a support \(denoted by sup and a confidence denoted by conf  where A and B are  set of items. Support sup is a percentage of transactions including both A and B A  B in transaction sets D Confidence conf is a percentage of transactions including both A and  A  B in transactions that contain A  sup P A  B  conf P B  A  P A  B  Definition 4 Boolean Matrix: is a matrix with element 0 or 1 Definition 5 The Boolean AND operation is defined as follows:      0.0=0 0.1=0 1.0=0 1.1=1 Where logical Volumn 2 


 646 implication is denoted by . or AND. If we write C=A.B, then C can be determined by listing all possible combinations of A and B. Truth  table for AND will be  A B C=A.B 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 Definition 6 The Boolean AND calculus is carried out to an arbitrary k columns vector of the Boolean matrix; the sum of 1 of the operation result is called k- support of the k columns vector  Proposition 1   If the sum of 1 in a column vector A i is less than min_sup_num, it is not necessary that A i will attend calculus of the next level supports Rationale  According to the principle of the Boolean AND calculus, the result is 1 when the value of all vector elements \(in a record Proposition 2   Itemset A is a k-itemsets \(each item belongs to different dimension/attribute\L K-1 j\| presents the number of values in a dimension/attribute j in all frequent k-1\itemsets of the frequent set L K-1 There is an item j in X. If  |L K-1 j\s smaller than k-1, itemset X is not a frequent items   V  METHOD  Let D is a multi-dimensional transactional database  m  n  and min_sup is the minimum support of D. The minimum support number min_sup_num can be defined as min_sup_num= min_sup   m [8   Dimensions, which are also called predications, attributes or fields, constitute a dimension combination with a formula d  d  dn  in which  dj represents  j dimension The i  record can be expressed as value combination with a formula vi vi  vin where vij represents j-th value in i-th record    i  m    j   n The form dj vij is called an itemŽ in relational database or other multidimensional data sets, which is denoted by  Iij That is Iij  dj vij  where   i  m    j   n  Among the n attributes, \(n-1\ attributes are subordinate attributes and attribute is the main attribute A set constituted by some item Iij is called itemsetŽ. The itemsetŽ which may consist of the items from subordinate attributes or main attribute only or from subordinate and main attributes The Boolean AND operation is carried out to an arbitrary n column vector of the Boolean matrix; the sum of 1s of the operation result is called n-support of the n column vector VI  ALGORITHM  The algorithm consists of following steps 1  Transforming the multidimensional transaction database into two Boolean matrices one for subordinate attributes \(A m*p and one for main attribute \(A m*q  2  Generating the set of frequent 1-itemset L A1 from the subordinate attributes matrix\ and L B1 from the main attribute matrix 3  Pruning the Boolean matrices 4  Perform AND operations to generate 2-itemsets L A1   L B1 and L A1    L A1 for inter-dimension join and L B1   L B1 for intra-dimension join 5  Repeat the process to generate \(k+1\itemsets from L k  A. Transforming the multidimensional transaction database into Boolean matrix The multidimensional transaction database D has m records and n dimensions. Each dimension has different value combinations or categories. To extract such patterns from the database, the categorical and symmetric binary attributes are transformed into items  This ty pe  of  transformation can be performed by creating a new item for each distinct attribute-value pair. Then association rule mining algorithm can be applied. If there are k value combinations in a dimension then k\(k-1\/2 binary items will be created We set up separate Boolean matrix for subordinate attributes and main attribute. A Boolean matrix A m*p which has m \(records or transactions\rows and p \(for \(n-1 subordinate attributes values\ columns and another Boolean matrix B m*q which has m \(records or transactions\ rows and q \(for \(n th main attributes values\ columns. For each transaction in subordinate attributes matrix, only one category of each dimension contains the value 1, rest will contain 0. Whereas in main attribute matrix there can be more than one category have value 1 in a transaction  B.  Generating the frequent 1-itemset L 1 The Boolean matrices A m*p and B m*q are scanned and support numbers of all dimension values are computed. The Support number I j Sup_num,  of I j is the number of 1s in the j th column of the Boolean matrix. If I j sup_num is smaller than min_sup_num, itemset I j is not a frequent 1-itemset and the j th column will be deleted from the matrix  Otherwise itemset I j is the frequent 1-itemset and is added to frequent one itemset list L 1   C.  Pruning the Boolean matrix  P runing the Boolean matrix means deleting some columns from it. This is described in detail as: Let I be the set of all items in the frequent set   L K-1 where k>2 Compute all     |L K-1 j\| where j  I, and delete the column of correspondence item j if |L K-1 j\| is smaller than min_sup_num  D. Generating the set of frequent k-itemsets L k Frequent k-itemsets are discovered by AND relational calculus, which is carried out for the k-vectors combination If the Boolean matrix A p*q has q columns where 2 n and min_sup_num is  h pm, \(C q  k combinations of k-vectors will be produced. The AND relational calculus is for each Volumn 2 


 647 combination of k-vectors. If the sum of elements values in the AND calculation result is not smaller than the minimum support number min_sup_num the k-itemsets corresponding to this combination of k-vectors are the frequent k-itemsets and are added to the set of frequent kitemsets L k The rules generated from the algorithm may include many predicates, or include the same predicate. So the hybrid dimension association rules are formed VII   I LLUSTRATIVE E XAMPLE  We integrate the single-dimensional mining and nonrepetitive predicate multi-dimensional mining, and present a method for mining hybrid- dimensional association rules using Boolean Matrix Let a multi-dimensional transaction database Order which includes two subordinate attributes Age and Income and one main attribute Ordered_items as given below TABLE II. ORDER               In order to simplify the implement process, we preprocessed some attributes before algorithm executes, shown below TABLE III. Mapping Age TABLE IV. Mapping Income  TABLE V.  ORDER             The multidimensional transaction table Order is transformed into two Boolean Matrices: A m*p as subordinate attributes matrix and B m*q as main attribute matrix. Which are as given below Let the minimum support is 0.4; m=10 is the number of transactions. Therefore min_sup_num=10  0.4=4.0. We compute the sum of the elements value of each column in the Boolean matrix A 10*5 and B 10*5 set of frequent 1-itemset is :    L A1 y},{m},{h},{l}},  L B1 I1},{I2},{I3},{I5 smaller than the minimum support number. Now we perform the AND operation to join L A1 and L B1 according to the type of join\ to generate L 2  The possible 2-itemsets  are Inter-dimensional join \(L A1   L B1 and L A1    L A1  It is performed by AND operation among the columns of Matrix A m*p AND B m*q and A m*p AND A m*p Intra-dimensional join \(L B1  L B1   It is performed by AND operation among the columns of Matrix B m*p AND B m*q The possible 2-itemsets from L A1 and L B1 l,2 m,3\\(m,5 I1,I2\\(I1,I3\\(I1,I5\,\(I2,I3\,\(I2,I5\\(I3,I5 After performing   AND  operation to get the support numbers of these mentioned item sets the Boolean matrices A 10*18 and B 10*6 are generated Now again we compute the sum of the columns of matrices A 10*18 and B 10*6 And prune the columns of the 2-itemsets those are not frequent. Same process will be repeated till for next higher itemsets  Figure 1. shows the process of searching for frequent itemsets in detail. In the figure, we pruned the candidates generated in each level. For each generated frequent itemset, we find that it should meet the characteristics of the frequent itemsets that are generated by hybrid-dimension association rules mining algorithm Therefore, we can easily generate corresponding hybriddimension association rules from the frequent itemsets generated by the algorithm. For example:  In figure 8, {m, h I1, I2:4} is a frequent itemset. We can generate such a hybrid-dimension association rule  2 1 I I h m    Support=40% and Confidence=100  Figure 1.

 648 hybrid-dimension association rules on multidimensional transaction database by means of the Boolean Matrix Based algorithm VIII  EXPERIMENT  To test whether the proposed method is fast, expansible and effective our experiments are made on machine with Intel\(R\ Core 2Duo, 1.5GHz and 1GB memory. The operating system is Windows XP. We use a database that has 500 records and 5 attributes, which have 2~8 different values/categories  Fig 2. Execution Time with different record numbers  IX   RESULT  AND  DISCUSSION The confidence of association rules has a specific meaning when the antecedent of the rule is satisfied, the consequent of the rule will have c here c refers to the confidence of the rule\ossibility of being satisfied. In association rules only in the antecedent part of multidimensional association rules include several predictions at the same time. We can say that the result of prediction on multidimensional association rules is better and more precise than on singledimensional association rules. For example, TABLEI presents a multidimensional transaction database Order If we make a single dimensional association analysis on the predicate Ordered_items which presents itemsets in transaction, the result of analysis will only include the relevance of Order itemsets. But  if we make a hybriddimension association analysis, the result of analyzing not only includes the relevance of Order itemsets, but also includes the relevance of customers information, eg Age Income Thus when we proceed with predictions on the product order of customers by means of the result of association analysis, obviously, the conditions included in the antecedent of multidimensional association rules is more abundant, and will bring better prediction result X    CONCLUSION The proposed algorithm uses Boolean matrix and meet the definite condition to generate conditional-hybrid dimensional association rules, from multidimensional transactional database. The main features are: it scans the database only once, it does not generate the candidate item sets, and it uses the Boolean vector relational calculusŽ to generate frequent item sets. It stores data in the form of bits so it needs less memory space and can be applied to large relational databases. T he further work is to optimize the algorithm, and increase the efficiency of the algorithm  R EFERENCES  1  R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A. Swami.

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
