Abstract Finding frequent patterns from databases has been the most researched topic in association-rule mining Business-Intelligence using data-mining has felt an increased thrust for real-time frequent pattern mining algorithms finding huge dem and from numerous realtime business applications like e-commerce recommender-systems, group-decision-supportsystems, supply-chain-management, to name a few Last decade has seen development of mind-whelming algorithms, among which, vertical-mining algorithms have been found to be very effective. However, with dense-datasets, the perform ances of these algorithms significantly degrade. Moreover, these algorithms are not suited to respond to the real-time need. In this paper, we describe BDFS\(b an algorithm to perform real-time frequent pattern mining using diffsets and using an intelligent staged search technique by-passing usual breadth-first and depth-first searchtechniques. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithm can make a fair estima tion of the probable frequent-patterns reacting to the user-defined time bound and reaches some of the longest frequent patterns much faster tha n the existing algorithms 1. Introduction In recent years, analysis of historic data is being used by Business-Intelligence syste ms for getting deeper insights into various busin ess areas, thus playing a key role in fine-tuning business goals such as improving customer retention, market penetration profitability and efficiency. Frequent pattern mining for large databases of business data, such as transaction records is of great interest in data mining and knowledge  since its incep tion in 1993, by Agrawal et al. Researchers have generally focused on the frequent pattern mining, as it is complex and the search space needed for finding all frequent itemsets is huge  A num b er of efficie n t algorithm s have bee n proposed in the last few years to make this search fast and acc ong thes e, a num ber of effective vertical mining algorithms have been recently proposed, that usually outperforms horizontal approaches pite many adva ntages of the vertical format, the methods tend to suffer, when the tid-list cardinality gets very large as in the case of dense datasets Again, su ccessful algorithms in this area have limited themselves to either breadth first or depth first search techniques. Hence, most of the algorithms stop only after finding the exhaustive optimal\quent itemsets and do not promise to run under user defined real-time constraints and produce some satisficing \(i nteresting sub-optimal solutions due to their limiting characteristics[4 Implementing BDFS\(b\ith  Diff-Sets for Real-Time Frequent Pattern Mining in Dense Datasets \205 First Findings Rajanish Dass     Ambuj Mahanti Indian Institute of Management Calcutta rajanish@iimcal.ac.in  am@iimcal.ac.in In this paper, we describe BDFS\(b\s adopted from re al-tim e freque nt pattern mining algorithm which runs under  limited execution time and has the capability of running under limited memory as well. BDFS\(b iff-sets does not limit itself to either of breadth-first or a depth-first search, but uses a search technique which is a good mix of the staged search and depth-first search discussed later in section 4.1 adopted from 6  We have a d opted t he diff-sets concept as introduc ed it has bee n found to be very effective in cases of dense datasets but show that using a combination of BDFS\(b\d diff-sets, for finding frequent patterns from dense databases becomes much more effective In this paper we also show the edge of BDFS\(b diff-sets over existing eff icient association mining algorithms such as Apriori 7 FP-Gro wt h [8 Eclat   all these a l gorithm s used have been implemented in enhanced and optimized way available in public domain as has been referred later and discuss  h en it runs to com pletion a nd outputs exhaustive set of frequent patterns We have intentionally not compared the real-time output of these algorithms with BDFS\(b\ff-sets as these existing algorithms are not meant for real-time output and hence we decided not to compare them in a Proceedings of the 2005 International Works hop on Ubiquitous Data Management \(UDM\22205 0-7695-2411-7/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


dimension for which they we re not made, even for the sake of academic curiosity 1  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present some pertinent business issues of real-time frequent pattern mining in brief. In Section 3, we discuss a review of the previous work in association rule mining. In Section 4, we introduce algorithm BDFS\(b\-diff-sets implemented using diff c o ntains t h e empirical evaluation of our algorithm. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6 2. Pertinent Issues in Business There are numerous areas where real-time decision making plays a critical role. One such area is real-time recommender system. The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce have led to the development of recommender systems  e CRM. In particular  Schafer et al a de an elegant s u rvey on m a jor existing systems and approaches to e-commerce recommendation. Despite the popularity of the recommender systems, they have a number of limitations related to their scalability and real-time performance. As a typical example, the SmartPad system develope  m a kes  recommendations using a model of association rules The model is built on the past eight weeks of data from Safeway Stores and is up dated weekly or quarterly to reflect seasonal differences. Hence, Shen  observes that most existi ng data mining approaches to e-commerce recommendation are past data modelbased in the sense that they first build a preference model from a past dataset an d then apply the model to current customer situations. Such approaches are not suitable for applications where fresh data should be collected and processed instantly since it reflects changes to customer preferences over some products There are numerous other areas where real-time decision making becomes important. These include areas like real-time customer relationship management  im e supply chain m a nagem ent system s 17] \(especially with the adven t of RFID technology real-time enterprise risk and vulnerability management  e stock m a nagem ent and ve ndor inve  real-tim e oper ational m a nagem ent with special applications in mission critical real-time information as is used in the airlines industry, real-time intrusion and real-time fra ud detection real-tim e negotiations and other areas like real-time dynamic pricing and discount offe ring to customers in real-time 1 The authors may be contacted for the results of the realtime output of the existing algorithms More than that, real-time data mining will have tremendous importance in areas where a real-time decision can make the difference between life and death \205 mining patterns in medical systems 3.

Thus in this algorithm we introduce a new search strategy, not limiting ourselves to breadthfirst or depth-first search only, keeping in mind that both breadth-first and depth-first search techniques have their own limitations BDFS\(b\s the given search space in stages. The search is conducted in a depth first manner which ensures that patterns of greater length will be preferred over those of comparatively shorter lengths We assume that a lower triangular frequency matrix M for a given database is created in a supportindependent pre-processing step and kept in the harddisk, which stores the sup port independent frequencies of all 1-length and 2-length patterns. Once the user specifies a desired support valu e, all frequent patterns of length 1 and 2 \(meaning 2\, where F\(n means frequent pattern of length-n\re obtained from M. Then BDFS\(b\ts starts its search for frequent patterns of higher lengths from this point forward by intersecting the diff-sets of corresponding items. The most salient features of BDFS\(b\ff-sets are :\(a\onducts search in stages and uses backtracking strategy to run to completion and ensure optimal solution. \(b\ It takes a block of candidate patterns b from a global pool, conducts the search by checking the frequency of these patterns in the database.

Merge newly found klength frequent patterns with previously found k-length frequent patterns to make patterns of higher length Newly merged patterns \(4  acde ,bcde 203\203\(11 The number of frequent immediate subsets of acde and bcde are 3 and 2 respectively.

In the next section, we show and discuss this effect. BDFS\(b\-diffsets has the capability to run in real-ti me. Whenever it is stopped before its natur al completion, it outputs frequent patterns of various lengths it had obtained up to that point of execution time 5. Empirical Evaluations Legend T= Average size of transaction; I= Average size of the maximal potentially large itemset; D= No of transactions in the database; N= Number of items To evaluate the performance of BDFS\(b with on dense datasets, we have tested it on various dense datasets. This includes real-life dense datasets like CHESS, Connect-4, PUMSB and PUMSB 2 and synthetic datasets like: T10I8D100K, T10I8D10K T10I8D1K \(N=1K\These datasets were generated using the IBM synthetic data generator 3  The  experiments were performed on a Red-Hat Linux machine with 1GB RAM and 20 GB HD with Pentium IV 2.24Ghz processor 5.1. Comparison of BDFS\(b existing algorithms In order to show how BDFS b\ff-sets performs on dense datasets, when it is run to generate all frequent patterns, we have chosen to compare it with dEclat 4  Eclat 5 FP-growth 6 and Apriori 7 Since FP-growth is known to be an order faster and scales better than  have com pared Apriori and BDFS\(b diff-sets but for their number of patterns checked. In figures 5 6, and 7, we have compared the run-time of FP-Growth, dEclat and Eclat with BDFS\(b\s for T10I8D100K and Pumsb* respectively and found that BDFS\(b\iff-sets significantly out-performs all 2 These datasets are publicly available at http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data 3 The data generator is available from http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest//syndata.html#assocSynData 4 The dEclat code used for comparison is publicly available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/goethals/software/index.html 5 The Eclat code used for comparison is publicly available at http://fuzzy.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~borgelt/eclat.html 6 The FP-growth code used for comparison is publicly available at www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~kdd/program.html 7 The Apriori code used for comparison is publicly available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/goethals/software/index.html Proceedings of the 2005 International Works hop on Ubiquitous Data Management \(UDM\22205 0-7695-2411-7/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


the three algorithms in these cases. It is noteworthy at this point that BDFS\(b\ff-sets using the staged search technique performs better than dEclat, ,which uses the diff-sets along with a depth-first search technique. In figure 8, we have tested the scalability of FP-Growth and BDFS\(b becomes a major concern for vertical mining algorithms in dense datasets We have observed that all the algorithms are scalable with time and number of transactions in the datab ase, but BDFS\(b\ff-sets takes strikingly much less time than FP-Growth over the same databases. Comparing the number of patterns being checked by Apriori and BDFS\(b\, as shown in figure 9, it is found that BDFS\(b\iff-sets checks much lesser number of patterns than Apriori The performance imperatives come from the block depth first search strategy that BDFS\(b\ff-sets utilize and combines th e power of the diff-sets approach. It is worth-mentioning at this point that even Eclat and dEclat uses a pre-processing step to gather counts of all 2 sequences above the given support threshold howe ve r we us e a support-independent preprocessing step to create a matrix \(as detailed above e time to calculate patterns till length-2 from the matrix. Again, the versions of Apriori, FP-growth and o ther algorithms used for comparison use a number of optimization techniques as discussed in 2  to the ext ent that he A p ri ori c ode used uses a trie datastructure instead of the original hash-tree implementation as discussed by [7 and even by-passes counting 2-length patterns found to be its main bottleneck We believe that implementing all these optimizations in BDFS\(b will enhance its performance more 5.2. Real-Time Performance of BDFS\(b sets Figures 10 and 11 summarizes the real-time behavior of BDFS\(b\diff-sets by de picting the percentage of frequent patterns generated with percentage execution time having F\(1 F\(2\uded and excluded in two respective curves. This we have done to show how the real-time performance is affected by the twodimensional matrix M. It may be noted that the over all percentage of output is almost always ahead of percentage execution time In figure 10 we find out that we have approximate ly 60% of the frequent patterns in 36% of completion time. In figure 12, we observe that our proposed algorithm perform quite well on real-life dense dataset connect-4. Figure 12 makes a tabular presentation of re al-time outputs showing length-wise frequent patterns border sets, and candidate sets, at different time slices \(expressed as of total execution time may be seen from the output  which are of m a xi m a l length i n this case\sets is done in 50 o f the tota l execution time, a large portion of  s om e  p atterns as well were outpu tted in early phases of total execution time Although it can be argued that all the existing frequent pattern mining algorithms will give some output if the execution is stopped at a user-defined time, but we have found th at their performance in the real-time output is not promising as they use either a breadth-first or a depth-first search only and do not try to promise real-time performance As mentioned we are not showing their real-time output firstly as we do not want to compare them in dimensions for which they were not meant and secondly due to lack sufficient space 6. Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm BDFS\(b\diff-sets fro frequent pattern mining in dense datasets, that uses a brute fo rce version of the Block Depth First Search\(BDFS 6 and im plem ented wit h  ve com p ared the perform ance of BDFS\(b\ w ith dEclat, Eclat, FP-Growth and Apriori and shown that it compares well with others. Moreover by adjusting its block size properly BDFS\(b\iff-sets has the extra ability to run with limited available memory which often becomes a point of concern in other algorithms \(we intend to show the results fo limited memory performance in an extended paper  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 0.33 1.00 3 5 Support Time\(s FP-Growth BDSF\(b\iffsets Figure 5 Time comparison of FP-Growth with BDFS\(b diff-sets for T10I8D100K, b=100K.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
