Mining Top-k Faul t Tolerant Association Rules by Redundant Pattern Disambiguation in Data Streams You Yuyang, Zhang Jianpei College of Computer Science and Technology Harbin Engineering University Harbin, HLJ, P.

China arthurxl@sina.com Abstract The real-world data may be usually polluted by uncontrolled factors or contained with noisy. Fault-tolerant frequent pattern can overcome this problem. It may express more generalized information than frequent pattern which is 
absolutely matched. The present research is integrated with previous research into an integrity new method, called TopNFTDS, to discover fault-tolerant association rules over stream. It can discover top-k true fault-tolerant rules without minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold specified by user. We extend the negative itemsets to fault-tolerant space and disambiguate redundant patterns by this algorithm. Experiment results show that the developed algorithm is an efficient method for mining top-k fault-tolerant association rules in data streams Keywords-negative itemset; top-k fault tolerant association rule; redundant pattern; data stream I   I NTRODUCTION  A data stream is a massive, ordered sequence of data 
elements continuously generation at a rapid rate Association rules mining in data stream environment is a major application of data stream mining. The research of mining top-k fault tolerant frequent patterns in data streams has been carried out. Here, we propose an effective algorithm, called Top-NFTDS, to disambiguate fault tolerant redundant pattern generated by Top-FTDS algorithm. The next process is constructing the fault tolerant association rule from the fault tolerant frequent patterns with confidence. There is the association rule if one has three out of four or even two out of four symptoms coughing, fever, a headache, and a sore throat, then a doctor will diagnose one catching a cold but need not get all these symptoms at the same time [1   It is ca lle d  th e  fault tolerant association rule. Association rules are defined 
as the form X 001 Y where X and Y are frequent itemsets. Not all association rules with high support and confidence are significant. First, much of the information is probably inevitable, or is to be expected. Second, the information expressed by association rules may be invalid. Finally, the information expressed by association rules may be repeated. Therefore, help users to discover useful knowledge, we need to use a variety of techniques to effectively reduce the large number of redundant patterns Currently, most researches of the association rule mining are based on the support and confidence framework and they focus on mining positive association rule. In practice, negative association rules also hide some useful information [2  Neg a tiv e ass o c i at io n ru l e s a r e  
defined as the form X 001  Y  X 001 Y and X 001  Y where X  and Y are frequent itemsets [3  A n e g a tiv e p a tt ern  describes the negative relationships between the itemsets Using statistical information of negative patterns and positive patterns, Top-NFTDS negate  lots of redundant patterns. Comparing with traditional static databases, data streams are continuous, unbounded, usually flowing with high speed and the data elements are not necessarily uniformly distributed. Since complexity of time and space of the algorithm has very stringent restrictions mining in data stream. Top-NFTDS algorithm adopts discovered fault tolerant frequent patterns to calculate the negative 
patterns but not rediscover the negative patterns. By this strategy, we improve the efficiency of the algorithm greatly In preliminary work, we propose the Top-FTDS algorithm, and it consists of three phases: construction of Top-FTDS-tree phase, reconstruction of Top-FTDS-tree phase and fault-tolerant frequent pattern generation phase The Top-FTDS-tree is an effective data structure. It is developed for maintaining essential information and mining top-k fault-tolerance frequent patterns of data streams within the current sliding window. Implementation procedure of Top-FTDS algorithm is no more repeated here In this paper, an effective algorithm, called TopNFTDS, is designed to generate the fault tolerant association rules of data stream and more importantly to 
disambiguate the redundant patterns at the same time Experiment results show the good effectiveness, the high efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Problem definition is presented in Section 2. Section 3 details the whole Top-NFTDS algorithm and gives detailed algorithm design. The experiment results are shown and discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, we conclude this paper II  P ROBLEM D EFINITION  Association rules are defined as the form X 001 Y where X and Y are fault tolerant frequent patterns generated by Top-FTDS algorithm. Unlike traditional association rules in the fault tolerant association rules mining field, support 
of the association rule is fault tolerant support. By allowing the existence of patterns mismatch, fault tolerant pattern must be with the higher value of fault tolerant support and the lower value of confidence of fault tolerant rules. A fault tolerant association rule is an expression X  FTS 001 FTC Y where FTS is fault tolerant support of the fault tolerant rule. It is the joint probability of a transaction fault tolerant containing both X and Y denoted as supp  X 001 Y C is fault tolerant confidence of the fault tolerant rule. It is the conditional probability of a transaction that

the transaction contains Y given it contains X denoted as conf  X 000 Y 4   if the itemset X 001 Y is frequent, the rule is frequent, i.e supp  X 001 Y  0011 minimum support. A rule is confident if conf  X 000 Y  0011 minimum confidence, where minimum confidence is a value specified by us T o pFT DS algorithm has been successfully discovered top-k fault tolerant frequent patterns in data streams without minimum support threshold specified by user. Similarly Top-NFTDS algorithm dose not predefine the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold and then does not include redundant fault tolerant rules Fault tolerant frequent itemsets have the following three properties, all these properties are the basis of fault tolerant association rules mining algorithm Property 1 Let X  Y are different fault tolerant frequent itemsets, if there exist X 002 Y and then there exist supp  X  003  supp  Y  Property 2 Satisfied with prerequisite of fault tolerance parameter, superset of fault tolerant frequent itemsets may be fault tolerant frequent itemsets too This property is significant different from the property of frequent itemsets. It is a unique property of fault tolerant frequent itemsets Property 3 Satisfied with prerequisite of fault tolerance parameter, subset of fault tolerant frequent itemsets must be fault tolerant frequent itemsets too  Definition 1 For certain frequent itemsets X and Y if there exist X 001 Y  004 and then there exist following eight association rules X 001 Y  X 001  Y  X 001 Y  X 001  Y and Y 001 X  Y 001 X  Y 001 X  Y 001  X  The form X 001 Y is called positive association rule and X 001  Y  X 001 Y  X 001  Y are called negative association rules. A certain negative association rules must meet the following three conditions 1 X 001 Y  004  2 supp  X  003 min_supp and supp  Y  003 min_supp  3 supp  X 001  Y  003 min_supp or supp  X 001 Y  003 min_supp  or supp  X 001  Y  003 min_supp  Top-NFTDS algorithm does generate fault tolerant association rules from fault tolerant frequent patterns which are mined by Top-FTDS algorithm. Simultaneously it does reduce invalid rules by the technology of redundant pattern disambiguation, and Top-NFTDS algorithm need not to input minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold.  Description of calculating support of negative association rules is followed Definition 2 For certain frequent itemsets X and Y if there exist X 001 Y  004 and X  Y 002 I and then there exist following equations 1 supp  X   1 supp  X   2 supp  X 001 Y  supp  X  supp  X 001 Y    3 supp  X 001 Y  supp  Y  supp  X 001 Y    4 supp  X 001 Y   1 supp  X  supp  Y  supp  X 001 Y    Description of calculating confidence of negative association rules is followed  Definition 3 For certain frequent itemsets X and Y if there exist X 001 Y  004 and X  Y 002 I and then there exist following equations 1 conf  X 001  Y  supp  X  supp  X 001 Y  supp  X  1 conf  X 001 Y   2 conf  X 001 Y  supp  Y  supp  X 001 Y 1supp  X  3 conf  X 001  Y 1supp  X  supp  Y  supp  X 001 Y 1supp  X 1 conf  X 001 Y  There have not only one definition of redundant association rules Definition 4 For association rule X 001 Y and A 001 B if support and confidence of rule of A 001 B are higher than support and confidence of rule of X 001 Y one thing can be sure that rule A 001 B is redundant association rule of X 001 Y  Definition 5 Let rule X 001 Y and A 001 B satisfy X 001 Y  A 001 B  I and X 002 A that rule A 001 B can be called redundant association rule of rule X 001 Y   Definition 6 Let rule X 001 Y and A 001 B satisfy X 001 Y  I and  A 001 B  L if there exist L 002 I and X 002 A that rule A 001 B can be called redundant association rule of rule X 001 Y  To illustrate redundant association rules more clearly consider the following exampl  TABLE I  R EDUNDANCY IN R ULE G ENERATION  Rule Support Confidence X 001 YZ  supp\(X 001 Y 001 Z  supp  X 001 Y 001 Z  supp  X   XY 001 Z supp\(X 001 Y 001 Z\pp  X 001 Y 001 Z  supp  X 001 Y   XZ 001 Y supp\(X 001 Y 001 Z\pp  X 001 Y 001 Z  supp  X 001 Z   X 001 Y supp\(X 001 Y\ supp  X 001 Y  supp  X   X 001 Z supp\(X 001 Z\ supp  X 001 Z  supp  X   Consider five different rules generated from frequent itemset X, Y, and Z with given support and confidence threshold as shown in Table 1. If rule X 001 YZ is true at a user specified value of support and confidence, then rules such as XY 001 Z  XZ 001 Y  X 001 Y and X 001 Z are redundant From Table 1, we can see that the support and confidence values of the rule X 001 YZ is less than the support and confidence values of those rules such as XY 001 Z  XZ 001 Y  X 001 Y and X 001 Z  The definition of the correlation is as follows Definition 7  Corr X,Y  supp  X 001 Y  supp  X  supp  Y  There are three possible cases for the values of the correlation Corr X,Y First, if there exist Corr X,Y 1, then the association of X and Y are positive correlated. Second, if there exist Corr X,Y 1, then the association of X and Y is negative correlated. Finally, if there exist Corr X,Y 1, then the association of X and Y is interdependent Technology of top-k has been introduced detailedly in preliminary work, here we will not repeat III  M INING T OP K  F AULT T OLERANT A SSOCIATION R ULES OVER D ATA S TREAMS  A  Calculating Fault-Tolerant Negative Itemsets In this section, we extend the theories of negative itemsets to fault-tolerant space.

value of confidence. Top-NFTDS algorithm is designed for mining top-k fault tolerant rules that the k is not the number of fault-tolerant frequent patterns but the number of fault-tolerant association rules. Top-NFTDS algorithm need not input the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold Property 2 shows that fault-tolerant itemsets are unlike traditional itemsets that is no anti-monotone. Here, we construct a specific example to illustrate that calculation of fault tolerant negative itemsets is different from calculation of traditional negative itemsets  Figure 1  Transactions in sliding windows The transaction data stream TDS consists of two consecutive sliding windows, i.e SW 1 and SW 2 Let window size W is 6 transactions [8  L e t f a u lt t o l e r a n t  factor is 1. For mining k most frequent itemsets, TopNFTDS algorithm need not input the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold. Let all generated positive itemsets and negative itemsets are frequent. In Fig.1, let itemset \(a b, c  X and b  c  d  Y  Table 2 shows the positive support, negative support positive fault tolerant support, negative fault tolerant support, confidence, and fault tolerant confidence of X and Y  TABLE II  R EDUNDANCY IN R ULE G ENERATION  Itemsets Supp Conf FT-Supp FT-Conf X 16.7  83.3  Y 33.3 50  X 83.3 16.7  Y 66.7 50  X 001 Y 0 0 50 60 X 001 Y 16.7 100 0 20 X 001 Y 66.7 80 0 0 By calculating above, we can get more useful information. For negative rule X 001  Y traditional calculation method can draw the conclusions that rule  X 001  Y is true. However, by fault tolerant theory, rule  X 001  Y is false, the same as rule X 001  Y If we extend the theories of negative itemsets to fault-tolerant space then we can get higher value of fault tolerant support and fault tolerant confidence. More useful information can help us to judge the effectiveness of discovered rules. By means of Top-NFTDS algorithm, we may achieve the goal of redundant pattern disambiguation more effectively B  Mining Top-k Fault-Tolerant Association Rules In preliminary work, we has proposed Top-NFTDS algorithm. Using this algorithm, we can acquire k fault tolerant itemsets. Then the following work is to generate fault-tolerant association rules. We propose an efficient algorithm called Top-NFTDS to generate rules using technology of fault tolerant negative itemsets. The algorithm consists of two phases: generating fault tolerant rules phase and redundant pattern disambiguation phase Algorithm 1 is designed for generating fault tolerant rules phase and it is given  Algorithm 1: Generating fault tolera n t rules Input F T I 1  F T I 2  F T I k Output: fault tolerant positive rules and fault tolerant negative rules 1  Get-FTitemsets FTI 1  FTI 2  FTI k  2  Initialize PFTR  NFTR  3  For each fault tolerant itemset FTI i do 4  Calculate_Psupp 5  Calculate_Nsupp 6  For each fault tolerant itemset FTI i 001 FTI k  X do 7  Calculate_Psupp 8  Calculate_Nsupp 9  Calculate_Pconf 10  Calculate_Nconf 11  Sort_Psupp 12  Sort_Nsupp 13  Sort_Pconf 14  Sort_Nconf 15  If X Psupp X K  Psupp then 16  If X Pconf X K  Pconf then 17  Creat _PFTrule PFTR  18  End if 19  End if 20  If X Nsupp X K  Nsupp then 21  If X Nconf X K  Nconf then 22  Creat _NFTrule NFTR  23  End if 24  End if 25  End for 26  End fo r In first phase, Top-NFTDS output both fault tolerant positive rules and fault tolerant negative rules with maximum value of support and confidence. Generally these patterns must be exist invalid patterns or expression repeated patterns. Next step Top-NFTDS will prune the fault tolerant space C  Disambiguating redundant patterns In procedure of redundant pattern disambiguation phase, Top-NFTDS draws the fault tolerant rules finally which express useful information and is easy to understand for users Algorithm 2 is designed for disambiguating redundant patterns phase and it is given Algorithm 2: Disambiguating redundant patterns Input: fault tolerant positive rules and fault tolerant negative rules, and K  Output k fault tolerant rule 1  For each rule X do 2  For k 000  K do 3  Calculate_corr FTR i 001 FTR k  4  If X.corr 1 then 5  Remove_rule X

6  End i f  7  If X.corr 1 then 8  Remove_rule X  9  End if 10   k 0 and k  11  End for 12  End fo r  In algorithm 2, line 3-9 achieve the goal of identifying and removing redundant rules. The final phase of TopNFTDS algorithm is described as follows. First, TopNFTDS calculates the correlation of all fault tolerant rules generated by algorithm 1. Second, according to definition 7, Top-NFTDS removes false fault tolerant rules when the value of correlation less than or equal 1. Finally, TopNFTDS draws K fault tolerant rules with higher value both of fault tolerant support and fault tolerant confidence IV  E XPERIMENTAL A NALYSIS  In this section, we will describe the performance of the proposed algorithms. Same as preliminary experiment of mining top-k fault tolerant frequent itemsets, all the programs are implemented using Microsoft Visual C Version 6.0 and performed on a 3.0 GHz Intel Celeron processor with 512 MB memory in a windows XP system In preliminary work, we used the synthetic data set T7.I4.D1000K, T10.I6.D1000K and T15.I10.D1000K generated by IBM synthetic data generator. T, I and D mean the average transaction length, the average length of the maximal frequent itemset, and the total number of transactions, respectively. In this paper, we still use three transaction sets above We draw the conclusion of relationship between fault tolerant factor and support or confidence when K is a determination value  Figure 2  Relationship between 005 and support  Figure 3  Relationship between 005 and confidence  Fig.2 shows the support change of fault tolerant rules with the change of fault tolerant  factor  005 when K is 3000 First, it may mean that the greater value of allowed mismatches, the higher value of support for fault tolerance rules. Second, it may mean that the longer average length of transaction, the higher value of support for fault tolerance rules. Fig.3 shows the confidence change of fault tolerant rules with the change of fault tolerant  factor On the contrary, with the increasing of value of mismatch the confidence of fault tolerant rules become lower. It is clear that the property of fault-tolerant rule conform to the objective fact in real-world data stream V  C ONCLUSION  In order to solve the problem of mining top-k faulttolerance frequent rules over data streams, this paper has developed a novel algorithm called Top-NFTDS. It is integrated with previous research of mining top-k faulttolerant itemsets into an integrity new method. TopNFTDS can discover the true fault-tolerant rules without minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold specified by user. The Top-NFTDS algorithm discovers generalized fault-tolerant rules to express more abundant information, and then by negative fault-tolerant itemsets to disambiguate redundant patterns, ensure the validity of discovered rules. The experiment shows the algorithm is effective. The theoretical analysis shows our algorithm is nice with high efficiency and scalability. At last, by the verification experiment, we prove that TopFTDS is rational and available R EFERENCES  1  A. K. Poernomo  and V.

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
