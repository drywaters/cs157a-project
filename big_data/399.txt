This paper proposes the concept of wei ghted object relation diagram \(WORD\ by extending th e traditional object relation diagram \(ORD\. When generating the interclass test order based on WORD, minimizing the number of realistic stubs \(not the number of classes to be stubbed\ is regarded as optimization objective Some heuristic rules, such as association intensity cycling weight and direc tion factors of edges, are used as important criteria to cut association edges to break cycles. An improved algorithm AICTO is presented via analyzing some principles of the existing methods and overcoming some of their drawbacks. This algorithm has some merits such as the fewer number of classes to be stubbed, holding the associ ation edges with higher RD and excellent stability.

Introduction Object-oriented systems cont ain four different levels of abstraction. They are the me thod level, class level cluster level, and system level. The cluster level consists of the interactions among cooperating classes which are grouped to accomplish some tasks Cluster level testing, also called inter-class testing carries out testing for the interactive classes that constitute a subsystem. It can be thought of a kind of preliminary integration testing, and it emphasizes on testing the interactions among the classes of cluster One major problem in cluster level testing is to determine the inter-class test order, is important for  test order affects the preparation of test cases. Secondly, the order impacts the use of test stubs 1 and drivers. Thirdly, inter-class test order determines the or der and possibility of interclass faults which are detected. There is a basic principle in the object-o riented software testing: Only after the former of a class is fully tested, the test for  ination of inter-class test order is one of key steps in cluster level testing and has crucial influences on faults detection and the reliability of test results 2. Background Classes of cluster are not separate entities, but interact or cooperate with each other in some ways Generally, the relations between classes include inheritance, aggregation The former two are basic relations in object-oriented programs. The association relation between two classes indicates that one class\220s members can be used in another one. In general, two classes use such ways to form association relation: \(i\class accesses another class\220s attributes or uses some shared data \(e.g ii methods; \(iii parameter of another\220s methods. The Fig.1 demonstrates these three styles of association relations between two classes For describing the relations between classes in an object-oriented program, G. Booch et al. presented the class diagram diagram  ORD for short\was proposed  Moreover, J. L. Chen et al. presented the concept of program structure graph \(PSG The class diagram and ORD are too coarse-grained to  1 Stub is a temporary and partial implementation of a class, and is used to test classes that depend on this class Proceedings of the 2005 The Fifth International Confer ence on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT\22205 0-7695-2432-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


describe the concealed information propagated via these class relations, especially association relation. On the other hand, PSG is too intricate to be automatically constructed In well-designed object-oriented software, and there are only inheritance and aggregation relations between classes, the structure and dependency of them should result in a directed acyclic graph \(DAG\this case the determination of inter-class test order is a basic topological sorting problem. But the occurrence of association relation will lead to form cycles in the graph of inter-class rela tion, therefore, breaking cycles to change it into a DAG must be the first step prior to planning test order. Generally, the inheritance and aggregation relations are st rong relations of classes   so these two kinds of edges have low priority of being cut during breaki ng cycles. A popular accepted solution is to remove some association edges gradually until a DAG is gained Among all existing algorithms of inter-class test order, the two representatives are presented by K. C Tai and L. Traon, respectively. Tai\220s algorithm is a two-stage algorithm Major_level num bers are assigned based on inheritance and aggregation dependencies firstly, then, Mi nor_level is determined by cutting reverse edges between major levels or some association relations in the same major level. Traon\220s algorithm firstly recognizes strongly connected components \(SCCs 2 then removes the cycles in SCCs according to some heuristic rules. This algor ithm has two shortcomings 1\ay lead to the removal of an inheritance or aggregation relation. \(2 gorithm is not fully  2 SCCs is an important concept in Graphic Theory, and all nodes in a SCC are mutually accessible by a path, i.e., the in-degree and outdegree of any node are both 0 deterministic in some sense, because the output depends on a number of arbitrary decisions, it may obtain different results. L. C. Briand improved it to som In order to overcome drawbacks of the mentioned algorithms, we add some information about association edges to extend ORD. Based on our extended graph an improved algorithm for planning inter-class test order is presented 3. Weighted object relation diagram As addressed in Section 2, the existing representations of inter-class relation have their own shortcomings. So we have to construct a new object relation diagram \(called as weighted object relation diagram,WORD\not so sophisticated but can depict the intensity information of association edges 3.1 Definition of WORD There is a hypothesis in all existing algorithms of inter-class test order, that is the intensities of all association relations in ORD are equivalent. But it\220s not true in fact, and the intensity varies with the interaction between two classes. In order to enable the stubs to be constructed more easily, we can remove some weak association edges preferentially Definition 1 For a class cluster C the weighted object relation diagram G WORD  C   V  E  W  1 V represents the set of class nodes 2 E  E I  E Ag  E As  000\216 V 000h V where E I is a set of edges representing class inheritance E Ag is a set of edges representing class aggregation E As is a set of edges representing class association 3 W  CW  DF  RD  association edge. It consists of three factors CW represents cycling weight DF represents direction factor of edge, and RD is association intensity. The former two are heuristic rules which can be detailedly discussed in the following sub-section For the sake of illustration, this paper uses a modified version of the example program addressed in  whose W O RD is constructed as Fig. 2 according to the above definition. How to compute the weight W of each association edge will be discussed in the rest of this section Since the inheritance and aggregation edges will not be deleted during breaking cycl es to plan test order, the weights of them are not considered in above WORD definition. The third factor of W, i.e. RD, represents the association intensity be tween two classes, can be calculated through th e flowing formula  Case \(i\iation relations 1   if b.d 1 b is an object of class C2, d is a data member of b, b has been defined or created outside the scope of class C1   2 gvar gvar is a global variable C1::f1  gvar   C2::f2  if gvar 10   Case \(ii C1::f  203b.g\(\203 b is an object of class C2, and is defined outside the scope of class C1  Case \(iii class C1  203f\(\203C2 b\203 b has been defined outside of the scope of C1 and passed as a parameter to C1     Figure 1 Three forms of association relations between two classes Proceedings of the 2005 The Fifth International Confer ence on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT\22205 0-7695-2432-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

For each P  Q  000\217 E  denote the in-degree of node P as P in and node Q 220s out-degree is Q out Tai and Briand take P in  Q out  P in  Q out as the cycling weight respectively. Obviously the Tai\220s is unreasonable, and it is also inaccurate when use P in  Q out to calculate the association edges in CPs. So we redefine the cycling weight as follows Definition 3 Let P  Q  000\217 E As the cycling weight of this edge defined as CW  P  Q  000 if          otherwise in out As p in r out r r PQ PQ EE CW P Q PN Q N N 000\230\000\217 000\037\000!\000 000\230 In above formula N r represents the number of reverse edges to P  Q in the cycle pair P  Q  E p  most situations N r is equal to 1 3.3 Direction factor of edge \(DF When two or more association edges have the same cycling weight in WORD, the order of cutting edges has an important effect on the result. For instance, the edge <C, E>,<E, C> and <D, E> have the same cycling weight in Figure3\(a\orders of cutting edges result in two different results shown in Figure3\(b c Figure 3 The sample graph for DF There is a heuristic rule in Tai\220s algorithm: The reverse association edges of major levels can easily form cycles. It is not t oo hard to find that, the possibility of cycling is as high as the difference of nodes\220 major levels. Direction factor of edge is treated as another heuristic rule in this paper.

Algorithm of inter-class test order Once removing an association edge, testers have to construct a stub for the target class of that edge However, it is not so easy to construct a stub  Therefore, minimizing the number of stubs to be constructed is a primary goal in cluster level testing which is also one of five properties that is proposed by  B a C E D A B b C E D A B c C E D A 000\013\000\026\000\017\000\026\000\017\000\024\000\f 000\013\000\027\000\017\000\020\000\025\000\017\000\024\000\f C2 000\013\000\024\000\017\000\023\000\017\000\025\000\f 000\013\000\024\000\017\000\023\000\017\000\024\000\f 000\013\000\026\000\017\000\026\000\017\000\024\000\f 000\013\000\024\000\017\000\023\000\017\000\024\000\f 000\013\000\024\000\017\000\024\000\017\000\024\000\f 000\013\000\026\000\017\000\024\000\017\000\024\000\f 000\013\000\031\000\017\000\026\000\017\000\024\000\f 000\013\000\027\000\017\000\020\000\026\000\017\000\025\000\f 000\013\000\026\000\017\000\025\000\017\000\024\000\f C0 C1 Rec S0 S1 S2 S3 C4 C3 Legend class inheritance aggregation association Proceedings of the 2005 The Fifth International Confer ence on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT\22205 0-7695-2432-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


K. C. Tai et al., and accepted by most researchers It should be noted that Tai and Traon both use the number of classes to be stubbed as the optimization objective of breaking cycles. Briand discussed that the optimized objective should be the number of specific stubs  whose viewpoint is reasonable in our opinion For a WORD without cycles, inter-class test order can be recursively defined as follows Definition 5 Let CL  i  i 0, be the set of nodes in the diagram with order \(or level\ber being i where 1 CL 1 P 000\260 P 000\217 V and out-degree of P is 0 2 i 1 CL  i  P 000\217 V  P 220s all outgoing edges to nodes in CL  j   j  i outgoing edge to a node in CL  i 1 From this definition, for the graph without cycles the CL  i   i 0 As shown in the WORD, the paths in cycle pairs are strongly connected paths, as well as the main factors of cycling. A conclusion can be drawn by analyzing the theorem1 and 2: If only one association edge exists in a cycle pair, it should be cut while if a cycle pair holds two association edges, one of them should be cut. So remove the association edges firstly in cycle pairs to break local cycles is an effective approach The weight of association edge is a main guidance of cutting edges. In a WORD, association edges are removed according to the following priority \(rules of cutting edges\At first, compare the value of CW and cut the larger, and then compare the DF and remove the higher if their CWs are equal. Consider the factor of RD lastly, and cut the edges with lower RD firstly If two or more edges with the same value of these three vectors, cut anyone of them Through analyzing the merits and shortcomings of algorithms of Tai and Briand, an A lgorithm of I nterC lass T est O rder \(AICTO WORD.

Case study We have applied our algorithm to the example program of Section 3.1, the result is shown in Fig. 4 Meanwhile, we also calculate other two kinds of test orders of the example by using Tai\220s algorithm and Briand\220s respectively, and the result contrast is shown in Table 1 in detail For the purpose of contrast, we also use our algorithm AICTO to calculate the example in reference  5 Because there is no detailed information about the association edges in that sample, we take the RDs of all association edges as 1, and the Table 2 explains the comparison Figure 4 The result of algorithm AICTO for the sample program Figure 5 The result of the samp using AICTO  removed edge Legend 1,-2,1 C2 1,0,2 1,0,1 2,3,1 1,0,1 1,1,1 3,1,1 6,3,1 1,-3,2 3,2,1 C0 C1 Rec S0 S1 S2 S3 1,3,1 C4 C3 2,1,1 2,0,1 5,1,1 6,-2,1 1,0,1 3,1,1 1,0,1 4,0,1 0,-2,1 4,-1,1 1,0,1 E A C F D B H G Algorithm 1 AICTO\(G WORD  Symbol S cut represents the set of association edges to be cut in G WORD  S in represents the set of nodes whose in-degree is 0 S out represents the set of nodes whose out-degree is 0 E c s which are connected with a node Input G WORD V, E, W\ere E={E I E As E Ag and W=\(CW DF, RD Output i>0 Procedure AICTO\(G WORD  construct G'\(V',E',W'\G WORD 000\036 S cut  000\207  for each CP\(V 1 V 2 E p  G WORD   if E p 000\210 E As 1 E=E \205 \(E p 000\210 E As  S cut S cut 001 E p 000\210 E As  G WORD SCCs\(G WORD  recalculate the factor CW of W for each ass. edge in G WORD  for each CP\(V 1 V 2 E p  G WORD  determine the edge e 001\031 E p to be cut according to rules of cutting edges E=E 205 e S cut S cut 001 e  G WORD SCCs\(G WORD  while G WORD 000\217 000\207  recalculate the vector CW of W for each ass. edge in G WORD  e 001\031 E As to s of cutting edges E=E \205 {e S cut S cut 001 e G WORD SCCs\(G WORD   E'=E' \205 S cut 000\036\000\003 product CL\(i\ applying DFS to graph G output CL\(i  Function SCCs\(G=\(V, E, W calculate S in and S out for G while S in 001 000\207 or S out 001 000\207  for each v in \(S in 001 S out  calculate the E c of node v E=E 000\020 E c 000\036\000\003  V=V \205 \(S in 001 S out  recalculate S in and S out for G  n G   Proceedings of the 2005 The Fifth International Confer ence on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT\22205 0-7695-2432-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

Although though Briand\220s algorithm and AICTO both aim to optimize the number of stubs, the result of AICTO is better. In addition, as for the algorithm AICTO, the recursion times are reduced rapidly, and the classes involved in constructing the stubs are fewer, so it holds the merits of the two existing algorithms Since AICTO adopts rational heuri stic rules, the test order planned by it is fairl y steady. However, the other two existing algorithms will draw out several kinds of results, and Briand\220s algorithm sometimes even works out quite worse results. Furthermore, the two existing algorithms may cut the association edges with high intensity and hold the lower, which will absolutely increase the cost of constructing stubs. For example Tai\220s algorithm cuts out the <C4, C0> and keeps another edge with much lower intensity, <C0, C4 6. Conclusion remarks Determining inter-class test order is one of the most difficult tasks in cluster level testing. This paper extends the traditional ORD to WORD. While planning test order based on WORD, we regard the fewest number of stubs to be constructed as optimization objective, and make every endeavor to create the largest possibility to hold the edges with higher RD and lower CW, which is one of two heuristic rules. We also propose a new concept\205\205cycle pair, and remove the association edges in it firstly to improve the efficiency. Meanwhile, DF is presented as the other important heuristic rule to break cycles The algorithm AICTO is better than other two existing famous algorithms. Compared with Tai\220s algorithm, our algorithm clearly optimizes the number of stubs, and can ensure that aggregation or inheritance dependencies will not be deleted in practice. As compared with L. C. Briand\220s algorithm, AICTO can gain the better result with the lower recursions Furthermore, this algorith m possesses the merit of Tai\220s algorithm, that is, the classes involved to create stubs is fewer, and it can hold the strong association edges to simplify the stubs In addition, this algorithm is implemented in our C/C++ program testing prototype called CppTest and produces favorable effects References  M.

In [7, 6, p.242] it is specified that the residual tree be constructed by first constructing the residual database, and then from the residual database constructing the residual tree. Instead, we will construct the residual tree directly Let T be a FP-tree and b an item appearing in T. The residue Rb\(T header for b and following the horizontal links so as to en  counter all the b-nodes in T. At each b-node, travel upward to find and mark all its ancestors. Sometimes \(for example when the minimum support threshold 0" is 1 tree is isomorphic to the set of marked nodes and the copy  ing process is straightforward. Other times, consolidation of paths occurs, because some items in J &lt;b become not fre  quent. An algorithm to construct the residual tree is pre  sented in [9], and is linear in the number of nodes marked in the parent tree, even when consolidation occurs. This lin  earity may fail to hold in the standard FP-growth algorithm because of sorting of items when constructing the residual tree 4.1 Time complexity of the variant of FP-growth Proposition 8 The time complexity of the variant of FP  growth on a database D equals the sum of the following three quantities  size\(D f the number qf items in all records  the sum of the number of nodes in unconsolidated residual FP-trees  the size of the output, i.e. the sum of the number of items in all frequent sets Proof. From the pseudocode above, it is clear that the computational complexity of the execution time is the sum of the three quantities  time to read data file D and construct the original FP  tree. The time to read D is 8\(size\(D  nal FP-tree can be constructed in the same time bound  time to construct all residual FP-trees. By choosing to construct each residual FP-tree directly from its parent FP-tree, the time to construct it is linear in the number of nodes of the parent tree marked during the process of constructing it. If no consolidation occurs, this num  ber equals the number of nodes in the FP-tree being constructed  time to write frequent sets Each of these three quantities is linear in the correspond  ing quantity in the statement of the proposition.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
