In this context, documents may have  similar  content but different structure and thus in this work we propose an approximate way to query XML data by means of association rules 1 Introduction XML [6] is spreading out as a standard for representing, exchanging, and publishing information [1]. XML is a markup language which is suitable for representing semistructured data, which are often referred to as  selfdescribing  i.e. no pre-imposed schema or type is needed for data interpretation itself. In this context, users are allowed to query a huge amount of XML documents having  similar  content but different structure: this means that the documents contain information related to the same topic but structured in different ways. Thus, a ?exible approach to query this kind of XML documents is needed In this work, we extend and complete the approach, proposed in [5], to deal with content-based querying of XML data, without discarding the \(possibly heterogenous ture, given by the nesting of elements. In particular, we allow the user to specify a list of association rules. The result of a request is a list of XML documents ordered by their satis?ability degree with respect to the request. Note that in our approach we query XML documents and return XML documents, i.e. we do not use surrogate documents and we do not extract subparts of the resulting documents Given a set D of XML documents, the user proposes a query based on either a structural or a content based rule and chooses the evaluation technique to use in order to com?This work has been partially supported by contributions from the Italian Ministry of University and Research \(MIUR  COFINPRIN 2003 Representing and managing spatial and geographical data on the Web   pute the satis?ability degree of the documents with respect to the rule. The system returns an ordered sequence of XML documents satisfying all the rules The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we recall the main approaches in the context of Information Retrieval \(IR notion related to approximate queries on XML documents while in Section 4 we describe the iterative process of XML documents extraction, by using an illustrative example. Finally, in Section 5 we report some conclusions 2 Related Work In the recent years, a large number of query languages for XML documents have been proposed, but none of them allows one to fully address the IR issue related to XML [6 In particular, XQuery [2], the language proposed by W3C is a database-oriented query language and it does not support completely a content-based querying of XML document. XQuery and the other XML query languages allow the user to express a need by means of a SQL-like query considering the requested structure \(path expression the desired values. In particular, there are two main approaches related to the retrieval of structured documents structural approach and content-based approach. The structural approach enriches text search by conditions related to the document structure [14], such as subdivision in chapters, sections, etc., while the content-based approach allows one to retrieve the most relevant parts of a document with respect to a given request. Hearst and Plaunt [10 have investigated the problems related to the absence of explicit structural information; several papers [8, 12, 13 


explicit structural information; several papers [8, 12, 13 deal with the combination of explicit structural information and content-based retrieval. In the approaches used for the retrieval of XML documents both XML documents and queries are represented as trees and thus the retrieval of information becomes a tree matching problem [16]. A rst full-functional proposal of information retrieval on XML documents is [9]. In this work, the authors de?ne XIRQL, an XML query language dealing with imprecision and vagueness both for structural and content-oriented 1 Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications  DEXA  05 1529-4188/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE query conditions. The corresponding uncertainty is handled by using a consistent probabilistic model. XIRQL supports weighting and ranking, relevance oriented-searches data types with vague predicates and semantic relativism The language is powerful but not simple enough for non expert users. In [3] the authors consider imprecision related to query conditions and propose the concept of XML fragments as queries. This proposal is simpler than [9] and allows users to specify term preferences and rejections. Another approach to query XML data in an approximate way is presented in [7]; in these proposals the graphical representations of an XML document were extended to consider all the possible paths between two connected nodes. Recent papers [4, 11, 15] suggest the usage of ef?cient indexes in order to query XML documents by means of path expressions 3 Querying XML documents by using approximate rules In this work we analyze the problem of querying a set of XML documents by means of special kinds of association rules, namely structural and value rules. The evaluation of structural and value rules returns a similarity degree taking into account the structure of the document and its content respectively. Different kinds of evaluation techniques can be adopted to evaluate the proposed rules. The main aim of our work is to obtain an ordered subset, of the initial set of XML documents, satisfying all the rules We choose to represent XML documents as XML graphs whose nodes represent XML elements, and edges represent their containment relationships. In Figure 1 we show an example of XML graph. We consider general XML documents, thus we allow the presence of mixed XML elements For this reason, we have mixed XML graphs composed by two kinds of nodes: simple nodes, and complex nodes. A simple node is a leaf and has a speci?c value \(see for example the node BDate in Figure 1 at least one outgoing edge and may have a speci?c value When a complex node has a value, then it is called mixed mixed complex node are mixed nodes, while the node Person is a complex node Given a set D of XML documents, the process starts with the formulation of a user  s rule q1; the user chooses the evaluation strategy \(see Sections 3.1 and 3.2 evaluate q1 over D and de?nes the threshold value s1 for the rule q1. The evaluation strategy is used to obtain the ordered subset of documents \(D1 ability degree greater than s1. The documents in D1 will be ordered with respect to their satis?ability degrees. The process can be repeated with the formulation of another rule q2 on the set D1. At the end of the process, it is possible to obtain the ordered subset of XML documents, satisfying all Person PhDStudent PhDStudent ResearchGroup PhDInfo PhDStudent ResearchGroup PhDInfo Salary Salary

An example of XML graph the requested rules, with satis?ability degrees greater than the required ones As just mentioned, in our approach it is possible to process rules taking into account the structure \(with respect to the nesting particular, a structural rule allows one to evaluate the similarity of an XML document with respect to the structure proposed in the rule. A value rule allows one to check the similarity of the information contained in an XML document with respect to both the structure and the content required by the rule As we will report in the following, we describe a rule over an XML document by means of the logical notation ElementS ? ElementD, where ElementS is the starting element \(starting node tination element \(destination node ElementS ? ElementD implies that in the considered XML document, the XML tag having name ElementD is nested into the XML tag having name ElementS In this work, we will extend the notion of value rule reported in [5], in order to specify the information contained not only in the destination node but also in the starting node 3.1 Structural rules Structural rules allow one to evaluate the similarity of an XML document with respect to a given structure [5]. For example, with respect to the XML document of Figure 1 a structural rule could be PhDStudent ? Salary. This rule means that a PhD student has to have a salary In [5] we proposed an algorithm for checking the satisfaction of a structural rule over an XML document and different evaluation strategies. The idea is to extract the subgraphs of the XML graph satisfying the structural rule this step is named subgraphs extraction. The extracted subgraphs can satisfy the required structure in a more or less precise way, i.e. the destination node could be directly con2 Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications  DEXA  05 1529-4188/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE nected to the starting node or between them a path composed by more than one edge could occur. A subgraph weight is associated to each extracted subgraph; the weight takes into account the correspondence of the subgraph with the required structure and it can be calculated by using different evaluation strategies. In the case of a structural rule a reasonable evaluation technique can take into account the number of edges needed to reach the destination node from 


number of edges needed to reach the destination node from the starting node. The subgraph weight related to the i-th subgraph is denoted as ssdi. The structural satis?ability degree \(ssd document with respect to the proposed rule and is a value in 0,1]. The ssd assumes value 1 if all the extracted subgraphs respect the required structure; it can be calculated with the formula ssd n i=1 ssdi  1 n where n is the number of the subgraphs extracted The strategies proposed for the evaluation of the ssdi associated to a structural rules are  direct reachability: it allows one to evaluate whether the starting node is directly connected to the destination node. In this case, the ssdi is 1 if in the i-th extracted subgraph the destination node is a child of the starting node and 0 otherwise  undirect reachability: it allows one to evaluate whether the destination node can be reached from the starting node with a path composed by more than one edge. In this case, the ssdi is in inverse proportion to the number of edges composing the path between the starting node and the destination node The proposed evaluation techniques represent an example of possible approaches used to evaluate rules considering the subgraph structure; other suitable techniques could be studied and used Example 1 Evaluating the rule PhDStudent ?

approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint.

This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS.

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
