to induce association rules from transaction data. In the past, we used the fuzzy and GA concepts to discover both useful fuzzy association rules and suitable membership functions from quantitative va lues. The evaluation for fitness values was, however, quite time-consuming. In this paper, we thus propose a parallel genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm based on the master-slave architecture to extract both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions. The master processor uses a single population as a simple genetic algorithm does, and distributes the tasks of fitness evaluation to slave processors. The evolutionary processes, such as crossover mutation and production are performed by the master 
processor. Both the theoretic analysis and the experimental results show that the speed-up of the proposed parallel algorithm can increase nearly linear along with the number of individuals to be evaluated Keywords data mining, fuzzy set, genetic algorithm parallel processing, association rule 1  Introduction  Recently, the fuzzy set theory a s been u s ed  more and more frequently in intelligent systems because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning [19   Several fuzzy mining algorithms for managing quantitative data have also been proposed [8, 15, 20 h ere t h e  
membership functions were assumed to be known in advance. The given membership functions may, however have a critical influence on the final mining results. Genetic algorithms \(GAs h a v e als o recen tl y been u s ed in the field of data mining since they are powerful search techniques in solving difficult problems and can provide feasible solutions in a limited amount of time. Hong et al thus proposed a GA-based fuzzy data-mining meth  for extracting both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions. In that method, the fitness evaluation is based on the suitability of derived 
membership functions and the number of large itemsets The evaluation for fitness values is, however, quite timeconsuming  Due to dramatic increases in available computing power and concomitant decreases in computing costs over the last decade, learning or mining by applying parallel processing techniques has become a feasible way of overcoming the problem of slow learning. Several parallel approaches to speed up the process of data-mining were proposed [5, 18, 23 n ad d itio n  so m e p a rallel  architectures for genetic algorithms were also suggested 1  T h ey h a v e b een a p p lied to so lv in g ti m e tab l e scheduling and discovering classification rules 
 Among the parallel architectures, the master-slave architecture is particularly easy to implement. It also usually promises substantial gains in performance [9 h e master processor allocates the tasks to the slave processors and collects the results from them. It can also do its own work if necessary. As mentioned before, the fitness evaluation in genetic-fuzzy data mining is usually very time-consuming. In this paper, we thus extend our previous work [17 b y u s i n g  th e m a ster s la v e p a rallel arc h itect u r e to  dynamically adapt membership functions and to use them to deal with quantitative transactions in fuzzy data mining 
It is very natural and efficient to design a parallel GA-fuzzy mining algorithm based on the master-slave architecture The master processor uses a single population as a simple genetic algorithm does, and distributes the tasks of fitness evaluation for suitability of membership functions and large itemsets to slave processors. The evolutionary processes, such as crossover, mutation and production are performed by the master processor. We expect that by appropriately allocating the tasks among the different types of processors, the efficiency of the proposed genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm can greatly be raised  2 
 Review of related works  Some related works about data mining and genetic algorithms are first reviewed below 2.1  Data Mining  The goal of data mining is to discover important associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of some other items. To achieve this purpose, Agrawal and his coworkers proposed several mining algorithms based on the concept of large itemsets to find association rules in transaction data [2, 3, 4, 6 Srik an t an d  Ag ra w a l t h e n  


proposed a mining method [22 to h a n d le q u an tita tiv e  transactions by partitioning the possible values of each attribute. Hong et al. proposed a fuzzy mining algorithm to mine fuzzy rules from quantitative data [15   T h e y  transformed each quantitative item into a fuzzy set and used fuzzy operations to find fuzzy rules. Cai et al proposed weighted mining to reflect different importance to different items ite m  w a s a ttach ed a num erical  weight given by users. Weighted supports and weighted confidences were then defined to determine interesting association rules. Kaya et al. [20 p r op os ed a GA b as ed clustering method to derive a predefined number of membership functions for getting a maximum profit within an interval of user specified minimum support values 2.2  Genetic algorithm  Genetic algorithms \(GAs\ [11 1 2  ha ve b e c o m e  increasingly important for researchers in solving difficult problems since they could provide feasible solutions in a limited amount of time T h ey  w e re f i rs t propos ed by  Holland in d h a v e been s u cce s s fu l l y appl i e d t o  many fields. On applying genetic algorithms to solving a problem, the first step is to define a representation that describes the problem states. The most common way used is the bit string representation. An initial population of individuals, called chromosomes, is then defined and the three genetic operations \(crossover, mutation, and selection\ are performed to generate the next generation Each chromosome in the population is evaluated by a fitness function to determine its goodness. This procedure is repeated until a user-specified termination criterion is satisfied. As to parallel GA, three types were proposed as single-population master-slave Gas, single-population finegrained Gas and Multiple-population coarse-grained GAs  m ong t h e abov e t h ree t y pe s  t h e t y pe of  m a s t er-s l a v e  parallel GAs consists of a simple structure and uses less parameter to control the process of evolution. This type of parallel GAs has been successfully applied for solving timetable scheduling and discovering classification rules 1  th is p a p e r w e  w ill u s e th i s p a rallel arch itect u r e to  fuzzy data mining due to its suitability   3  A parallel genetic-fuzzy mining framework  In w e  u s ed th e fu zz y an d GA con cepts to discover both useful association rules and suitable membership functions from quantitative values. The proposed approach in that paper is shown in Figure 1 where a genetic algorithm was proposed for searching membership functions suitable for mining problems and then the final best set of membership functions was used to mine association rules Chromosome 1  MF Acquisition process linguistic terms Membership Genetic Fuzzy Fuzzy Mining for Large 1-itemsets Final  Membership Function Set Minimum support Minimum confidence  Function Set 1 Membership Function Set 2 Membership Membership Function Set q Function Set 3 Chromosome 2 Chromosome 3 Chromosome q  Transaction Database Population Fuzzy Mining Fuzzy Association Rules  Mining Membership Functions Mining Fuzzy Association Rules Chromosome 1  MF Acquisition process linguistic terms Membership Genetic Fuzzy Fuzzy Mining for Large 1-itemsets Final  Membership Function Set Minimum support Minimum confidence  Function Set 1 Membership Function Set 2 Membership Membership Function Set q Function Set 3 Chromosome 2 Chromosome 3 Chromosome q  Transaction Database Population Fuzzy Mining Fuzzy Association Rules Fuzzy Association Rules  Mining Membership Functions Mining Fuzzy Association Rules  Figure 1: A GA-based approach for fuzzy data mining  In this section, a parallel genetic-fuzzy framework based on the master-slave architecture is thus proposed to speed up the mining process. The proposed framework is shown in Figure 2  Figure 2: The proposed parallel genetic-fuzzy mining framework  In Figure 2, there are p 1 processors composed of one master and p slaves. Each processor has an identical transaction database for mining. Since the fitness evaluation process is the most time-consuming part in the entire genetic-fuzzy mining process, it is thus processed in parallel by the slave processors. The other part is processed by the master processor. The parallel genetic-fuzzy data mining framework includes two phases, mining membership function and mining fuzzy association rules In the first phase, the master and the slaves cooperate to gradually discover a set of adaptive membership functions The master processor maintains a population of sets of membership functions and performs the genetic operators to select, mate and evolve chromosomes. The master processor distributes the tasks of fitness evaluation for suitability of membership functions and large itemsets to slave processors. Each slave processor with an identical transaction database then calculates the fitness value of a chromosome that is assigned by the master. The evaluation results from the slaves are then sent back to the master. The master processor then performs the evolutionary processes    p  Slaves  Master  TDB TDB TDB TDB TDB  TDB  TDB TDB TDB  TDB  


such as crossover, mutation and production according to the evaluation results collected. After undergoing recursive evolutions, a good set of membership functions can be obtained. The good set of membership functions is then used in the second phase by the master processor to mine fuzzy association rules. The second phase is not necessary to be processed in parallel since the most time-critical part is phase 1. The time complexity analyzed later will show this   4  Chromosome representation and fitness evaluation  It is important to encode membership functions as string representation for GAs to be applied. Several possible encoding approaches have been described in [10 21, 24, 25 t h i s paper eac h s e t of  m e m b ers h i p f u n c t i o n s  is encoded as a chromosome and handled as an individual with real-number schema  In order to effectively encode the associated membership functions, we use two parameters to represent each membership function, as Parodi and Bonelli [21 d i d   Membership functions applied to a fuzzy rule set are then assumed to be isosceles-triangle functions Note that other types of membership functions \(e.g. non-isosceles trapezes\ also be adopted in our method. For coding non-isosceles triangles and trapezes, three and four points are needed instead of two for isosceles triangles  In order to develop a good set of membership functions from an initial population, the genetic algorithm selects parent membership function sets with high fitness values for mating. Note that the selection of membership function sets is performed by the master processor, and the evaluation of each membership function set is processed by the slave processors. An evaluation function is defined to qualify the derived membership function sets. The evaluation results are then sent back to the master processor to control how the solution space is searched to promote the quality of the membership functions. The fitness value of a chromosome C q is defined as follows         1 q q C y suitabilit L C f   where suitability C q e suitability of the membership functions in a chromosome C q  and L 1  is the number of large 1-itemsets obtained by using the set of membership functions. The suitability is defined according to the two factors  overlap ratio and coverage ratio. The overlap ratio of two membership functions is defined as the overlap length divided by half the minimum span of the two functions. The coverage ratio of a set of membership functions for an item is defined as the coverage range of the functions divided by the maximum quantity of that item in the transactions. The suitability factor used in the fitness function can reduce the occurrence of the two bad kinds of membership functions shown in Figure 3, where the first one is too redundant, and the second one is too separate Details can be referred to in [17   589 Low Middle High Quantity 0 a 589 Low Middle High Quantity 0 a 52025 Low Middle High Quantity 0 b 52025 Low Middle High Quantity 0 b  Figure 3: Two bad membership functions  Besides, using the number of large 1-itemsets can achieve a trade-off between execution time and rule interestingness. Usually, a larger number of 1-itemsets will result in a larger number of all itemsets with a higher probability, which will thus usually imply more interesting association rules. The evaluation by 1-itemsets is, however faster than that by all itemsets or interesting association rules. It can be further speeded up by the parallel processing approach proposed in this paper  Two genetic operators, the max-min-arithmetical MMA\rossover proposed in d t h e one-point  mutation are used in the genetic fuzzy mining framework Note that the genetic operations are performed by the master processor 5  The proposed parallel genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm  According to the above description, the proposed parallel algorithm for mining both fuzzy association rules and membership functions is described below The proposed parallel genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm INPUT: One master processor p slave processors p is the maximum number of individuals to be evaluated in each generation\, a body of n quantitative transaction data stored in each processor, a set of m items, a support threshold   and a confidence threshold   OUTPUT: A set of fuzzy association rules with its associated set of membership functions STEP 1  Randomly generate a population of individuals by the master processor; each individual is a set of membership functions for all the m items STEP 2  Encode each set of membership functions into a string representation by the master processor STEP 3  Distribute the individuals from the master processor to the slave processors 


STEP 4  Calculate the fitness value of each chromosome by each corresponding slave processor by the following substeps STEP 4.1  For each transaction datum D i  i 1 to n and for each item I j  j 1 to m transfer the quantitative value v j i into a fuzzy set f j i  represented as     jl i jl j i j j i j R f R f R f   2   2 1   1   using the corresponding membership functions represented by the chromosome where R jk is the k th fuzzy region \(term\ of item I j  f jl i  is v j i s fuzzy membership value in region R jk and l  I j is the number of linguistic terms for I j  STEP 4.2  For each item region R jk calculate its scalar cardinality count jk on the transactions as follows   n i i jk jk f count 1    STEP 4.3  For each R jk 1   j   m and 1   k   I j check whether its count jk  is larger than or equal to the minimum support threshold  If R jk  satisfies the above condition, put it in the set of large 1-itemsets L 1 hat is L 1  R jk  count jk     1  j  m and 1  k   I j   STEP 4.4  Set the fitness value of the chromosome as the number of large itemsets in L 1 divided by s uitability  C q hat is       1 q q C y suitabilit L C f   STEP 5  Send the fitness value f  C q chromosome C q from each slave processor to the master processor STEP 6  Execute the crossover operations on the population by the master processor STEP 7  Execute the mutation operations on the population by the master processor STEP 8  Distribute the individuals to be evaluated from the master processor to the slave processors STEP 9  Calculate the fitness value of each chromosome by each corresponding slave processor as in STEP 4 STEP 10  Send the fitness value f  C q chromosome C q from each slave processor to the master processor STEP 11  Use the defined selection criteria to choose suitable individuals for the next generation by the master slave STEP 12  If the termination criterion is not satisfied, go to Step 6; otherwise, do the next step STEP 13  Use the set of membership functions with the highest fitness value for finding all fuzzy large itemsets by the master processor STEP 14  Find the fuzzy association rules from the fuzzy large itemsets by the master processor  In Steps 13 and 14, our fuzzy mining algorithm proposed in be u s ed t o f i n d t h e resu l t s   6  Time complexity analysis  The time complexities of both the sequential and the parallel genetic-fuzzy mining algorithms are first analyzed The speed-up of the parallel mining algorithm is then derived. Some notation is first defined as follows p  the number of slave processors \(the maximum number of individuals to be evaluated n  the number of generations f: the average execution time of calculating the fitness value of an individual in each generation g the average execution time of processing all genetic operations during a generation c the average communication time between a master processor and a slave processor during a generation s the average execution time of mining the association rules in the second phase s ave T the average execution time of the sequential GAfuzzy mining algorithm p ave T the average execution time of the parallel GA-fuzzy mining algorithm ave S the average speed-up calculated by s ave T over p ave T    The average time complexity of the sequential mining algorithm is s g f p n T s ave          The paralllel mining algorithm can distribute the fitness-evaluation tasks to the slave processors. Therefore the execution time for the fitness evaluaion in each generation needs only f The parallel algorithm, however needs additional computation time c between a master 


processor and slave processors. The average time complexity of the paralled mining algorithm is thus s c g f n T p ave          The average speed-up is thus  s c g f n s g f p n T T S p ave s ave ave               In this paper, the fitness evaluation is based on the suitability of derived membership functions and the number of large 1-itemsets. The entire database must be scanned to find the large 1-itemsets. The average evaluation time f is thus much larger than the average execution time for genetic operations g especially when the processed dataset is large. In addition, since the master only distributes the code of a chromosome to a slave and receives a number the evaluation value\rom the slave, the communication time is thus very little. Therefore, the speed-up can be further simplified as the following s f n s f p n s c g f n s g f p n S ave                    The average evaluation time f includes the time of finding large 1-itemsets. The average execution time s of mining association rules in the second phase includes finding all large itemsets and deriving rules from them s is thus larger than f However, because the number of items in the longest large itemsets is usually small, some pruning techniques may be used to reduce the mining time s and the number of generations is usually set at more than one hundred s may thus be much smaller than n*f especially when n is large. In this case, the above speed-up can be further simplified as        p f n f p n s f n s f p n S ave        Thus, when the number of generations is large, the speed-up is nearly linear 7  Experimental results  In this section, the experiments made to show the performance of the proposed approach are described. They were simulated in Java on a personal computer with Intel Pentium IV 3.2GHz and 512MB RAM. 64 items and 10000 transactions were used in the experiments. In each data set the numbers of purchased items in transactions were first randomly generated. The purchased items and their quantities in each transaction were then generated. An item could not be generated twice in a transaction. The crossover rate p c is set at 0.8, and the mutation rate p m is set at 0.01. The minimum support   is set at 400. Experiments with different population sizes from 10 to 50 were made to show the speed-up trend of the proposed algorithm. The communication time was not considered. Note that by the genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm proposed in h e  maximum number p of individuals to be evaluated in each generation was 2.6 r where r is the number of individuals in a population. The experimental results are shown in Figure 4        Figure 4: The experimental results for speed-up with transaction I/O time  It can be easily observed from the above figure that the speed-up increases nearly linearly along with the number of slave processors. The speed-up is also close to the number of slave processors. It is quite consistent with our analysis in Section 6 8  Conclusions  In this paper, we have proposed a parallel geneticfuzzy mining algorithm based on the master-slave architecture to extract both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions. The master and the slaves first cooperate to discover a set of suitable membership functions. The set of membership functions found is then used by the master processor to mine fuzzy association rules. The second phase is not necessary to be processed in parallel since the most timecritical part lies in phase 1. The time complexities for both sequential and parallel genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm have been analyzed, with results showing the good effect of the proposed approach. When the number of generations is large, the speed-up can be nearly linear. The experimental results have also shown this point. Applying the masterslave parallel architecture to speed up the genetic-fuzzy data mining algorithm is thus a feasible way to overcome the low-speed fitness evaluation problem of the original algorithm Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank Mr. Chun-Hao Chen for his help in making the experiments This research was supported by the National Science Council of the Republic of China under contract NSC93-2213E -390-001

The accumulative weighted count threshold from partition P1 to partition P2 is 0.804 + 0.804 = 1.608. We ?nd that 5 new 2-itemsets, AB, AF , BE, BF , and EF in P2 have weighted counts greater than m2, so they are added to C2. Furthermore, the old itemsets AD, AE, DE, and DF have their accumulative weighted counts greater than 1.608. Therefore, they are retained in C2.

The itemsets generated in P1 all have accumulative weighted counts greater than 2.25 and the itemsets generated in P2, except BE, have accumulative weighted counts greater than 1.45, so they are retained in C2 and BE is deleted from C2. The resulting candidate 2-itemsets after processing P3 are shown in the right part of Table 3 Therefore, we have C2 = {AB,AD,AE,AF,BF,DE,DF,EF C3 = {ABF,ADE,ADF,AEF,DEF C4 = {ADEF Ck = ?, k ? 5 By scanning D once, we have the sets of frequent kitemsets, Lk, k ? 2, of D along with their counts to be L2 = {\(AD, 3.61 AE, 3.21 AF, 3.61 BF, 3.21 DE, 2.54 DF, 3.61 EF, 2.54 L3 = {\(ADE, 2.54 ADF, 2.94 AEF, 2.54 Lk = ?, k ? 4 and L = L2?L3.

Experimental Results In this section, experimental results obtained with a PC with AMD Athlon XP CPU and 1.0G memory are presented 4.1. Experiment 1 In this experiment, we compare our fuzzy calendar algebra with the calendar algebra proposed in [16]. The Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  TIME  04 1530-1311/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE Figure 4. Performance comparison between the calendar algebra and our fuzzy calendar algebra with a simple calendar calendar algebra de?nes operators such as dicing, slicing, and ?atten to construct complex calendars. The time intervals are obtained from a speci?ed calendar and the calendric association rules are discovered in these time intervals. For a complex calendar, the calendar algebra decomposes the calendar into basic ones 


endar algebra decomposes the calendar into basic ones and then the time intervals of each basic calendar are separately searched. This approach is not e?cient since one time interval may be searched with several di?erent basic calendars. On the contrary, our fuzzy calendar algebra checks each time interval only once and can easily ?nd out all the time intervals in a given calendar. Repetitive and unnecessary searches in a time interval can be avoided, and the performance is improved We use 1825 time intervals collected in 5 years, with each time interval representing one day in a year. The execution time for ?nding out the desired time intervals by the calendar algebra and the fuzzy calendar algebra, respectively, is shown in Figure 4. The calendar algebra searches each time interval twice while the fuzzy calendar algebra searches each time interval only once, and thus we can clearly see that our method is more e?cient in interpreting calendars. For more complicated calendars, i.e., containing more basic calendars, our fuzzy calendar algebra performs even better as shown in Figure 5 4.2. Experiment 2 In this experiment, we  d like to show the e?ectiveness of our strategy for mining fuzzy temporal patterns. The number of candidates and frequent itemsets discovered are reported. The execution time for discovering the itemsets is also presented. The dataset Figure 5.

The dataset is partitioned into 200 partitions and there are 500 transactions in each partition. To infer from these partitions with our fuzzy calendar algebra, we assume the ?rst partition being the time interval of 2003/01/01, the second partition being of 2003/01/02, . . . , and so on.

Execution time with di?erent support thresholds are natural and easy for use in the sense that they capture the way in which human beings reason with time requirements. To accommodate temporal expressions with multiple time granularities, ?ve operations, and 


with multiple time granularities, ?ve operations, and or, not, xor, and sub, are introduced We have shown the usefulness of the fuzzy calendar algebra by incorporating it with PWM to mine fuzzy temporal association rules from temporal databases Firstly, the transactions of the database are divided into a sequence of partitions. Then the weight of each partition is inferred, denoting the matching degree of the corresponding time period to the fuzzy calendar speci?ed in the user  s queries. Temporal patterns in the divided time periods of di?erent matching degrees are then e?ciently produced, and the number of database scans can be e?ectively reduced.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
