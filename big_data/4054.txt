Rehabilitation Database Based on Haptic Signal Processing  Toshiaki Tsuji, Naoyuki Kurita, Mitsuyuki Yamada, Sho Sakaino, and Yasuyoshi Kaneko Graduate School of Science and Engineering Saitama University Saitama, Japan  Abstract The growth of the internet brings up new keywords for the information technology, such as cloud computing and big data. The increasing data in the information society has a potential to offer new insight into the real world. On the other hand, the increasing demand for rehabilitation of aged people has resulted in increased demand for physical therapy robots. Therefore, this paper proposes the construction of rehabilitation database extending the concept of medical cloud technologies. We discuss the possibility of establishing a new validation methodology by generating database created using the data collected with rehabilitation equipment. Statistical processing was applied to the data collected using the rehabilitation equipment, for investigating an example of a validation method  The results show that a new knowledge for physical therapy can be extracted through a statistical evaluation with database compiled from quantitative sensor information  Keywords physical therapy robot, movement therapy, haptics biarticular muscle, pneumatic artificial muscle  I  I NTRODUCTION  Owing to an increase in the disabled population, there has been increased demand for rehabilitating aged people, with provision for movement therapy to prevent muscle contracture While movement therapies are generally guided by physical therapists \(PTs\ace-to-face sessions may not always be possible owing to time constraints. Therefore, physical therapy robots have been developed by various research groups for reducing the workload of a PT [1    Kahn et al have shown that the use of rehabilitation apparatus for upper limbs is effective in mitigating spasms[4   Krebs et al have reported outstanding results for training with an upper limb rehabilitation device using a two-dimensional force display system Pn eum a tic arti f i cial m u s c le s are attractive for rehabilitation robots since they are light weight and compliant m pedance con t rol s t rate g i es are al s o  common for generating a compliant motion by a lowbackdrivability rehabilitation robots   Although the feasibility of using medical equipment for aiding movement therapy has been studied, the problem related to sharing information between PTs has not been addressed. Since a PT can gather only limited information from patients, the physical therapy education is time-intensive Hence, medical robots have been proposed for assisting medical students in training trodu ction of th e m e dical cloud concept may enable efficient information sharing and the development of new next-generation physical therapy techniques The information used by a PT is based on force. Therefore specific equipment is necessary for recording and saving the required information. Physical therapy robots, which can be classified as rehabilitation equipment, have the ability to record and save information because most of them are digital equipment. Focusing on this characteristic, this study attempts to generate rehabilitation database using physical therapy robots. Some previous studies have succeeded in recording and compressing kinematic information of human motion in motion database [9 e r e h a b ilit ati o n d a ta b a s e  n e ed s  t o  record not only kinematic information but also force information. Shimono et al have proposed a method to store a bilateral force information to a force sensation recorder [10  In  view of safety in force sensation recording, the authors have developed an accurate force control system using pneumatic actuators  Si gna l  p r o c e s si ng t e c hno l o gi e s i n hap t i c s ar e necessary for solving the issues of rehabilitation database Command recognition [12  an d p e rs on al i d en t i f i ca ti on   1 3   based on haptic information can be extended for classification of rehabilitation data. A method for extraction of the range of motion using a rehabilitation robot has also been proposed [1  Due to the recent growth of the internet, a great deal of rehabilitation data can be gathered if the physical therapy robots are connected via the internet. One of the largest advantages of using robots for movement therapy is that the quantitative assessment of the therapy is available Furthermore, statistic analysis of movement therapy will be available by adding the advantage of data gathering through the internet. Note that it is quite difficult for therapists to gather data of large number of patients in different medical organizations. In sum, development of rehabilitation database may enhance researches in the area of movement therapy by realizing quantitative and statistic analysis of movement therapy. Therefore, this paper extends the abovementioned studies to rehabilitation database and show the validity through some examples of database utilization  II  E XPERIMENTAL S ETUP  A  Mechanics of the Experimental Device  The rehabilitation robot used in this study is designed to execute a training of the upper limb.

Table 1 shows the details of the devices used in the experiment. The robotic arm is driven by three pairs of antagonistic pneumatic muscles in order to simulate the muscle arrangement of a human arm Fig. 1 B  Simulation of Human Muscle Arrangement This section shows the model of the muscle arrangement in the upper limb of a human and discusses how to simulate it in the robot arm. Muscles that affect the limb movement are called functional effective muscles [15 T h is p a p e r in tro d u ces a model of functional effective muscles into the robot arm. Fig 3 shows three pairs of antagonistic muscles 1 e and 1 f  2 e and 2 f  3 e and 3 f which are functional effective muscles Mono-articular muscles span one joint, and hence exert force only on a single joint. Since these muscles supply force only in the contraction direction, they are usually arranged antagonistically for supplying positive and negative torque at the joint. Therefore, these muscles are called antagonistic muscles. Variables 1 e and 1 f denote antagonistic monoarticular shoulder muscles, whereas variables  2 e and 2 f  denote antagonistic monoarticular elbow muscles Bi-articular muscles span two joints in series, thus exerting force on both joints 3 e and 3 f represent antagonistic biarticular muscles Stiffness ellipses show the distribution of stiffness in the two-dimensional surface at the tip position. Stiffness ellipses for a human at the tip are different from those for common robots driven by motors placed in each joint. In the case of robotic arms driven by rotary motors placed in each joint, the shape of the stiffness ellipses changes with posture variation caused by external forces. However, in the case of robotic arms that simulate the muscle arrangement in the upper limbs of a human and have three pairs of antagonistic muscles, the direction of force does not change because of the variation in the stiffness ellipse. This has been shown theoretically and confirmed experimentally using robots 17  Th is characteristic is quite important in view of safety since the robot may generate force in undesired direction without the characteristic C  Control Method Fig. 2 shows the control system used in this study.

As mentioned in the first section, most rehabilitation equipment can record and save movement therapy data. Hence, database for a number of patients can be generated by integrating the rehabilitation equipment with a rehabilitation server via a network. Here, a rehabilitation server saves and maintains database of movement therapy data. It also extracts knowledge by statistical processing of the database Although this study uses a physical therapy robot with pneumatic muscles, rehabilitation equipment with electric motors are also applicable as long as the robot satisfy the required accuracy of data recording Fig. 4 shows the framework of rehabilitation database. The rehabilitation equipment, which is composed of a robot and its control processor, sends the sensor output in time series to the server, and database is generated. Simultaneously, some other intrinsic data produced by certain signal processing methods are added for effective data mining. For example, the efficiency of safety evaluation and investigation will be enhanced by introducing the contraction force data pertaining to each muscle in the database\(Fig. 4\(a\\ by introducing an estimation method for muscular force distribution[18  F i g   4\(b\ shows a photo of displaying muscle contraction force of each muscle on the human arm. More effective training is expected by visualizing qualitative data. Further, the database is used for generating new sets of data through knowledge extraction by statistical processing. For example, a new type of classification based on the quantified maximum contraction force of each muscle may be proposed for patients. This study shows one of the simplest examples of this framework in the following sections IEEE R10-HTC2013 Sendai, Japan, August 26-29, 2013 15 


  Fig. 5 Image of whole-body force sensing   Fig. 6 Experimental image  B  Force Sensing Mechanism of Rehabilitation Robot The rehabilitation robot has to acquire force information for evaluation of exercises. A 6-axis force sensor is fixed on the arm tip for sensing. External force observe on e of th e candidate without a force sensor. This study does not use the method because the external force observer needs more motors and optical encoders for 6-axis force sensing. In general, the force sensor canít be used for safety assurance because it only detects the force on the end-effector. However it is also possible to detect force at any point on the robot arm by making the end-effector to a cover sh F i g  5 s h ow s the image  C  Construction of Database of Exercise Therapy Fig. 5 shows the experimental image. The experiment was conducted with ten healthy right-handed male adults in the age group 21ñ24 years as the subjects. Although the purpose of this study was the construction of a database for patients, we first examined healthy subjects due to safety issues. The subjects were seated on a chair and their wrists were fixed on the robotic arm using the force sensor. The arms of the subjects were suspended to eliminate the effect of gravity In the first 5 s of the experiment, each pneumatic artificial muscle was slowly filled with air with the pressure calculated at the stiffness control component. Then, the robotic arm moved to the base posture 1  0.067 [ra d 2  1.308  T h e f o rce com m a n d  w a s  F cmd   d V max  0.12 m/s h e f o rce con t rol co m p o n ent A  m o n itor placed in front of the robot showed the target and the tip position. The subjects moved their arm to follow the target after the robotic arm started position and force control. The tip position was measured by angular encoders, and the force at the tip position was measured by a force sensor The movement patterns of the target were a longitudinal straight line \(x-axis\ise and counterclockwise rotation The initial postural tip position 1 0.067 [rad  2 1.308 rad  w a s set as th e cen ter o f all o f th ese m o v e m e n t p a ttern s   The period was 10.0 s or 5.0 s and the amplitude was 0.08 m These six movements were performed once a day for 10 days D  Results and Examples of Statistical Analysis  The following paragraphs show the advantage of the rehabilitation database by statistical evaluation of some simple database compiled on the basis of the results of the experiment described above. Since the first part of the experiment does not provide any information relevant to the evaluation, the results after 10 s were evaluated. Fig. 6 shows the image of the experiment. Fig. 7 shows the root-mean-square position errors in target tracking. The plots denote the average of the position errors in the case of the ten subjects and the bars denote the variability of the ten subjects by standard deviation. Fig. 8 shows the average arm tip force in a similar manner to the case of Fig. 7. The position tracking errors gradually reduced from the first day to the tenth day in all experiments because the subjects became familiar with the experimental procedure by the tenth day. On the other hand, the average force value did not vary much in the experiments. Although large force was observed in several instances during the first 3 days, the number of samples was small. When the period was 10.0 s, the average force values was smaller than 2.5 N because the force controller based on input shaping worked when the external force was greater than 2.5 N. On the other hand, when the period was 5.0 s, the average force values were greater than 2.5 N because the velocities were greater than V max 0.12 m/s at the force control component Fig. 9 shows the average of velocity spectrum during the 5.0 s period motion. It shows that the velocity spectrum which strongly depends on the control architecture and the control gains, did not have a noticeable change. It infers that the control architecture and its feedback gain of the human arm did not change a lot The simple database based on the experiments performed for 10 days indicates that the tracking efficiency improves gradually because subjects become familiar with the robot and its operation mode by the tenth day. On the other hand, the improvement in maneuverability is much lesser Another interesting result discovered from the database is the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise rotation. Counterclockwise rotatio n resulted in larger force with smaller tracking error. For further investigation, the tracking error was verified in each direction of the movement in Fig. 11. The distance from the center denotes the average error on the direction. The result indicates that the error is larger when subjects are executing pulling in motion IEEE R10-HTC2013 Sendai, Japan, August 26-29, 2013 16

However, stronger proof based on statistical evaluation can be obtained only when using rehabilitation database that gathers a greater number of results through a network.

features are added Such updates are computationally intensive and affect performance adversely as data size increases Our geohash-based approach allows us to calculate a key for each piece of data independently Under this method inserting and deleting an entry uses the regular methods for adding and removing data from Accumulo so we incur no additional overhead The distribution of data is built into the index schema by varying the number of bins and the coarsest spatiotemporal resolution As expected of the temporal queries the largest window  a month  takes the longest to complete Of greater interest is the fact that there is relatively little separation in the querytimes for the day and week periods This is in part attributable to the indexing scheme Each row is identiìed by the event year and month units of time smaller than the month are not encoded until the column qualiìer This means that rowranges are likely to use the time down to the month but not necessarily much ner-grained than that That there is so little difference in the response-times between the day-long intervals and the week-long intervals suggests that either 1 both intervals used the same query plan meaning that they shared the same candidate set and the time required to lter this candidate set is more signiìcant than the time to return query hits or 2 the intervals used different query plans but those plans implicated the same data blocks in which case there was only an insigniìcant difference in the work to be done From our testing we observed that query predicates did result in queries which returned faster since fewer results were returned These additional lters created additional work for the back-end reducing throughput and Accumulo could leverage the distributed disk and processing to realize a substantial speed-up in the rate of return We observed that temporal ltering is less demanding than attribute-ìltering This is because the temporal information is incorporated in the index rows while the attribute information is stored within the encoded Feature as the value of the data rows Tuning the number of bins and the resolution levels has an impact on the performance of the spatio-temporal index The number of bins should roughly correspond to the number of tablet servers so as to ensure parallelized query result computations However the expected growth of the table should be taken into account when deìning the number of bins Since a crucial advantage of distributed data stores over traditional RDBMs is horizontal scalability the store can grow into the number of bins by adding tablet servers at runtime Furthermore if the geospatial domain of data is a subset of the whole world then the coarsest spatial resolution should be tuned accordingly The same applies to the temporal dimension if data falls across decades then year and possibly month should go into the row key while if data falls within a year then the addition of day in the row key will improve performance of typical queries A Future Work In this paper we have performed a basic benchmark of our spatio-temporal software based on Accumulo We have not had a chance to experiment as fully as we would have liked with Accumulo and we would like to outline our future directions First we would like to observe that while tuning traditional RDBMSs is well understood a body of standard advice for tuning Accumulo has not been created and commonly accepted In terms of scalability we currently have a small cloud shared for development We would like to experiment on a larger cloud to show how our software scales In terms of our design there are a number of parameters which we plan to explore in the future First given results from the team Oracle with quadtrees we belie v e that query performance may vary when the geohash resolution of decomposed query polygons and the geohash resolution used to store data are different So far we have had acceptable results storing our data with at the 35-bit resolution but we have not directly studied how different queries decompose and their effect on query times Further in Section III we discussed our use of random partitions to spread out data across the tablet servers to increase participation in returning queries During our initial testing when we adopted the binning strategy with 100 bins we noticed a sizable performance increase but we do not yet have conclusive results regarding a recommended ratio of bins to tablet servers In Section II-B we reason that our key design maps geotime into a linear z order by interleaving temporal sub-bands and geohashes Based on the resolution of a queryês time component different key designs may perform differently This is close to the idea of comparing spatial queries to the storage geohash resolution If similar queries can be predicted ahead of time these studies would help inform key design Since potential database use might be unknown we are also actively pursuing ideas which would help use create functionality akin to Postgresês VACUUM ANALYZE We have used the tools that were developed as part of the indexing scheme to implement a nearest-neighbor operator There already exist good R tree algorithms for returning k nearest-neighbors efìciently b u t the challenge is to develop a good approach for a distributed key-value store Our current operator accepts a query point and a bounding polygon interval pair and will return zero or more points that satisfy those constraints by aggregating the results server side Each tablet computes its nearest-neighbor to the query point and returns that to the client The client nds the actual nearest neighbor by computing the minimum of the relatively few results We are investigating a number of reìnements to this nearest-neighbor approach but the existing implementation serves as proof-of-concept that the library is adequate to support a rich variety of geo-time algorithms Spatial transformations such as projection/reprojection distance queries and translations can all be implemented on top of the iterator chain by stacking additional operations that perform the desired computation R EFERENCES  2d Inde x e s MongoDB Manual 2.4.4 http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/2d Online accessed 20June-2013  Burton H Bloom Space/time trade-of fs in hash coding with allo w able

feature named allows Walter to provide strong guarantees while performing replication asynchronously In Walter nodes within a datacenter observe transactions on a consistent snapshot with global ordering while nodes across sites only have to follow causal ordering COPS is another k e y-v alue storage system for GD data COPS is highly scalable and can enforce causal dependencies The main strategy of COPS consists in enforcing causal dependencies between keys before writes are exposed VII C ONCLUSIONS The cloud computing paradigm provides a partial response to data challenges Clouds are however implemented by concrete datacenters whose geographical location matter and no single datacenter can host all the data in the world reliably and efìciently The current toolchain has to mature by considering real-life constraints such as geographical distribution or administrative domains This paper has presented Rout a data processing language capable of expressing programs involving datasets from multiple datacenters including individual datasets that are partitioned across datacenters As illustrated by our empirical evaluation even on GD data processing programs compiled to few MapReduce stages Rout is able to reduce the execution time down to half compared to a straightforward schedule which consolidates all data rst At the same time Rout exposes only little geo-distribution to programmers We are currently exploring further copy heuristics and datacenter selection policies than those presented in Section IV the integration of access control for multi-domain setups and the integration our GD model with other dataîow languages R EFERENCES  Y  Y u M Isard D Fetterly  M Budiu U Erlingsson P  K Gunda and J Currey DryadLINQ A System for Generalpurpose Distributed Data-parallel Computing Using a Highlevel Language in
