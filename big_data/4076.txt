The paper presents the implementation of an association rules discovery data mining task using Grid technologies. A result of implementation with a comparison of classic apriori and distributed apriori is also discussed Distributed data mining systems provide an efficient use of multiple processors and databases to speed up the execution of data mining and enable data distribution To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system, performance analysis of apriori and predictive apriori algorithms on a centralized database have been given using weka tool. The main aim of grid computing is to give organizations and application developers the ability to create distributed computing environments that can utilize computing resources on demand. Therefore, it can help increase efficiencies and reduce the cost of computing networks by decreasing data processing time and optimizing resources and distributing workloads, thereby allowing users to achieve much faster results on large operations and at lower costs. In this paper distributed apriori association rule on grid based environment is mined and the knowledge obtained is interpreted  Keywords Distributed data mining DDM\ Apriori algorithm, Grids, Predictive apriori, Association rule, frequent item set mining I INTRODUCTION Data mining has attracted a great deal of attention in the information industry and in society as a whole in recent years, due to wide availability of huge amounts of data and the imminent need for turning such data into useful information and knowledge. Data mining refers to extracting or ìminingî knowledge from large amounts of data Distributed data mining \(DDM\s data mining where the data and computation are spread over many independent sites.  Each site has its own data source and data mining algorithms producing local models F r o m t h e m g l o b a l  meaningful knowledge has to be derived The Grid is a distributed computing infrastructure that enables coordinated resource sharing within dynamic organizations 978-1-4244-6589-7/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE Association rules are used to show the relationships between data items with support and confidence measurements [9 The Weka Experiment Environment enables the user to create, run, modify, and analyse experiments in a more convenient manner than is possible when processing the schemes individually. For example, the user can create an experiment that runs several schemes against a series of datasets and then analyse the results to determine if one of the schemes is \(statistically\ better than the other schemes Based on these concepts the study is being carried out in the subsequent headings II MINING FREQUENT PATTERNS Frequent patterns are patterns that occur frequently in data. There are many kinds of frequent patterns, including item sets, subsequences and substructures S uppo s e a s a  marketing manager of A llElectronics would like to determine which items are frequently purchased together with the same transactions. An example of such a rule mined from the AllElectronics transactional database is Buys\(X,îComputer  buys\(X,îSoftware support=1%,confidence h e r e X i s a v a r i a b l e  representing a customer. A confidence, or certainty, of 50 means that if a customer buys a computer, there is a 50 chance that she will buy software as well. A 1% support means that 1% of all of the transactions under analysis showed that computer and software were purchased together. The above rule can be simply written as computer=>software [1  A Apriori  Algorithm Apriori is a seminal algorithm proposed by R.Agrawal and R.Srikant in 1994 from mining frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules. It is based on the fact that the algorithm uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties [2  A p r i o r i e m p l o y s an  ite r a tiv e ap p r o a c h k n o w n  as a level-wise search, where k-itemsets are used to explore k+1\ itemsets. First the set of frequent 1 itemsets is found by scanning the database to accumulate the count for each 


2 item, and collecting those items that satisfy minimum support. The resulting set is denoted L 1 Next L 1 is used to find L 2 the set of frequent 2- itemsets, which is used to find L 3 and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets can be found. The finding of each L k requires one full scan of the database. To improve the efficiency of the level-wise generation of frequent itemsets, an important property called the Apriori property [all nonempty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent   i s u s ed t o r e d u ce th e s ear ch  space. The 3 tw o s e t p r o c es s is f o llo w e d co n s is ti n g o f  j o in  and prune actions The join step: To find L k a set of candidate kitemsets is generated by joining L k-1 with itself. This set of candidates is denoted C k Let l 1 and l 2 be itemset in l k-1  After a series of process the resulting itemset formed by joining l 1 and l 2 is l 1   l 1 2 l 1 k-2 l 1   l 2   The prune step: C k is a superset of L k that is, its members may or may not be frequent, but all of the frequent k-itemsets are included in C k A scan of the database to determine the count of each candidate in C k would result in the determination of  L k i.e. all candidates having a count no less than the minimum support count are frequent by definition, and therefore belong to L k  To reduce the size of C k the Apriori property is used as follows. Any \(k-1\temset that is not frequent cannot be a subset of a frequent k-itemset. Hence, if any \(k1\ subset of a candidate k-itemset is not in L k-1 then the candidate cannot be frequent either and so can be removed from C k  B Predictive  Apriori Algorithm The Predictive Apriori algorithm [7 r et u r n s an  array best [1 . . .n o f as s o c i atio n  r u le s   x i y i   x i y i  a1, . . . , ak}, xi  yi  says that any rule not included in best is either less accurate than the n-th best rule best[n   or it is subsumed by an at least equally accurate rule that is contained in best C DDM Using Grid Architecture A possible infrastructure for a virtual organisation implemented using Grid technologies, is presented in Figure. 1 The company has a central branch and several local branches \(LB\. Each branch is composed of a number of Grid nodes \(GN\ interconnected in a Grid infrastructure In the case study [1  t h e d a t a  m i n i n g ta s k i s th e discovery of the association rules in the local branch databases, and the implementation of the Grid infrastructure is based on the Globus toolkit. In the OGSA context, the association rules discovery task is exposed in the form of Grid services. The mining service has several components specific to a Grid service: service data access, service data element, and service implementation The association rules discovery service is interacting with the rest of the grid services: service registry, service creation, authorisation notification, manageability and concurrency. The Apriori Grid Service must comply with OGSA rules, constraints standard interfaces and behaviour The service data access contains a standard interface and a discovery service, for registering information about Grid service instances with registry services. The client application calls the standard method FindServiceData, which retrieves service information from individual Apriori Grid Service instances. The service data access defines a standard interface and semantics for dynamic service creation of the Apriori Grid Service located at the Service Data Element level Figure 1. Virtual organisation infrastructure using grid technologies In the case study, from the central branch the association rules discovery task has to be launched, mining the data from central and local branches It is a distributed framework for mining associative rules in geographic distributed databases. The framework implements VO structure and it uses data mining methods and techniques and different technologies like Grid [8  J a v a an d  r e l a ti o n a l  databases The client module allows the user to send the parameters and the commands to the rest of the components Configuration parameters of the framework and of the Apriori algorithm, then call the mining methods. The client finds and creates the Apriori Grid Service and sends it the parameters for: locating and connecting to the remote transaction databases, locating the transaction tables or calling the pre-processing methods, Apriori algorithm minimum support and confidence, locating the knowledge base with the partial rules generated In the next step, the Apriori Grid Service instances perform the association rules discovery task independently on the remote databases, located on the Central Branch or   LB Gn LB GN GN GN LB GN GN GN LB GN GN GN Central branch GN GN GN GN GN GN 


3 on the Local Branches of the VO. The user/client application receives notifications when an association mining service completes its job and the results can be explored from the knowledge base. The user can explore the partial association rules generated or can apply incremental methods to combine the partial rules into more general rules The Apriori Grid Service implements an original Apriori library for mining the associative rules. The library is implemented in Java for portability and compatibility with the implementation [1 o f th e G l o b u s 3 To o l k it C o r e  services and, in this phase, it contains the serial version of the algorithm The implementation of the algorithm follows the next steps  finds all 1-itemsets candidates and all frequent 1itemsets candidates \(a candidate is an item set to be counted  then finds all frequent 2-itemsets  then generates a hash tree structure for storing the k-itemsets  the algorithm multiple scans the database and does not load it in the memory, which is very useful for large databases D Results Of Apriori And Predictive Apriori Algorithms The apriori and its advancement of predictive apriori algorithms are run using weka toolkit on a centralised database.. The results are given in Figure.2 and Figure.3 Comparison of two algorithms is like  Pred. Apriori mines a higher quality set of rules  Pred. Apriori needs fewer rules  But  pred. Apriori is slower than Apriori For discussion 2 samples have been taken , APriori gives confidence level of 1 and predictive apriori gives accurate confidence level of 0.9 Apriori 1 tear-prod-rate=reduced 12 ==> contactlenses=none 12    conf:\(1 2 contact-lenses=soft 5 ==> astigmatism=no 5 conf:\(1 Figure.2.

First of all, the sequential standalone implementation of the Apriori algorithm, called by the Apriori Grid Service, and a classical implementation Weka library\ were compared. The organisation of the datasets was given in the form èèTxxIyyDzzzKêê, where 


5 xxêê denotes the average number of items present per transaction, èèyyêê denotes the average support of each item in the dataset and èèzzzKêê denotes the total number of transactions in èèKêê \(1000 s\. The experiments were performed for 4 database sizes \(3000, 7000, 10,000 and 50,000 transactions\nd the resulting rules resulted had 30%, 25% and 20% support factors \(given in  Figure. 6 Figure. 6. Comparison of results The efficiency of the Apriori Grid Service algorithm compared with the classical Apriori is presented in the figure 6 which shows an improvement in performance for the Grid version of the association algorithm compared to the classical Apriori of 25% for 30% support, and it increased to about 27% for 25% support and to 31% for 20% support, all for the larger dataset \(10 k transactions Also, a series of distributed tests using the èèVirtual Organizationêê implemented on the local intranet were performed [1  T h e te s t c a lle d t h e A p r i o r i G r id S e r v ic e  w ith  different series of parameters \(remote databases, algorithm support and confidence factors, rules generated\and accurate results in real time have been obtained CONCLUSION This paper presents a study on results of Apriori and predictive apriori algorithms on a centralized database using weka toolkit. A comparison is also made which shows how distributed associative rule mining apriori algorithm works better than previous classical models whose results have been given The future scope of this work is that parallel distribution of knowledge extraction could be made on a distributed grid environment to produce a more optimized result REFERENCES 1 Cristian Aflori , Mitica Craus Grid implementation of the Apriori algorithm Science direct, Oct 2006 2 Aparna S Varde, Makiko Takakshi, Elke A Rundensteiner Mathew O ward Apriori algorithm and game-of-life for predictive analysis in materials science International journal of  knowledge based and intelligent engineering systems 8\(2004 3 Jiawei Han and Micheline Kamber Data mining, Concepts and techniques Morgan Kaufmann publishers, 2006 4 Azzedine Boukerche Kaiyuan Lu Optimized Dynamic Gridbased DDM Protocol for Large-scale Distributed simulation Systems  Proceedings of the 19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 2005 5 U.

Moreover we can say that F C is comparable to E C and the modi\002ed version of E C i.e vE C  is correct and effective  The combinations of F C  E C  and vE C with 006 conf improve slightly F C  E C  vE C  and 006 conf  We can say that the sum of con\002dences is an important measure and these combined measures are useful in particular in the context where the accuracies of the classi\002cation by the sum of con\002dence by F C  and by E C are almost very good For conclusions 002rstly the adapted weight of evidence is a good class membership measure built on the gain of information F C  a measure built on the revisited 037 2 test provides another view of information gain It is comparable to the adapted weight of evidence The sum of con\002dence is a simple and natural measure with the good performance The combinations of the sum of con\002dence with the previous measures are interesting and useful to improve their performance Next based on the average accuracy values of different measures we recommend to use the combined measures because the average accuracy values of the combined measures are in general better than that of the non-combined measures Finally through the results on each dataset between the combined measures based on 037 2 and the weight of evidence we suggest the following propositions 017 For the 13 small datasets though the average accuracy value of cE C is slightly better than that of cF C  we can observe that cF C is much often wins cE C  Indeed cE C wins cF C on only 3 datasets while cF C wins cE C on 6 datasets Hence we can recommend cF C for the small datasets 017 For the 10 large datasets the average accuracy value of cvE C is slightly better than that of cF C  and cvE C wins cF C on 4 datasets and cF C wins cvE C 3 datasets Hence we can recommend cvE C for large datasets References  B Lent A Sw ami and J W idom Clustering association rules Proc Intl Conf on Data Engineering ICDE'97 IEEE Computer Society 1997 pp 220-231  W  Li J Han and J Pei CMAR Accurate and Ef 002cient Classi\002cation based on multiple class-association rules Proc IEEE Intl Conf on Data Mining ICDM'01 San Jose CA IEEE Computer Society 2001 pp 369-376  B Liu W  Hsu and Y  Ma Inte grating Classi\002cation and Association Rule Mining Proc 4th Intl Conf on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD'98 AAAI Press 1998 pp 80-86  Y  Sun Y  W ang and A.K.C W ong Boosting an Association Classi\002er in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 18 no 7 IEEE Computer Society 2006 pp 988-992  J W ang and G Karypis HARMONY  Ef 002ciently Mining the Best Rules for Classi\002cation Proc SIAM Intl Conf on Data Mining SDM'05 2005 pp 205-216  J W ang and G Karypis On Mining Instance-Centric Classi\002cation Rules in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 18 no 11 2006 pp 1497-1511  Y  W ang and A.K.C W ong From Association to Classi\002cation Inference using Weight of Evidence in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 15 no 3 2003 pp 764-767  F  Coenen The LUCS-KDD Implementations of the FOIL PRM and CPAR algorithms http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk frans/KDD/Software/FOIL PRM CPAR/foilPrmCpar.html Computer Science Department University of Liverpool UK 2004  Y  Basti de R T aouil N P asquier  G Stumme and L Lakhal Mining Frequent Patterns with Counting Inferences in ACM SIGMOD Explorations vol 2 no 2 2000 pp 66-75  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules Proc 20th Intl Conf on Very Large Databases VLDB'94 Santiago Chile 1994 pp 487-499  V  Phan-Luong and R Messouci Building Classi\002ers with Association Rules based on Small Key Itemsets Proc 2nd IEEE International Conf on Digital Information Management ICDIM'07 France 2007 pp 200-205  J Quinlan and R Cameron-Jones FOIL A Midterm Report Proc European Conf on Machine Learning ECML'93 1993 pp 3-20  X Y in and J Han CP AR Classi\002cation based on Predicti v e Association Rules Proc 3rd SIAM Intl Conf on Data Mining SDM'03 San Francisco CA SIAM 2003 pp 369-376  C Cortes and V  V apnik Support-V ector Netw orks  in Machine Learning vol 20 no 3 1995 pp 273-297

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
