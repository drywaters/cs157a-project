Discovering and Ranking Important Rules Jiye Li School of Computer Science University of Waterloo Waterloo Ontario Canada N2L 3G1 j271i@uwaterloo.ca AbstractDecision rules generated from reducts can fully describe a data set We introduce a new method of evaluating rules by taking advantage of rough sets theory We consider rules generated from the original data set as attributes in the new constructed decision table Reducts generated from this new decision table contain essential attributes which are the rules Only important rules are contained in the reducts Experiments on an artificial data set and a medical data set 
show that the reduct rules are more important and this new method provides an automatic and effective way of ranking rules I INTRODUCTION Rough sets theory 1 is commonly used for attribute selection in decision making processes Efforts into applying rough sets theory to knowledge discovery in databases have focused on decision making data analysis discovering and characterizing the inter-data relationships and discovery interesting patterns 2 The decision table consists of condition attributes and decision attributes A reduct is a subset of condition attributes that can represent the whole data set Traditionally reduct generation is designed 
to extract important condition attributes from a decision table By considering fewer attributes the decision making process will become more efficient Association rule algorithm 3 is well known for finding associations e.g shopping behaviors among transaction data It can be used to extract rules from the decision table as well By specifying appropriate rule templates 4 rules with decision attributes are useful in decision making recommender systems and other applications The main problem with association rule algorithm is that too many rules are generated and it is difficult to analyze these rules and discover which ones are more important 
and interesting We show a new perspective of reduct Association rules are generated from the original decision table Each rule is considered as a condition attribute in the new constructed decision table The decision attributes are the original decision attributes Therefore a reduct of such a decision table represents the essential attributes which are the most important rules that fully describe the decision The rules contained by a reduct are therefore important and all the other rules are not as important and can be ignored The basic concept of rough sets and reduct are introduced in Section II Related works on 
association rules and rule discovery are discussed in Section HI In Section IV we Nick Cercone Faculty of Computer Science Dalhousie University Halifax Nova Scotia Canada B3H 1W5 nick@cs.dal.ca introduce the new method of constructing a decision table by considering rules as attributes Experiments on an artificial data set and a sanitized geriatric care data set are shown in Section V Conclusions and future work are discussed in Section VI II ROUGH SETS THEORY Rough sets theory was first introduced by Pawlak in the 1980's 1 An early application of rough sets theory to knowledge discovery systems was introduced to 
identify and remove redundant variables and to classify imprecise and incomplete information Most information system can be represented by a decision table with condition attributes describing the conditions and decision attributes describing the decisions when certain conditions are satisfied A decision table can be defined as T  U C D where U is the set of objects in the table C is the set of the condition attributes and D is the set of the decision attributes A reduct 1 of a decision table is a set of condition attributes that are sufficient to define the decision attributes A reduct does not contain redundant attributes It is often used in the attribute 
selection process There are more than one reduct for each decision table Finding all the reduct sets for a data set is NP-hard 5 Approximation algorithms are used to obtain a reduct set 6 The intersection of all the possible reducts is called the core The core is contained in all the reduct sets and it is the essential of the whole data Any reduct generated from the original data set cannot exclude the core attributes III RELATED WORK A Association Rule Association rule algorithms help finding patterns relating items in transactions For example in market basket analysis by analyzing transaction records from the market we could 
use association rule algorithms to discover different shopping behaviors For instance a customer who buys butter is most likely to buy bread Association rules can then be used to express these kinds of behaviors thus helping to increase the number of items sold in the market by arranging related items properly An association rule 3 is a rule of the form a of where a and 3 represent itemsets which do not share common items The association rule a  holds in the transaction set L with confidence c c  la 
 if c of transactions in L 0-7803-9017-2/05/$20.00 02005 IEEE 506 


that contain a also contain  Confidence gives a ratio of the number of transactions that the antecedent and the consequent appear together to the number of transactions the antecedent appears The rule a  3 has support s s ILI1 if s of transactions in L contain a U 3 Support measures how often the antecedent and the consequent appear together in the transaction set Here we call a antecedent and 3 consequent B Rule Template Klemettinen introduced the concept of rule templates 4 Properly defined rule templates can be helpful on generating desired association rules to be used in decision making and collaborative recommender systems 7 8 For example given condition attributes Attribute1 Attribute2  Attributen and decision attribute DecisionAttribute the following template specifies that only decision attributes can appear at the consequent of a rule and Attribute Attribute2  Attributen lead to a decision of DecisionAttribute Attributel Attribute2  Attributen DecisionAttribute We can also define templates to remove subsumed rules Given rule Attributel Attribute2 DecisionAttribute the following rules Attribute Attribute2 Attribute3 DecisionAttribute Attributel Attribute2 Attribute6 DecisionAttribute can be removed because they are subsumed Rules with only decision attributes on the consequent part can be used to make decisions We use these rule templates through our experiments C Rough Sets Theory and Rule Discovery There have been contributions on applying rough sets theory to rule discovery In 9 two modules were used in the association rule mining process for supporting organizational knowledge management and decision making A SelfOrganizing Map SOM was applied in the beginning to cluster sale actions based on the similarities in the characteristics of a given set of customer records Rough sets theory was then used on each cluster to find out some rules for association explanations In 10 Hassanien used rough sets to find all the reducts of data that contain the minimal subset of attributes associated With a class label for classification Then the author conducted classification based on the data set with reduced attributes Szczuka 11 proposed a new method of constructing a classification system with a rule-based system and neural networks Reducts were generated from the original data using rough sets theory then rules were generated according to the attributes in the reducts These rules were considered as attributes in the new constructed decision table The classifier constructed was smaller and simpler than rough sets classifier and the weights of the neural network implied the importance of particular rules Little effort to date has been expanded on applying rough sets theory to association rules generation Rough sets can be used to determine whether there is redundant information in the data and whether we can find the essential data needed for our applications Since the rough sets method can help to generate representative attributes we expect fewer rules will be generated due to fewer attributes And the rules will be as significant as the rules generated without using the rough sets approach D Recommender Systems A recommender system is an intelligent system that uses a database of known users profiles to predict a new user's interests There are two types of recommender systems contentbased recommender systems and collaborative filtering recommender systems 12 Content-based recommender systems make recommendations to new users based on the content of the available users interests Whereas collaborative filtering systems observe the behaviors and the patterns of the current users and make recommendations based on the similarities between the current users and other users A decision table can be constructed by considering user's interests as condition attributes and different recommended items as decision attributes Therefore association rules generated from this decision table with decision attributes on the consequent part can be used to make recommendations Rough sets theory can help making recommendations consequently By generating reducts of representative attributes only important attributes will be used for rule generation Association rules generation will become efficient and the extract rules are fewer but essential to make recommendations E Rule Importance Measure Previously Li and Cercone 13 proposed a new rule importance measure to evaluate association rules based on rough sets theory Multiple reducts are generated by the genetic algorithm from ROSETTA 14 rough sets package For each reduct the original data set is reconstructed by using the attributes in the reduct as condition attributes Multiple rule sets are generated for each new constructed data set by apriori 15 association rule algorithm The rules that occur more frequently among the multiple rule sets are considered to be more important Rule importance measure is defined as Number of times a rule appears in all reducts Number of reducts This measure is shown to be an effective way of automatically evaluating how important a rule is IV FINDING IMPORTANT RULES A general problem with rule generation is how to automatically extract important rules from the large number of generated rules how to extract only rules that can represent the whole knowledge base Let us consider the concept of a reduct A reduct of a decision table contains attributes that can fully represent the 507 


original knowledge If a reduct is given rules extracted based on this reduct are representative of the original decision table Can we take advantage of the concept of a reduct to discover important rules A Reconstruct Decision Table by Considering Rules as Attributes We consider a decision table T  U C D where U  uO,u1,...,Uml is a set of records in the table C  co C I cp1 is a set of the condition attributes and D is a set of the decision attributes Here we only consider decision tables with one decision attribute A set of rules R is generated from this table T where R  Ruleo Rule Rulen-1 The new decision table is constructed as following We construct a new decision table Amx\(n+1 where each record from the original decision table uO,uj,...,um_1 are the rows and the columns of this new table consists of Ruleo Rule1  Rule,,1 and the decision attribute We say a rule can be applied to a record in the decision table if both the antecedent and the consequent of the rule appear together in the record For each Rulej j E 0  n 1 we assign 1 to cell A[i j i E 0  m 1 if the rule Rulej can be applied to the record ui We set 0 to A[i j otherwise The decision attribute A[i n i E 0  m 1 remains the same as the original values of the decision attribute in the original decision table inconsistent 1 and incomplete records if there exists any Apriori 15 association rule algorithm is applied to generate association rules for each data set Since our interest is to make decisions we use the rule templates as defined in Section 11-B to only generate rule with decision attributes on the consequent part and to remove subsumed rules The new decision table is constructed by using these association rules as condition attributes We use Johnson's Reduct generation algorithm 2 in ROSETTA 14 on the new decision table to generate reduct Figure 1 shows the procedure of our experiment if j  n and Rulej can be applied to ui if j  n and Rulej cannot be applied to ui if j  n and di is the corresponding decision attributes for ui where i E O  m 1],j E O must be removed 2ROSETTA 14 GUI version 1.4.41 provides the following approximation algorithms for reduct sets generation Johnson's algorithm Genetic algorithm Exhaustive calculation and so on Johnson's algorithm retums one single reduct only with minimal length In our experiment we use Johnson's algorithm to generate reduct 508 I A[ij 0 di  n 1 Fig 1 Experiment Procedure B Reduct Rules and Core Rules We further define Reduct Rule Set and Core Rule Set Definition Reduct Rule Set We define a reduct generated from the new decision table A as Reduct Rule Set A Reduct Rule Set contains Reduct Rules The Reduct Rules are representative rules that can fully describe the decision attribute Definition Core Rule Set We define the intersection of all the Reduct Rule Sets generated from this new decision table A as Core Rule Set A Core Rule Set contains Core Rules The Core Rules are contained in every Reduct Rule Set By considering rules as attributes reducts generated from the new decision table contain all the important attributes which represent the important rules generated from the original data set and it excludes the less important attributes Core attributes from the new decision table A contain the most important attributes which represent the most important rules V EXPERIMENTS In our experiments we consider each data set as transaction set For each data set we first preprocess the data to remove We apply this experimental procedure to two sample data sets The first data set car data set is a small artificial data set designed to illustrate in detail our methodology The second data set geriatric care data is an actual data set from Dalhousie University Faculty of Medicine to determine the survival status of a patient It is used to illustrate that the methods we devised can scale to larger data sets A Car Data Set We first explain in detail our method of considering rules as attributes using an artificial data set about cars 16 shown in Table I which is used to decide the mileage of different cars This data set contains 14 records and 8 condition attributes There is no inconsistent data or incomplete data existing in this data set Rule templates defined in Section III-B are 1We first sort the whole data set according to the condition attributes excluding the decision attributes Then we select data records that contain the same condition attributes but different decision attributes These data records are inconsistent and they 


Medium High TABLE HI NEW DECISION TABLE FOR CAR DATA SET TABLE II RULES SET GENERATED BY CAR DATA SET applied e.g rules with only decision attribute mileage on the consequent part are generated and subsumed rules are removed There are 19 rules generated by apriori algorithm with support  1 conf idence  100 as shown in Table II The new decision table A14X20 is constructed by using the 19 rules as condition attributes and original decision on the mileage as the decision attribute For each rule we check whether it can be applied to the 19 records For example Ruleo USACar Displace-Medium,WeightMedium Mileage-Medium can be applied to the first record because both the antecedent USACar Displace-Medium Weight-Medium and the consequent Mileage-Medium appear in the rule Therefore we assign A[0 0  1 Ruleo can be applied to the second record as well We assign A[1 0  1 However Ruleo cannot be applied to the third record because the value for displace is small instead of medium Therefore A[2 0  0 Table III gives the new constructed decision table for car data set Note that we set Mileage-Medium to be 0 and Mileage-High to be 1 There is no inconsistency in this new decision table The core rule set generated by the core algorithm 17 is empty Johnson's Reduct generation algorithm generates TABLE I CAR DATA SET one reduct Ruleg Rulel6 TABLE IV RULE IMPORTANCE FOR CAR DATA SET Rule importance measure 13 provides a way to evaluate whether the reduct rules are more important Table IV shows the rule importance for the car data set Core attributes from the original data set are generated by the core algorithm The core for this data set are make model and trans From Table IV we can see that these two rules have rule importance of 100 and 75 respectively In Ruleg JapanCar is the core attribute and in Rule16 Trans-Manual is the core attribute The reduct rules Rules and Rule16 are more important and the reduct does not contain rules with low rule importance This example shows that by considering rules as attributes and constructing a new decision table reduct rules contain important rules and these reduct rules are representative knowledge of the original data set B Experiment on the Geriatric Data A sanitized geriatric care data set is tested This data set contains 8547 patient records with 44 symptoms and their survival status The data set is used to

We first check for inconsistency in this data set and 12 inconsistent data records are removed from this data set There are 86 reducts generated for this geriatric data set by the genetic algorithm in

we can make a further step in the rule extracting process by constructing decision table with more important rules The reduct rules may differentiate from those rules not in the reduct rule sets by being more significant VI CONCLUSION We introduced a new method to discover important rules by considering rules as attributes Association rules are used for rule generation A new decision table is constructed by considering all the rules as condition attributes Reducts rules generated by ROSETTA from this new decision table are representative of the original data set The experimental result for discovering important rules is promising and exciting The process of discovering important rules is automatic This method can be used together with rule importance measure 13 to take a further step to rank among the reduct rules In the future we plan to experiment on larger and more complex data sets We will consider trying rule shortening 11 for larger number of rules in order to process the larger decision tables The experimental results from the geriatric care data set imply we could further select significant rules among all the rules with the importance of 100 We would like to explore how to select more significant rules by our method We are also looking for new techniques that will combine the domain knowledge into finding important rules We would like to perform more experiments on recommender data set to apply our method on recommender systems ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council NSERC of Canada REFERENCES 1 Z Pawlak Rough Sets Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Data Norwell MA USA Kluwer Academic Publishers 1992 2 J Z Pawlak Grzymala-Busse R Slowinski and W Ziarko Rough sets in Communications of the ACM vol 38 New York NY USA November 1995 3 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules in Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases VLDB J B Bocca M Jarke and C Zaniolo Eds Morgan Kaufmann 12-15 1994 pp 487-499 4 M Klemettinen H Mannila P Ronkainen H Toivonen and A I Verkamo Finding interesting rules from large sets of discovered association rules in Third International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management CIKM'94 N R Adam B K Bhargava and Y Yesha Eds ACM Press 1994 pp 401-407 5 M Kryszkiewicz and H Rybinski Finding reducts in composed information systems in Proceedings of the International Workshop on Rough Sets Knowledge Discovery W Ziarko Ed 1993 pp 261-273 6 J Bazan H Nguyen S Nguyen P Synak and J Wroblewski Rough set algorithms in classification problem in Rough set methods and applications new developments in knowledge discovery in information systems Heidelberg Germany Physica-Verlag GmbH 2000 pp 49 88 7 J Li B Tang and N Cercone Applying association rules for interesting recommendations using rule templates in PAKDD 2004 pp 166-170 8 W Lin S Alvarez and C Ruiz Efficient adaptive-support association rule mining for recommender systems Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol 6 no 1 pp 83 105 2002 9 Z Huang and Y Hu Applying Al technology and rough set theory to mine association rules for supporting knowledge management in ICMLC 2003 10 A Hassanien Rough set approach for attribute reduction and rule generation A case of patients with suspected breast cancer JASIS vol 55 no 11 pp 954 962 2004 11 M S Szczuka Rules as attributes in classifier construction in RSFDGrC 1999 pp 492-499 12 M Balabanovic and Y Shoham Fab Content-based collaborative recommendation in Communications of the ACM vol 40 no 3 New York NY USA March 1997 pp 66-72 13 J Li and N Cercone A rough set based model to rank the importance of association rules in RSFDGrC 2005 14 A Ohm Discernibility and rough sets in medicine Tools and applications Ph.D dissertation Norwegian University of Science and Technology 1999 15 C Borgelt Efficient implementations of apriori and eclat in Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Melbourne FL USA November 2003 16 X Hu Knowledge discovery in databases an attribute-oriented rough set approach Ph.D dissertation University of Regina 1995 17 X Hu T Lin and J Han A new rough sets model based on database systems Fundamenta Informaticae vol 59 no 2-3 pp 135-152 2004 18 J Li and N Cercone Empirical analysis on the geriatric care data set using rough sets theory School of Computer Science University of Waterloo Technical Report CS-2005-05 2005 511

 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simpliìed to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no beneìt to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are deìned over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set  i 1       1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d        for 2  i   l  2  and  l  1 1       1  d  l  2   d  1 d         We term this hybrid strategy MinMaxLoad NWC for non-worstcase Commonality parameter  1 implies that locally frequent items are also globally frequent and SS2 modiìed to use  1   is a good choice Conversely  0 indicates that MinMaxLoad WC is a good choice For 0  1  a weighted mixture of the two strategies is best 2.1.5 Summary The precision gradient strategies we have introduced are summarized in Table 3 Sample precision gradients are illustrated in Figure 3 3

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
