Sparsity-based Representation for Categorical Data Remya Menon Shruthi S Nair Srindhya K M R Kaimal Department of Computer Science and Engineering Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Amritapuri Campus Kerala India Abstract 227Over the past few decades many algorithms have been continuously evolving in the area of machine learning This is an era of big data which is generated by different applications related to various 002elds like medicine the World Wide Web E-learning networking etc So we are still in need for more ef\002cient algorithms which are computationally cost effective and thereby producing faster results Sparse representation of data is one giant leap toward the search for a solution for big data analysis The focus of our paper is on algorithms for sparsitybased representation of categorical data For this we adopt a concept from the image and signal processing domain called dictionary learning We have successfully implemented its sparse coding stage which gives the sparse representation of data using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit OMP algorithms both Batch and Cholesky based and its dictionary update stage using the Singular Value Decomposition SVD We have also used a preprocessing stage where we represent the categorical dataset using a vector space model based on the TF-IDF weighting scheme Our paper demonstrates how input data can be decomposed and approximated as a linear combination of minimum number of elementary columns of a dictionary which so formed will be a compact representation of data Classi\002cation or clustering algorithms can now be easily performed based on the generated sparse coded coef\002cient matrix or based on the dictionary We also give a comparison of the dictionary learning algorithm when applying different OMP algorithms The algorithms are analysed and results are demonstrated by synthetic tests and on real data Index Terms 227sparse representation dictionary learning sparse coding cholesky decomposition OMP SVD I I NTRODUCTION M achine Learning algorithms have a very successful history in data analysis In this era of big data these algorithms have to compete with the volume aspect both in the number of data as well as dimensionality-wise So we need to devise new algorithms or extend the existing algorithms to suit the need of the hour The focus of our paper is to 002nd a solution which will ease the process of big data analysis by giving a compact representation and thereby also achieve computational cost effectiveness Also the data that is generated by different applications related to various 002elds like medicine the World Wide Web E-learning networking etc are mostly categorical in nature We focus our attention on an approach that is currently being adopted in the 002eld of image and signal processing called the sparsity-based representation We extend this approach to the categorical domain where data can be both single-valued as well as multi-valued set-valued The main objective of sparsity-based representation is to come up with the most compact representation of data so that it helps in ef\002cient memory utilization when used as input to different classi\002cation or clustering techniques The general notations that we use throughout the paper are uppercase letters  D H  to indicate matrices vectored lowercase letters  y 013  to indicate column vectors and lowercase letters to indicate size of the matrices and count of the elements We know that in the context of a linear equation solver if we have a set of equations in three unknowns  013 1  013 2  013 3  as given in Eqn 1  d 1 013 1  d 2 013 2  d 3 013 3  y 1 d 3 013 1  d 4 013 2  d 5 013 3  y 2 d 2 013 1  d 1 013 2  d 6 013 3  y 3 1 we can rewrite this using matrix representation as follows 2 6 4 d 1 d 2 d 3 d 3 d 4 d 5 d 2 d 1 d 6 3 7 5 2 6 4 013 1 013 2 013 3 3 7 5  2 6 4 y 1 y 2 y 3 3 7 5 2 Under a similar logic if we have a data item y 2  n  where n is the number of dimensions we can decompose it as in Eqn 3  y  D~\013 3 where D is the dictionary and 013 is a sparse coef\002cient vector To further illustrate this approach we 002rst need to de\002ne the relevance of D and 013  The dictionary D 2  n 002 k  is an n 002 k matrix where each of its k columns f  d i g k i 1  indicating a basis function can be linearly combined to generate y  013 2  k  where k is the number of dictionary columns is the coef\002cient vector which represents y using D  As it is so called the nonzero coef\002cients of 013 indicate which dictionary columns will be involved in the linear combination If we apply a minimum constraint on the number of non-zero values  l 0 norm of 013  we can also say that 013 indicates a sparse representation of y  a process which is well known as sparse coding By setting up a minimum constraint we are trying to achieve a reduction in the number of bases used to represent y  Vectors are often used to represent large amount of data which can be dif\002cult to store or transmit By using a sparse representation the amount of space needed to store the vector would be reduced to a fraction of what was originally needed Sparse representations can also be used to analyze data by showing how the column vectors in a given basis come together to regenerate the original data 2013 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems \(RAICS

y  If we know D and 013 we must be able to regenerate y  Due to the presence of noise or outliers in the data we can also say y 031 D~\013  Hence our objective function can be de\002ned as in Eqn 4  min 013 k 013 k 0 subject to k y 000 D~\013 k 2 024 017 4 where 017 is an error threshold that we need to recommend and k  k 2 is the l 2 norm Clustering techniques have adopted the l 2 norm to measure the extend of dissimilarity between two data items Likewise our intention is to measure such a dissimilarity and minimize it The sparse coding can be derived by using any one of the pursuit algorithms like the matching pursuit the focal underdetermined system solver FOCUSS the basis pursuit or the orthogonal matching pursuit\(OMP algorithm  In order to achie v e our objecti v e function dictionary convergence is necessary in addition to sparse coding The dictionary has to be learned using the techniques like singular value decomposition or the method of optimal directions MOD In a nutshell the goal of our paper is to have a sparse representation of categorical data performance comparison of dictionary learning with different sparse coding algorithms We achieve our goal using a preprocessing phase which represents the example categorical dataset as a vector space model dictionary learning phase which takes this input as vectors and iterates between two sub phases the sparse coding phase and the dictionary update phase until convergence in order to meet our objective function In the sparse coding phase we use the OMP and the Batch-OMP method where the orthogonalization is improved using the Cholesky decomposition For the dictionary update phase singular value decomposition SVD is adopted Here one column of the dictionary is updated in each iteration so that only one column needs to be pushed into the memory at a time thereby reducing memory utilization In Section 2 we refer to the recent work done in the 002eld of sparse-representation dictionary design and describe different algorithms that were proposed for this task Section 3 describes the solution approach the adopted methodologies algorithm used and its relation to previously proposed methods The results of the algorithm on different datasets and performance comparison of Batch-OMP against OMP-Cholesky using a same data set are presented in Section 4 The conclusion of our work is given in Section 5 II R ELATED W ORK Most of the related research work associated with our paper has its roots in the 002eld of signal and image processing This goes way back to the late 1980s when heavy research began in the area of signal compression 8 signal reconstruction v ector quantizati on 15 orthogonalization  linear in v erse problems machine learning algorithms for classi\002cation and clustering like the K-means expectationmaximization EM support vector machines and the like In signal and image processing sparse representation was looked into with the goal of denoising compression and inpainting 6 Dictionary learning is extensively used in the areas of information coding classi\002cation and face recognition Recent works include stage-wise K-SVD label-consistent K-SVD 2 and discriminative K-SVD All the three w ork to w ards image classi\002cation and face recognition  gi v es a frame w ork for incorporating both reconstruction and discrimination terms into dictionary learning All the above four approaches use the K-SVD algorithm for dictionary updates So we then focused our study to the implementation aspects of the K-SVD algorithm For this we concentrated on  6 4 discusses an ef 002cient implementation of K-SVD algorithm which both accelerates it and reduces its memory consumption The two basic components of the implementation are the replacement of the exact SVD computation with a much quicker approximation and the use of the BatchOMP method for performing the sparse-coding operations The paper describes various matching pursuit algorithms like OMP OMP-Cholesky and Batch-OMP The paper describes how the batch-OMP algorithm can handle large set of signals While gi v es more focus on the sparse coding phase of dictionary learning gi v es emphasis to the dictionary update phase designs the K-SVD algorithm as a generalization of K-means clustering.As these papers are successful in image classi\002cation we extend the K-SVD to the domain of categorical data Different pursuit algorithms have been proposed in the past for sparse coding gi v es an ele g ant collection of these algorithms as also mentioned in 11 Matching pursuit 11 and OMP are greedy algorithms that select the dictionary columns sequentially and computes the inner product with the signal to generate sparse coef\002cients It uses the l 0 norm describes a basis pursuit approach which replaces this l 0 norm with the l 1 norm is dif ferent from the pre vious papers by using the l p norm with p 024 1  In MOD the dictionary update is v ery simple If we kno w the sparse coef\002cient for a data item y i  then we can de\002ne the error as e i  y i 000 D x i  The overall mean square error is given by k E k 2 F  k Y 000 DX k 2 F  In a dictionary is composed of a union of orthonormal bases D   D 1  D 2   D L  where D j  j  1   L  are orthonormal matrices The residual matrix E j  is computed as E j  Y 000 P i 6  j D i X i  If we consider k E j 000 D j X j k 2 F as the penalty term then E j X T j  D j  Further E j X T j is decomposed using Singular Value Decomposition SVD Here update is only done to the dictionary and not to the sparse coef\002cient 013  Both and 6 use SVD for dictionary update but in the SVD is also used to update the sparse coef\002cient so as to enable faster convergence  gi v es an outline of the v ector space model QR f actorization

12  An error based stopping criteria is used in this algorithm as in step 5 and 016 is computed in step 15 for this purpose Squared approximation error 017 m is computed in step 16 by using the previous iteration's error 017 m 000 1 and by using previous and current iteration's 016 values We can set the target error 017  in terms of the initial error 017 0  which is given in step 2  We limit the number of coef\002cients 013 I  used to represent y using step 5  The practical implementation of Batch-OMP uses a progressive Cholesky decomposition method to reduce the work involved in inverting the matrix  H I;I  000 1  Here H I;I remains non-singular due to the orthogonalization process which ensures the selection of linearly independent atoms The matrix H I;I is an SP D symmetric positive-de\002nite matrix which is updated every iteration by simply appending a single row and column to it and therefore its Cholesky decomposition requires only the computation of its last row The third phase comprises the dictionary update The dictionary learning process requires a normalized initial dictionary D and a coef\002cient matrix A  Here the coef\002cient matrix is obtained from the sparse coding stage which is further used in the dictionary update stage The dictionary update process updates one column at a time 002xing all the remaining columns and 002nds a new column and its new coef\002cient values that reduce the mean squared error The new dictionary column and the new coef\002cients are obtained by the process of Singular Value Decomposition Mathematically the theorem is represented by the equation de\002ned in Steps 4 to 7 Algorithm 4  When all the dictionary columns get updated again sparse coding phase is done This process is iteratively done until a stopping criterion is reached according to the error constraint as given in Eqn 4  Each row of the coef\002cient matrix represents the corresponding dictionary column  d i and each of its columns represent a document y i in the weight matrix Y  In step 4 Algorithm 4  we consider each row of the coef\002cient matrix Row 2  N  to 002nd out the number of non-zero coef\002cient values This gives the group of documents that make use of that dictionary column Algorithm 4 has an effective sparse coding phase and it is more effective when the dimensions of data vectors are huge and when the dictionary size is large IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS Experiments have been carried out using the algorithms applied on both the synthetic and real data The implementation of the dictionary learning algorithm has been carried out with both OMP-Cholesky and Batch-OMP algorithms in the sparse coding stage All the algorithms mentioned in this paper are implemented in Java As the real dataset has above 10,000 terms generated from above 900 documents records from a medical dataset as given in Table I we are demonstrating the experimental results using a sample set of data Fig 2 Preprocessed data from the sample biological dataset Fig 3 Generated dictionary from the sample biological dataset To demonstrate the regeneration of data on the biological dataset we took a sample of 7 documents and 8 terms to form the 8 002 7 data matrix as per Fig 2 The dictionary generated for this data is shown in Fig 3 The corresponding coef\002cient matrix is given in Fig 4 The regenerated data matrix with a very small reconstruction error frobenius norm of 0.761 is shown in Fig 5 For the objective of comparison of dictionary learning algorithm using OMP-Cholesky and Batch-OMP algorithms Fig 4 Generated coef\002cient matrix from the sample biological dataset Fig 5 Regenerated data using the above dictionary and coef\002cient matrix 78

Each tuple in relations and consists of a 64-bit key and a 64-bit payload We compare the performance of Distribute Bitmap Join and no-partition hash join algorithm from two aspects One is to compare the running time of both algorithms under different overlap ratios The other is to compare the running time of both algorithms with different number of threads The result of comparison between Distributed Bitmap Join and no-partition hash join algorithms when the overlap ratio of query set ranging from 40 percents to 100 percents is shown in Fig 1 The performance of Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm is better than no-partition hash join In addition the running time keeps decreasing when the overlap ratio becomes larger On the other hand there is almost no change of execution time for no-partition hash join when overlap ratio changes It is because hash join algorithm itself is not affected by overlapped queries If we consider both Join algorithms as two phases build phase which includes establishing dictionaries bitmaps and hash indexes and join phase which includes matching tuples then the execution time can be divided into two parts which is shown in Fig 2 When the overlap ratio increases the running time for both build phase and join phase of Distributed Bitmap Join decreases continuously while a little bit increase appears in build phase of no-partition hash join For join phase of our algorithm the running time decrease is due to the utilization of intermediate results which reduces both computation cost and communication cost of join operations while the decrease for build phase can be attributed to the reuse of various structures e.g the bitmaps and dictionaries As long as one join operation between relation and relation has been done there is no need for creating dictionaries and bitmaps any more Thus the amortization of computation cost in build phase leads to a relative high performance overall Moreover the increase in build phase of no-partition hash join is because relation is larger than relation  Fig 3 shows the execution time of both algorithms when different number of threads are used In this experiment there is no change of the size of relations and every relation is divided into equal sized runs among all threads From the gure we can see clearly that the performance of Distributed Bitmap Join becomes worse with increasing thread number while that of no-partition hash join becomes better The performance deterioration in join phase of Distributed Bitmap Join is due to the increase in communication cost Since the communication cost is  increase in causes increase in communication cost The degradation in build phase on the other hand can be attributed to the increasing computation cost when creating bitmaps and dictionaries Although Distributed Bitmap Join is worse than no-partition hash join in Fig 3 we emphasize here that the focus of our algorithm is the optimization of a group of queries instead of just one single query In fact the major reason for performance degradation of Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm is that it has to build bitmaps and dictionaries for all threads When it comes

to a group of queries this cost can be amortized among all queries and thus optimize the overall performance which was illustrated in Fig 1 The experimental results show that even though Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm is worse than no-partition hash join for one single query it outperforms no-partition hash join for a group of queries In addition because it is not sensitive to data skew problem Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm performs better in this case VI CONCLUSION With the advance in hardware technology as well as growing demands for real-time response for database application IMDB becomes the central focus in this eld Because of its architectural advantages NUMA which is designed for multi-core system such that each processor accesses its local memory faster than shared memory effectively solves the memory-access related starvation problem In this paper we propose a Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm which aims at optimizing join one of the most expensive operations in database applications by reducing the communication cost and reusing of intermediate results The comparison with nopartition hash join shows that our method outperforms the competitor in terms of execution time for a group of queries The performance also improves with the increase of overlap ratio of query set This work is partially supported by Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project No B412 National Science Foundation of China under grunt No.61003069 No.61033007 and No.60925008 National 973 program under grant No.2010CB731402 R EFERENCES  S Ne gash Business intelligence

  9 example, when plotting the values of a parameter, it is possible to display the histogram chart of the same parameter on the same period of time, or to select one telemetry occurrence and display the corresponding time on a synoptic, or on a planisphere, etc IMIS Smartphone application IMIS is also an application that runs on any Android compatible platforms whether a smartphone or a tablet. It communicates with the same server than the rich client application to retrieve the information to display The IMIS smartphone application is mainly designed for oncall operations and therefore only contains a subset of the IMIS functionalities. The most important function with regard to on-call operations is the management of alarms Thanks to the native notification system available on Android, IMIS can warn users when a new alarm have been detected. The phone \(or tablet\ibrates and emits a beep until the user views the alarm. Users can then display any details about the alarm \(telemetry parameter in alarm monitoring rule that is transgressed, start date, etc.\hen the cause of the alarm is identified, users can acknowledge it from the smartphone In order to help users analyzing the alarm, IMIS provides a very convenient function: the plot of telemetry parameters over a configurable period of time. Not only can users plot the parameter in alarm, but up to four parameters can be displayed simultaneously on the same graph or on separate graphs. The list of available parameters is defined in the satellite database that is retrieved from the server An other interesting feature allows user to display the satellite ground track at the same period of an alarm, using the Google Map application provided with the Android system Finally, thanks to the Andro\357d native SMS and mail applications, IMIS can send messages with valuable information about the alarm: text, alarm details, screenshots of charts, etc A set of screenshots of IMIS Smartphone application is provided in Figure 5  5  IMIS  D ESIGN  Client / server architecture for desktop application The IMIS client / server architecture is a Service Oriented Architecture. It ensures flexibility \(services are independent of each other\d adaptability to changes thanks to the clear separation between the business logic and the \221services\222 interface layer. New services can then be implemented to meet specific requirements of a space mission without strong modification of the IMIS architecture or impact on other missions   Figure 5. IMIS Android application 


  10 In IMIS software, the communication layer is implemented by a component named \221channel\222. The channel defines the services with their input and output data \(i.e. the API of the communication layer\he channel also provides an implementation of the communication layer that is described here-after Different modes of interactions between the clients and the server are implemented. With asynchronous services the service invocation is not blocking. This interaction mode is extended to deal with operations such as \221Progress\222 enabling to continuously receive the results as work progresses on the server side Synchronous services are characterized by the client invoking a service and then waiting for a response to the request. Because the client suspends its own processing after making its service request, synchronous services are suited when the service can process the request in a short time or when a small amount of data is returned. Finally, a last interaction mode is implemented to manage notifications from the server to one or more clients. The clients first subscribe to one or several events. When such an event occurs, the server notifies the client These three interaction modes highlight the exchange of data that are initiated by the client \(synchronous and asynchronous calls\y the server \(asynchronous callbacks and notifications\ever, the technical solution must also take into account the following security constraints: the link between the clients and the server shall be able to pass through firewalls and proxies that only allow HTTP connection and the communication shall be initiated by the client As a consequence, the channel is implemented using RPC Remote Procedure Call\digm with two transport-layer protocols 200  Java RMI \(Remote Method Invocation\: this implementation is convenient for IMIS deployment in an Intranet that allows the transfer of Java serialized objects 200  HTTP-Tunneling RMI: the Java serialized objects are encapsulated in an HTTP request / response so that they can be transferred over the Internet The principle of the HTTP tunnel, pictured in Figure 6  consists in inserting an HTTP relay to route the RMI traffic via HTTP POST requests. The relay is a Java Servlet container \(e.g. Apache Tomcat\at receives RMI requests and transfers them to the RMI server. A variant of this approach is to integrate RMI services directly in the Servlet container in order to improve performance on the encoding and network traffic    Figure 6. HTTP tunneling Finally, because only the clients are able to initiate the communication, the notification mechanism used for example to notify clients when new alarms are raised, is the following: the client frequently queries the server to know if any new event has occurred  Client / server architecture for smartphone client The IMIS smartphone client is an Android application written in Java. Note that in the Android platform, there is no Java Virtual Machine: Java classes are compiled into Dalvik executables and run on Dalvik which is a specialized virtual machine designed specifically for Android Unfortunately, all the Java API is not supported by Dalvik in particular Java RMI can not be used Another transport layer has then been set-up to make the communication between IMIS server and smartphone client possible, as depicted in Figure 7 The services are implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST Representational State Transfer\EST is a style of software architecture for distributed systems in which all services are defined as resources that can be accessed via HTTP methods \(GET, PUT, POST and DELETE\The resources are thus identified by their URI \(which enables to access the service\nd the internet media type of the data transferred \(e.g. XML, JSON\. IMIS uses the JSON format which is less verbose than XML. This is a very important criterion because data are transferred through the mobile network that has a limited bandwidth \(in theory 2 Mbits/s but in practice around 400 Kbits/s Moreover, in REST architectures, the services are stateless between requests. It means that the services do not carry any session state on behalf of the clients that are not currently in the process of making requests. All information about the session state must then be transmitted each time a request is made. One example of this point in IMIS is the session ID that is provided when a user is connected \(with its login password\he session ID is first retrieved by calling the authentication service and then transferred as a parameter of all subsequent requests \(such as the retrieval of telemetry values Another point that is not directly related to REST architecture is the way IMIS is notified when new alarms occur. Even if Google provides a framework named Cloud 


  11 to Device Messaging \(C2DM\ieve this goal, IMIS does not use it. On the one hand, for satellite on-call operations, CNES does not want to be dependent of a thirdparty that is not clearly committed to a certain level of quality of service. On the other hand, CNES does not want to provide any third-party with information about the monitoring and health status of the satellites it operates The notification mechanism that is implemented is thus a frequent query of the server to know if any new alarm has raised. The frequency can be tuned to avoid a huge number of connections limiting the available bandwidth and the battery life 6  T ECHNOLOGIES  Java is the programming language selected for developing IMIS because of the IMIS di stributed architecture and the complexity of the IMIS GUI. Java applications can run on any Java Virtual Machine regardless of the computer architecture. Java is also the language for developing on Android platform. Finally Java development environment offers a great number of APIs \(Application Programming Integrated Development Environment frameworks and a continuous integration environment. One particular API that is used in IMIS is Java RMI Remote Method Invocation\ which enables to create distributed Java technology-based applications, in which the methods of remote Java objects can be invoked from other Java virtual machines, possibly on different hosts. Java RMI is the technology used to implement the IMIS channel PostgreSQL is the object-relational database management system used to store all persistent information of IMIS except telemetry parameters values which, for performance reasons, are stored in binary files using a CNES proprietary technology named \223 TelemetryTable 224. The principle of the 223TelemetryTable\224 is to store the telemetry covering a specified period \(typically one day\ in a binary file with an extensible time index. Each file is self sufficient in the sense that it includes a description of its own data dictionary necessary to read / write the data blocks. The advantages of this binary structure that is temporally indexed are its minimum disk space footprint \(data are not encoded in ASCII\d the optimal performance for inserting and retrieving data on a time criterion IMIS desktop application It remains to present the technology best suited to implement the GUI of IMIS rich client application. Swing naturally comes to mind as this technology is an integral part of the standard Java API. But an interesting alternative was chosen: the Standard Widget Toolkit \(SWT\ and more specifically the EclipseRCP technology \(based on SWT and JFace\eRCP technology enables developers to implement with a good productivity, highly interactive and user-friendly applications. Indeed, the Eclipse framework provides a very mature architecture with reusable components and standard user interactions \(such as drag and drop, windows docking, online help etc.\The architecture is based on plugins that can be made available gradually throughout the development phase. Moreover, as a generic tool IMIS has to take into account the specificities of every mission it operates and the modular architecture of EclipseRCP offered the possibility to add or remove plug-ins depending on the user requirements To illustrate the architecture based on reusable components we can mention the integration of four components in the IMIS client 200  BIRT is an open source Eclipse-based reporting system that IMIS uses to produce health reports  200  CSS is an integrated control system based on the Eclipse environment. IMIS uses CSS to display and animate synoptics 200  uDig is an open source desktop application framework built with EclipseRCP. The goal of uDig is to provide a complete Java solution for desktop GIS data access editing, and viewing. uDig is used as a plug-in in IMIS to display a map with the satellite ground tracks and stations  200  JFreeChart is a free Java chart library that makes it easy for developers to display professional quality charts in their applications. JFreeChart is compatible with both Swing and SWT making it possible to integrate into an EclipseRCP application [12   If the use of COTS dramatically reduces the development cost of a new software, it is often necessary to optimize the integrated library in order to fit the end users need. For instance, in IMIS development,  a particular attention was paid on optimizing JFreeChart performances IMIS smartphone application With regard to the smartphone part of the software, it was a good opportunity to check the capabilities of mobile platforms to develop a professional application. On the one hand all features necessary to the smartphone development were available and well-functioning on the Android platform. But on the other hand, it should be noted that the development faced a rapid evolution of the Android operating system two major releases within 6 months Fi g ure 7. IMIS smart p hone communication 


  12 Moreover no mature chart API was found even though a beta version of a library named aFreeChart was used successfully and works pretty well Finally, the Google Map application provided with the Android system was used to display the satellite ground track 7  C ONCLUSION  The development of IMIS server and desktop client ended in November 2011. Since late 2011, IMIS has been deployed in the MSL payload control center and has been integrated into SSALTO. Operators, science teams, and experts from CNES and French/American laboratories involved in the MSL project have a very good feeling about the software IMIS meet the requirements of two different missions \(Earth observation and Mars exploration\ that at a first glance are supposed to have distinct operational procedures to monitor the instruments. This was possible because IMIS was designed as a generic software that provides the base functionalities and an extensible architecture MICROSCOPE and SWOM are the next missions that intend to use IMIS in their payload control centers [13   Technologies and software design concepts are now mature and allow to implement distributed Web architecture. In terms of information system security, no specific difficulty was encountered. The lessons learnt are to consider upstream the security constraints. In most of cases it is sufficient to apply the state of the art in matter of security network segmentation and isolation, system hardening, and application security \(use of security guidelines and best practices from CNES and partners: authentication, traces and security logs, restricted privileges, input/output data checking, etc The smartphone application is currently in the last stages of development. A prototype was developed in 2011 and presented to end-users. It has validated the operators\222 interest in a mobile application that allows to remotely monitor the payload instruments. IMIS android application has raised a lot of interest and its use is now being considered for the MSL mission IMIS offers new functionalities and possibilities for on-call operations that have been requested by operators for a long time. However, as it is not yet used in an operational context, there is currently no lesson learnt about the real advantage of using such a tool.  Moreover, the deployment of the smartphone client requires further analyses: definition of security procedures relative to professional usage of smartphones, modification of the operational procedures because the way on-call operations are realized, is modified with such an interactive tool that provides means to remotely analyze and acknowledge alarms, etc R EFERENCES    Wi en s et al 2012  T h e C h e m C a m I n s t r u m e n t Su i t e  on the Mars Science Laboratory \(MSL\Rover: Body Unit and Combined System Tests.
