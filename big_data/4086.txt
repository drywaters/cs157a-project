Email charu@us.ibm.com Abstract Conservative estimates place the amount of data expected to be created by mankind this year to exceed several thousand exabytes Given the enormous data deluge and in spite of recent advances in main memory capacities there is a clear and present need to move beyond algorithms that assume in-core main-memory computation One fundamental task in Information Retrieval and text analytics requires the maintenance of local and global term frequencies from within large enterprise document corpora This can be done with a counting hash-table they associate keys to frequencies In this paper we will study the design landscape for the development of such an out-of-core counting hash table targeted at ash storage devices Flash devices have clear bene“ts over traditional hard drives in terms of latency of access and energy ef“ciency However due to intricacies in their design random writes can be relatively expensive and can degrade the life of the ash device Counting hash tables are a challenging case for the ash drive because this data structure is inherently dependent upon the randomness of the hash function frequency updates are random and may incur random expensive random writes We demonstrate how to overcome this challenge by designing a hash table with two related hash functions one of which exhibits a data placement property with respect to the other Speci“cally we focus on three designs and evaluate the trade-offs among them along the axes of query performance insert and update times and I/O time using real-world data and an implementation of TF-IDF I I NTRODUCTION Advances in technology have enhanced our ability to produce and store data at very large scales The sheer volume of data being generated is increasingly hampering our ability to manage retrieve and subsequently analyze such data to derive actionable knowledge and information McKinsey Global Institute estimated that companies from all sectors in United States have at least 100 TBs of stored data per company and many have more than 1 PB A sizable fraction of this data is textual in nature Examples abound ranging from data produced by nancial services to data collected in administrative parts of government from customer transaction histories maintained by retail and wholesale organizations to large private enterprise document collections from large-scale Internet repositories like Wikipedia to online content generated by social networking and microblogging sites like Facebook and Twitter Given this data deluge it is becoming increasingly clear that traditional data management information retrieval and mining algorithms must be enhanced via ef“cient disk aware data structures Of particular interest in this context are recent advances in storage technology that have led to the development of ash devices These devices have several advantages over traditional hard drives HDD such as lower energy requirements faster random and sequential seek times because of a lack of moving parts 5 Due to the superior access performance ash devices have been utilized in enterprise database applications as a write cache to impro v e latenc y  page dif ferential logging 20 and also as an intermediate structure to improve the ef“ciency of migrate operations in the storage layer Ho we v e r  the writes to the dri v e can v ary in speed depending upon the scenario Sequential writes are quite fast though random writes and updates can be signi“cantly slower The reason for this is the level of granularity of erasing and updating data on such devices An important property of the ash drive is that it supports only a nite number of erasewrite cycles after which the blocks on the drive may wear out The different trade-offs in read-write speed leads to a number of challenges for information retrieval applications especially those in which there are frequent in-place updates to the underlying data The hash table is a widely used data structure in modern IR systems A hash table relies on a hash function to map keys to their associated values Ina well designed table the cost of insertion and lookup requires constant amortized time and is independent of the number of entries in the table Such hash tables are commonly used for lookup duplicate detection searching and indexing in a wide range of domains including information retrieval A counting hash table is one in which in addition to the value associated with a key a reference count is also kept up to date in order to keep track of the occurrences of a speci“c key-value pair Counting hash tables are utilized directly or as a preprocessing step phase of Latent Semantic Indexing Probabilistic latent semantic analysis association mining[24 and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency TF-IDF  In the database conte xt such tables are used for indexing e.g XML indexing and selectivity As 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE 


a speci“c example consider TF-IDF a technique commonly used in text mining and information retrieval TF-IDF measures the importance of a particular word to a document given a corpus of documents by tracking the frequency of keywords This technique can be used for query processing document ranking and document similarity Supporting hash tables are an enormous challenge for the ash drive because they are naturally based on random hash functions and exhibit poor access locality In the IR context one often requires frequent in-place updates to the counts within individual records leading to further complications Such updates can be expensive unless they can be carefully batched with the use of specialized update techniques This paper will provide an effective method for updates to the tables in ash memory by using a carefully designed scheme which uses two closely related hash functions in order to ensure locality of the update operations This paper is organized as follows The remainder of this section will discuss the properties of the ash drive which are relevant to the effective design of the hash table We will then discuss related work and the contributions of this paper In Section II  we will discuss our different techniques Section III contains the experimental results The conclusions and summary are contained in Section IV  A Properties of the Flash Drive The solid state drive SSD is implemented with the use of Flash memory The most basic unit of access is a page which contains between 512 and 4096 bytes depending upon the manufacturer Furthermore pages are organized into blocks each of which may contain between 32 and 128 pages The data is read and written at the level of a page with the additional constraint that when any portion of data is overwritten at a given block the entire block must be copied to memory erased on the ash and then copied back to the ash after modi“cation Moreover ash drives can only support a limited number of erasures between 10,000 and 100,000 erasures after which the blocks may degrade and they may not be able to support further writes Management of the ash device blocks is performed automatically by the software known as the Flash Translation Layer FTL on the ash drive Thus even a small random update of a single byte could lead to an erase-write of the entire block Similarly an erase or clean can only be performed at the block level rather than the byte level Since random writes will eventually require erases once the ash device is full it implies that such writes will require block level operations On the other hand sequential writes on the ash are quite fast typically sequential writes are two orders of magnitude faster than random writes B Related Work Rosenblum and Ousterhout proposed the notion of logstructured disk storage management and mechanisms similar to log-structured le systems are adopted in modern SSDs either at the level of FTL or at the level of le system to handle issues related to wear-leveling and erase-before-write 15  18 28 As we discuss later  some of our b u f fering strategies are also inspired from log-structured le systems There have been hash tables designed with SSDs including the work presented in 4 9 29 10 Our designs dif fer from previous work because they are optimized for counting hash tables and our primary hash table is completely resident on the SSD other designs store the primary hash table on an HDD and utilize the SSD as a cache C Contributions of this paper In this paper we design a counting hash table for SSDs that maintains frequencies using a combination of memory and disk buffering schemes To our knowledge this has not been addressed thus far In this work we make the following speci“c contributions   i  We propose a mechanism to support large counting hash tables on SSDs via a two-level hash function which ensures that the random update property of ash devices is effectively handled by localizing the updates to SSD  ii  We devise a novel combination of memoryand diskbased buffering scheme that effectively addresses the problems posed by SSDs random writes write endurance While the memoryresident buffer leverages the fast random accesses to RAM the disk-resident buffer exploits fast read performance and fast sequential/semi-random write performance of SSDs  iii  We perform a detailed empirical evaluation to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by demonstrating the traditional IR algorithm TF-IDF using our hash table II A F LASH F RIENDLY H ASH T ABLE The major property of a hash table is that its effectiveness is highly dependent upon updates which are distributed randomly across the table On the other hand in the context of a ash-device it is precisely this randomness which causes random access to different blocks of the SSD Furthermore updates which are distributed randomly over the hash table are extremely degrading in terms of the wear properties of the underlying disk This makes hashing particularly challenging for the case of ash devices Hash table addressing is of two types open and closed  depending upon how the data is organized and collisions are resolved These two kinds of tables are as follows i Open Hash Table In an open hash table each slot of the hash table corresponds to multiple data entries Each entry of the collection is a key-frequency pair ii Closed Hash Table Each slot contains a single key-frequency pair However since multiple pairs cannot be mapped onto the same entry we need a collision resolution process i.e when a hashed object maps onto an entry which has already been lled A common strategy is to use linear probing in which we cycle through successive entries of the hash table until we either nd an instance of the object itself and increase its frequency or we nd an empty slot in which we insert the new entry We note that a fraction of the hash table typically at least a quarter needs to to be empty in order to ensure that the probing process is not a bottleneck The fraction of hash table which is full is denoted by the load factor f  It can be shown that 1  1  f  entries of the hash table are accessed on the average in order to access or update an entry In this paper we will use a combination of the open and closed hash tables in order to design our update structure We will use a closed hash table as the primary hash table which is stored on the Solid State drive along with a secondary hash table which is open and available in main memory We 8 


assume that the primary hash table contains q entries where q is dictated by the maximum capacity planned for the hash table for the application at hand The secondary hash table contains  q/r  entries where r<<q  The hash function for the primary and secondary hash tables are denoted by g  x  and s  x   and are de“ned as follows g  x   a  x  b  mod  q  1 s  x  a  x  b  mod  q  div  r  2 In general the scheme will work with any pair of hash functions g  x  and s  x  which satisfy the following relationship s  x  g  x  div  r  3 It is easy to see that the entries which are pointed to by a single slot of the memory-resident table are located approximately contiguously on the drive-resident closed table because of the way in which the linear probing process works This is an important observation and will be used at several places in ensuring the ef“ciency of the approach Linear probing essentially assumes that items that collide onto the same hash function value will be contiguously located in a hash table with no empty slots between them  Speci“cally the m th slot on the secondary table corresponds to entries starting from r   m  1 up to entry r  m in the primary table We note that most entries which would be pointed to by the m th slot of the secondary table would also map onto the afore-mentioned entries in the primary table though this would not always be true because of the over”ow behavior of the linear probing process beyond these boundaries A Desirable Update Properties of an SSD-based Hash-Table A naive implementation of a hash table will immediately issue update requests to the hash table as the data points are received The vast majority of the write operations will be random page level writes due to the lack of locality which is inherent in hash function design As mentioned before the cost of such operations will also increase the cost of cleans and random writes A desirable property for a hash table would be block-level updates and semi-random writes  The blocklevel update refers to the case when there are multiple updates written to a block and they are all accomplished at one time If there are k updates written to a block we should combine them into one block-level write operation This can reduce the number of cleans from k to one The semi-random writes refer to the fact that the updates to a particular block are in the same order as they are arranged on the block even though updates to different blocks may be interleaved with one another B Hash table designs Recall that we combine an open hash table in main memory with a closed-hash table on the SSD This open or secondary hash table is typically implemented in the form of a RAM buffer denoted as H R  The RAM buffer will contain updates for each block of the SSD and execute batch updates to the primary hash table on disk or data segment denoted by H D  at the block level This approach can reduce block level cleaning operations C Memory Bounded Buffering The overall structure of the common characteristics of the hash table architectures presented in this paper is illustrated in Figure 1 We refer to this scheme as Memory Bounded Buffering or MB  The RAM buffer H R  in the diagram is an open or secondary hash table and the data segment is a closed or primary hash table There are s slots each of which corresponds to a block in the data segment The maximum capacity of the data segment is q pages r pages per block and g entries per page Thus the number of slots in the secondary hash table s  must be equal to q/r  Updates are ushed onto the SSD one block at a time Because of the relationships between the hash functions of the primary and secondary table the merge process of a given list requires access to only a particular set of SSD blocks which can be maintained in main memory during the merging process D Memory and Disk Bounded Buffering Since H R is main-memory resident it is typically restricted in size Therefore a second buffer can be implemented on the SSD itself This new segment is referred to as the change segment or S E  The change segment acts as a second level buffer When H R exceeds its size limitations the contents are sequentially written to the change segment at the page level starting from the rst available page in an operation known as staging  When full the change segment merges with the data segment and begins from the top of the change segment A page in the change segment may contain updates from multiple blocks because pages are packed with up to g entries irrespective of their slot origin Thus the change segment is organized as a log structure that contains the ushed updates of the RAM buffer This takes advantage of the semi-sequential write performance of the SSD and increases the lifetime of the SSD The space allocated to the change segment is in addition to the space allocated to the data segment This hash table with change-segment included is illustrated in Figure 2 It is important to note that a stage operation differs from a merge operation in two ways speci“cally stages write at the page level while merges operate at the block level Furthermore stages involve updates to the change segment while merges involve updates to the data segment There are two types of architectures for the change segment In the rst design the change segment S E is viewed as a collection of blocks where each block holds updates from multiple lists from H R  In other words multiple blocks in the data segment are mapped to a single block in the change segment We arrange the change segment in a way such that each change segment block holds the updates for k data segment blocks The value of k is constant for a particular instantiation of the hash-table and can be determined in an application-speci“c way For an update-intensive application it is advisable to set k to a smaller value at the expense of SSD space When a particular change segment block is full we merge the information in the change segment to the data segment blocks By adding the change segment we are providing a more ef“cient buffering mechanism Staging a segment is more ef“cient than merging it because the change segment is written onto the SSD with a straightforward sequential write which is known to be ef“cient for the SSD This approach is called Memory Disk Buffering or MDB  In this variation of the 9 


MDB scheme which we henceforth will refer to as MDB-L for MDB-Linear  the space allocated for the change segment is viewed as a single large monolithic chunk of memory without any subdivisions This view resembles a large log le Thus the change segment blocks are not assigned to k data segment blocks The writes to the change segment are executed in FCFS fashion This type of structure mimics a log-structured le system and fully takes advantage of the SSD strength in sequential writes We maintain a collection of pointers to identify the ranges measured in pages that a particular slot in the RAM buffer has been staged These pointers are similar to the indexing information maintained in log-structured le systems that helps in reading the les from the log ef“ciently A merge operation is triggered when the change segment is full The collection of pointers can be used to identify the pages a particular block was staged to This process produces random reads on the change segment because the ranges span multiple stage points During a merge each page will be requested by each data segment block that has entries staged onto it After all of the pages for a particular data segment block are read from the change segment the entries are merged with the corresponding data segment block            Fig 1 Hash Table with RAM buffer            Fig 2 Hash Table with RAM buffer and Change Segment E Element Insertion and Update Process The element insertion process is designed to perform individual updates on the memory-resident table only since this can be done in an ef“cient way Such changes are later rolled on to the RAM buffer which is in turn rolled on to the change segment for some of the schemes An update or insertion in the TF-IDF context corresponds to increasing the occurrence count for a term For each incoming record x we rst apply the hash function s  x  in order to determine the slot to which the corresponding entry belongs We then determine if the key x is present inside the corresponding slot s  x   If the element is found then we increase its frequency The second case is when the key x is not contained inside the buffer which is pointed to by the slot s  x   In such a case we add the key x as a new element to the H R  The size of the H R increases in this case If H R has grown too large it is ushed either directly onto the change segment or the SSD itself depending upon whether or not the change segment is implemented in the corresponding scheme Because of the relationship between the hash functions of H R and the SSD based hash table such an update process tends to preserve the locality of the update process and if desired can also be made to preserve semirandom write properties During the insertion process of new items linear probing may occur because H D is a closed hash table If the linear probing process reaches the end of the current SSD block then we do not move the probe onto the next block Rather an over”ow region is allocated within the SSD table which takes care of probing over”ows beyond block boundaries The last index of the last page of an SSD block is a pointer referring to the over”ow region The entry that was resident at this position now resides in the con”ict region alongside the newly inserted entry Thus the data segment is a collection of blocks with logical extensions The over”ow region a collection of SSD blocks is allocated when the hash table is created and its size is a user parameter If an item is deleted from the data segment it can either be removed or its frequency can be set to zero This feature is handled during the merge operation Deleted items are ignored and removed during the rewriting of the data segment block F Query Processing In the context of TF-IDF a query can be thought of as a request for a words occurrence count In the simple hash table queries are ful“lled by an I/O request to the data segment However in our proposed designs the corresponding entry may be found either in the change segment or the RAM buffer Therefore the query processing approach must search the change segment and the RAM buffer in addition to the data segment Thus the frequency of a queried item is the total frequency found in the change segment RAM buffer and data segment The search of the RAM buffer may be inexpensive because it is in main memory On the other hand access to the change segment requires access to the SSD For the case of the data segment the query processing approach is quite similar to that of standard hash tables A hash function is applied to the queried entry in order to determine its page level location inside of the data segment If the entry is found the frequency is returned If the item is not found linear probing begins because the disk hash table is a closed hash Linear probing halts if the entry is found or an empty entry was discovered The query processing of the change segment requires locating the entry The location of the entry may reside in multiple segments due to repeated ushing of the RAM buffer Recall that MDB partitions the change segment When a RAM bucket is staged it is always written to the same change segment block We locate the appropriate change segment block and bring it into memory to be searched In MDB-L  RAM buckets can reside on multiple pages and thus we must issue random page reads We expect MDB-L to be faster because of page level access 10 


III E XPERIMENTS In this section we present an empirical analysis of the hash table designs discussed in the previous sections We evaluate the performance of the three main schemes discussed in this article namely MB  MDB and MDB-L  Broadly our objectives are to understand the I/O overheads of various schemes and their query performance while executing TF-IDF Additionally since SSD disks permit a limited number of clean operations it is also important to quantify the wear rate of the devices We begin with a discussion of the experimental setup A Experimental Setup To evaluate our hash table con“gurations we used the DiskSim simulation environment managed by Carne gie Mellon University and the SSD Extension for this environment created by Microsoft Research W e operated Disksim in slave mode Slave mode allows programmers to incorporate Disksim into another program for increased timing accuracy In a simulated environment as opposed to using a true SSD we are able to quantify the number of clean operations and the exact I/O cost of our methods executing TF-IDF We conducted our experiments on three different con“gurations of the latest representative NAND ash SSDs from Intel see Table I for details Among these two SSDs are MLC Multi-Level Cell and the other is SLC Single-Level Cell based SSDs We have chosen from both MLC and SLC because of their differing characteristics While MLC provides much higher data density and lower cost which makes it more popular it has a shorter lifespan and slow read/write performances SLC on the other hand has faster read/write performances and a signi“cantly longer lifespan SLCs also entail lower internal error rate making them preferable for higher performance high-reliability devices All hash table experiments involve inserting deleting and updating key value pairs The size of the RAM buffer is parameterized on the size of the data segment and expressed as a percentage The rationale here is that we believe that an end application may need to create multiple hash tables on the same SSD Moreover the characteristics of access may vary across applications i.e one may want different RAM buffer sizes for each hash table The change segment is likewise parameterized and the over”ow segment for all experiments was set to a minimal value one block since this was found to be suf“cient Keyvalue pairs are integer pairs We conducted our experiments on a DELL Precision T1500 with an Intel R  Core TM i7 CPU 860@2.8GHz with 8GBs of memory running Ubuntu 10.04 Our code was implemented in C The H R data structure utilized the C Standard Template Library for its implementation The RAM buffer buckets that correspond to data segment blocks are arranged inside a C vector and their indexes correspond to their placement on the data segment For example the rst block inside the data segment corresponds to the rst block in the RAM buffer The data segment can be viewed as an array logically divided into blocks and further divided into pages B TF-IDF To demonstrate the ef“cacy of our methods we implemented the TF-IDF algorithm see Section I  using our hash  SSD Con“gurations MLC-1 MLC-2 SLC Capacity 40GB

MemeTracker dump which are essentially large text les Wiki The rst data set we use is a collection of randomly collected Wikipedia articles We chose 100  000 random wikipedia articles collected from Wikipedias publicly available dump 1  Our 100  000 random articles were approximately 1 GB in size This dataset contains 136  749  203 tokens keywords with 9  773  143 unique entries For the testing of this data set our hash table was set to 100 MB Ona 128 page per block SSD this amounts to approximately 205 SSD blocks allocated to the data segment To evaluate I/O performance during inserts or updates 2 we simply insert or update tokens corresponding counts into the hash table Statistics and times for various operations cleans merges stages etc are computed and discussed shortly To evaluate query performance we rst processed 35 million tokens Subsequently roughly 100 million words were inserted Simultaneously with inserts we also issued a million queries interleaved randomly across inserts A query is a hash table lookup In the TF-IDF context this corresponds to how frequent is a keyword which allows us to compute the TF-IDF score of a keyword Of these queried items on average spread across 10 different random workloads 933  139 of them were present inside the hash table at query time Meme The second data set we report is the MemeTracker dataset discussed in Section 1  We downloaded the August 2008 dataset We found 17  005  975 unique entries and 402  005  270 total entries Since this dataset is slightly larger our hash table size was 200 MB Ona 128 page per block SSD this translates to approximately 410 SSD blocks allocated to the data segment I/O performance is evaluated by inserting or updating tokens just as with the Wiki dataset For query performance the rst 130 million words were inserted into the hash table Subsequently the remaining 270 million words were interleaved with about one million queries Of these queried items spread across 10 random workloads 959  731 of them were found inside the hash table 1 See http://dumps.wikimedia.org 2 As noted earlier deletes are handled as inserts with a negative count 11

D Query Time Performance In each graph the Y-axis is the average time per query in milliseconds Results on both Wiki and Meme are provided in Figure 3 The main trends we observe include i the query time for MB are quite low does not have a change segment ii the query time for MDB is quite high and does not drop signi“cantly with reduction in change segment size iii the query time for MDB-L improves dramatically with a reduction in the change segment size and iv query times for Meme are marginally lower than the query times for Wiki for both MDB and MDB-L  These trends can be explained as follows Query costs for MB are essentially xed since they essentially have to combine the counts from the memory buffer negligible and require typically a page read to access the requisite information from the data segment Query costs for MDB require consolidation of information from the memory buffer negligible and from the change segment expensive  dominated by block level reads and the data segment usually a single page read Query costs for MDB-L require consolidation across the memory buffer negligible the change segment typically requiring a few page reads which are signi“cantly reduced as the size of the change segment is reduced and the data segment usually a single page read This is re”ected in our rst experiment shown in Figure 3\(a for MLC-1 in which we varied the change segment while xing the RAM buffer to 5 With regards to the difference between Wiki and Meme query times upon drilling down into the data we nd that on average there are 11.5 more page reads for Wiki This may be an artifact of the linear probing costs within both datasets given the fact that the ratio of number of unique tokens to hash table size is slightly higher for Wiki For the second experiment again on the MLC-1 con“guration we xed the change segment to 12.5 and varied the the RAM buffer for both datasets\(see Figure 3\(b We observe that with an increase in RAM buffer size that  i MB shows a negligible change in average query time ii MDB shows decrease in average query time iii MDB-L shows a signi“cant decrease in average query time performance and iv query times on Meme are typically faster than those on Wiki To explain these trends we should rst note that increasing RAM buffer size has the general effect of reducing the number of stage operations and thus the average size of the amount of useful information within the change segment Thus the time it takes to consolidate the information within the change segment in order to answer the query is on average lower for both MDB and MDB-L For MDB-L the improvement is more marked because fewer page reads are required The explanation for why query times are lower for Meme are similar to what we observed for the previous experiment The third experiment we performed on query time performance was to evaluate the performance of the three SSD con“gurations on the Wiki dataset shown in Figure 3\(c Here the RAM buffer was set to 5 and the Change Segment was set to 12.5 The results are along expected lines in that average query times are slightly better on MLC-2 and SLC over MLC1 for the MDB method The superior read performance for both page level and block level operations are the primary reason This difference is marked in the case of MDB but for both MDB-L and MB the difference is negligible MDB requires a block level read for a query and the performance difference for this type of operation is more pronounced for MLC-2 and SLC over when compared with MLC-1 To conclude we should reiterate that the query performance times we observe here are for our update-intensive query workload where we interleaved queries with inserts averaged over multiple runs In this environment the query time performance of MB is always the fastest For reasonable parametric settings MDB-L typically approaches MB in performance while MDB is always an order of magnitude worse in terms of performance We should note that we also evaluated query times for all three methods in more stable settings few updates/inserts In such a stable setting we found that the query times for all three methods was identical  The query cost essentially boils down to a page read or two on the data segment since the change segment is empty and does not factor Furthermore MDB is bounded by a single block read while the query time of MDB-L may vary However as our results indicate the pointer guided page level accesses of MDB-L provide ef“cient read access that outperforms MDB E I/O Performance In this section we examine the I/O performance of the three strategies To ignore the impact of queries in this section our workloads for both datasets simply insert all the tokens or words into their respective hash tables In our rst experiment we report overall I/O cost from the perspective of the SSD for the three SSD con“gurations for both Wiki see Figure 4\(a and Meme see Figure 4\(b The RAM buffer is set to 5 and the change segment is set to 12.5 in this experiment The main trend we observe are that both MDB-L and MDB require comparable yet signi“cantly lower I/O costs than MB  This is primarily attributable to the presence of the change segment which enables sequential MDB-L or semirandom writes MDB  We trade block level operations for page level operations In our analysis of block and page level operations MDB-L had more page level operations and fewer block level operations than MDB due to the linear change segment This gives MDB-L an edge of over MDB  in our deeper analysis we veri“ed some of the intuitive ideas of our designs as we increase the size of the change segment we decrease the number of block level merge operations and as we increase the RAM buffer we reduce the number of stage operations Additionally as we shall see shortly MB requires a large number of erasures which also contribute to the overall I/O cost Another trend we observe is that among the SSD con“gurations SLC and MLC-2 offer comparable performance with a slight edge to SLC MLC-1 is quite a bit slower This is primarily attributable to the superior write bandwidth of SLC and MLC-2 Finally we observe that the overall I/O times are higher for Meme over Wiki larger dataset and larger hash table Not shown in our reports are the performance measures for a hash table without the use of a buffer The advantage of this scheme is fast query times because queries are only page level reads on the data segment However results show that such a hash table would induce 1,680,323 cleans for the Wiki dataset and 6,669,932 cleans for the Meme dataset The I/O performance are on the order of 615 times slower on the Wiki dataset and 1500 times slower for the Meme dataset for reported times for the results in Figure 4 This increase is caused by cleaning time and random page writes It is clear that there is a bene“t from our designs Summing up the I/O performance it is fair to say 13 


that for most reasonable parameter settings MDB and MDBL signi“cantly outperform MB in terms of the cost of I/O from the perspective of the ash device Additionally it should be noted that the merging operation within both MDB and MDB-L will happen completely within the SSD allowing for an overlap of CPU operations  not re”ected in any of the experiments whereas a merge for MB and staging for the other two methods will require some CPU intervention Also note that an MB merge operation is signi“cantly more expensive than an MDB or MDB-L stage operation random writes versus semi-random/sequential writes F Cleans In our next experiment we take a closer look at the number of clean operations required by these methods for both datasets see Figure 5 Our graphs display the variation of RAM buffer size for both datasets and the variation of change segment size for the Wiki dataset along the Wiki dataset for the X-axis The Y-axis is the amount of erasures The main trends and explanations for these trends are i the number of cleans goes down with increasing RAM buffer sizes since there are fewer stages and merges as shown in Figure 5\(a ii the number of cleans is signi“cantly higher for MB compared to that of the other two methods because the change segment provides an extra level of buffering for MDB and MDB-L as shown in Figure 5\(b iii the number of cleans increases for MDB and MDB-L as we decrease the size of the change segment because the change segment lls more often and thus there are more merges MB does not use the change segment so it stays a constant value and iv the number of cleans for MDB and MDB-L are very similar with MDB-L being slightly better The reduction for MDB-L is clearly attributable to the linear change segment design IV C ONCLUSIONS Hash tables pose a challenge for SSDs because of their random write access patterns Traditional IR algorithms such as TF-IDF rely on hash tables and may suffer under a poor hash table design TF-IDF requires extensive updating of term frequencies Updating an entry inside of a disk hash table may trigger an entire erasure of an SSD block Repeatedly updating a hash table can be detrimental to the limited lifetime of the underlying SSD A simple hash table without buffering can be implemented It has superior query time but it induces a substantial amount of cleans and I/O cost From our experiments we believe that an SSD friendly hash table will have a RAM buffer and a disk based buffer that supports semi-random writes These features will increase the locality of updates and reduce the I/O cost of the hash table for both low and high end SSDs Overall our results reveal that when one accounts for both I/O performance and query performance MDB-L seems to offer the best of both worlds on the workloads we evaluated for reasonable parameter settings of change segment size and RAM buffer size Using MDB-L we observe 1500 times speedup in execution time and over 6 million fewer erasures when compared to a naive implementation In the future we would also like to extend our design to hash functions that do not rely on the mod operator e.g extendible hashing and examine

     Fig 12 Results comparison Planned routes top left Passenger ow comparison of two segments at different frequency top right Opened nightbus routes bottom left Number of delivered passengers at different frequency  R 1 vs R 2  bottom right is motivated by the needs of applying pervasive sensing communication and computing technology for sustainable city development To solve the problem we propose a two-phase approach for night-bus route planning In the rst phase we devise method to identify locations of the candidate bus stops with the passenger pick-ups and drop-offs as inputs In the second phase with the bus route origin destination and candidate bus stops as inputs we develop two heuristic algorithms to automatically generate candidate bus routes and nally we select the best route which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions On a real-world dataset which contains more than 1.57 million passenger delivery trips we compare our proposed candidate bus stop identi“cation method with the popular k means clustering method and show that our method can generate more reasonable and meaningful results We further extensively evaluate our proposed probability based spreading algorithm for automatic bus route generation and validate its effectiveness as well as its superior performance over the heuristic topk spreading algorithm Further more we show the selected night-bus route with our proposed approach is better than a newly started night-bus route-in-service in Hangzhou China This work is among our initial attempts to apply pervasive computing techniques in achieving better urban planning of smart cities With the constraints of the approach and the acquired data this work still has several limitations 1 Human mobility patterns uncovered by taxi GPS traces are biased and incomplete thus the designed bus route might not be the best considering the fact that taxi traf“c does not re”ect the whole passenger ow and people taking taxis might not be willing to switch to public transport for various reasons 2 The work makes some assumptions in problem formulation and evaluation for example for bus stop determination we set the walkable distance as 500 meters and the threshold for cluster split and merge is 150 meters apparently the choice of those parameters would affect the results but a study of the parameter sensitivity is not provided due to the space limitation 3 Currently we only explore the issue of designing the best bus route for a given OD pair the proposed approach is still unable to tackle the design of a bus route network In the future we plan to broaden and deepen this work in several directions First we attempt to investigate the optimal bus route design with more real-life assumptions such as varied bus operation frequency and limited bus capacity Second we plan to study the impact of parameter change on the bus route design and the added bus route on the taxi services along the bus route Third we would like to develop practical systems leveraging on taxi GPS traces enabling a series of pervasive smart transportation services A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the shepherd Dr

15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
