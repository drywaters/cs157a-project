REFERENCES  6 I INTRODUCTION In order to perform 3-dimensional analyses of space radiation shielding requirements for future missions in deep space the Monte Carlo radiation transport code HETC has been extended to include transport of energetic heavy ions such as are found in the galactic cosmic ray spectrum in space To carry out this extension a heavy ion collision event generator capable of providing the necessary nuclear interaction data for use in HETC has 
been developed and incorporated into the transport code The event generator predicts the interaction product yields production angles and energies using nuclear models and Monte Carlo techniques Testing modification and validation of the event generator and extended transport code now called HETC-HEDS High Energy Transport Code Human Exploration and Development of Space is being carried out 1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 
C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1151 Version 5 Updated December 17 2007 One of the 
main difficulties one faces when comparing experimental data with simulations is incorporating all the corrections made to the experimental data The corrections might include such things as the actual beam energy on the target the momentum or energy spread in the incident beam the actual dimensions thicknesses and compositions of the components in the experimental beam geometry and the efficiencies and percentage of dead layers in the detectors Unfortunately at times some of these experimental quantities are unknown and this lack of 
knowledge can significantly affect comparisons between the simulations and the experiments The effects of some of these will be demonstrated in this paper clearly indicating that they must be taken into account The purpose of this paper is to compare the simulation results with experimental results in order to validate HETC-HEDS and show that even if a very minor correction is not taken into account when simulating an experiment the results can vary greatly II HIGH-ENERGY IRON BEAM EXPERIMENTS The experimental 
data used here were obtained by researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory LBNL using beams from the E898 experiment at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron AGS at Brookhaven National Laboratory BNL 1 A silicon detector telescope four elements of which were placed upstream of the target was used to identify charged particles Two trigger detectors TRI and TR2 each about 330 pm thick with an active area of 300 mm2 were placed furthest upstream and were used to 
trigger the experiment A pair of position-sensitive silicon detectors PSD1X and PSD1Y was placed downstream of the trigger detectors to provide vertical and horizontal position information Each PSD detector is 1Imm thick Targets were placed downstream of the PSD detectors The beam energy at the target entrance was determined to be 1.053\261 005GeV/nucleon A second pair of detectors PSD2X and PSD2Y was placed 30 cm further downstream A second pair of 3mm thick 1 


silicon detectors was placed 22 cm downstream of the targets with an active area of 300 mm2 Each PSD generates two position-dependent signals and a third signal proportional to the total charge liberated in the detector Two methods were used to determine the beam energy at the exit of the vacuum line to be 1.064 2610.005GeV/nucleon Both methods yielded highly consistent results and the decrease in energy to the quoted 1.053 261 0.005GeV/nucleon at the target entrance is due to ionization energy loss in the silicon detectors TRI TR2 PSD1Y and PSD1X respectively The large experimental acceptance is defined by PSD2X and the small experimental acceptance is defined by the two 3mm silicon detectors Additional detectors were used in the experiment but will not be described here due to their irrelevance to our comparisons The detector configuration for this experiment is shown schematically in Figure 1 Figure 1 Target and detector geometry for the 56Fe beam atBNL Data acquisition was initiated by an event trigger and for each event the data acquisition system recorded energy deposition in each detector position information from PSD 1 and PSD2 and additional high gain energy deposition signals from the detectors downstream 3mm 1 2 2 Several target materials were used in the experiment but we have only included sample results for two materials of interest 3.99 g/cm2 carbon and 9.35 g/cm2 polyethylene III HETC-HEDS HETC-HEDS simulates particle cascades by using Monte Carlo methods to compute the trajectories of the primary particle and all the secondary particles produced in nuclear collisions 3 The particles considered by HETC-HEDS protons neutrons 2  2 g or t light ions and heavy ions can be arbitrarily distributed in angle energy and space Each particle in the cascade is followed until it disappears by escaping from the boundaries of the system undergoes a nuclear collision or absorption comes to rest due to energy losses from ionization and excitation of atomic electrons in the target medium or in the case of pions and muons decays Neutrons produced below a specified cutoff usually 20 MeV and photons produced in the cascade from 210 decays or from deexcitation are not transported Information regarding the neutrons and photons is stored for transport by other codes such as MORSE 4 MCNP 5 and EGS 6 HETC-HEDS provides a complete history file of all cascades so that analyses of specific problems can be performed The energy losses of protons light and heavy ions charged pions and muons due to the excitation and ionization of target atomic electrons are treated using the Bethe-Bloch stopping power formula 7 based on the continuous slowing-down approximation Range straggling is taken into account Range-energy tables for each material in the system are computed for protons These same tables are used for nuclei with mass numbers A  1 and for charged pions and muons by making use of scaling relations HETCHEDS currently allows multiple Coulomb scattering only for the primary charged particles Pion production is based on the isobar model of Stemheimer and Lindenbaum 8 Only singleand doublepion production in nucleon-hydrogen collisions and singlepion production in pion-nucleon collisions are accounted for This model is used for energies up to 3.5 GeV for neutrons and protons and up to 2.5 GeV for charged pions Nonelastic nucleon collisions and charged-pion collisions with hydrogen nuclei at energies above 3.5 GeV and 2.5 GeV respectively are treated by using the calculational methods of Ref 9 Special provisions are made to insure that energy and nucleons are conserved for each collision Efforts are underway but not yet completed to incorporate pion production channels for collisions involving light and heavy ions Charged-pion decay is taken into account using the known pion lifetime The neutrino produced in the decay is ignored The neutral pion is assumed to decay into two photons at its point of origin HETC-HEDS does not transport neutral pions However the energy direction and spatial location of the neutral pions produced are included as part of the output Muon decay in flight is taken into account using the known muon lifetime Muons that come to rest are assumed to decay immediately No information about the electrons positrons or neutrinos produced from muon decay is calculated Elastic collisions of protons and pions with all nuclei other than hydrogen are neglected at all energies Elastic collisions of light and heavy ions with target nuclei are treated using cross sections obtained from an optical potential model derived from quantum multiple scattering theory The angular dependence is obtained using a Fraunhofer approximation Details are provided in Ref 10 2 


PSD detectors m 4 30 one material to the other We accounted for the differences by normalizing the results obtained with HETC-HEDS to the number of particles used in experiment HETC-HEDS was compiled using was run on a desktop system running Ubuntu 6.06 LTS The simulations with 105 cm 22 Elastic collisions by neutrons with nuclei other than hydrogen at energies above the neutron cutoff energy usually 20 MeV is optional and if the option is chosen requires the input of elastic scattering cross section data R and do,/dQ The intranuclear-cascade evaporation concept of particlenucleus interaction as modeled by Bertini 11 is used to model the particle-nucleus collisions below 3.5 GeV for nucleons and below 2.5 GeV for charged pions Following the intranuclear-cascade the residual excitation energy is treated using an evaporation model 12 The particles allowed to evaporate are protons neutrons d 3H 3He and oc An extrapolation model determines the energy angle and multiplicity of the products from inelastic nucleonnucleus and pion-nucleus collisions at higher energies 3-15 GeV 13 Heavy ion interactions are modeled using the new event generator described in the next section In this event generator nucleus-nucleus collision total cross sections are based upon an optical potential approximation of a nucleusnucleus multiple scattering formalism 14 15 Nucleusnucleus reaction cross sections are described using the parameterization due to Tripathi 16 Breakup of light ions Z  2 is divided into 3 pieces which are 1 deuteron breakup 2 alpha fragmentation and 3 3H and 3He breakup These are described in detail in the next section and in Ref 17 Finally breakup of heavy ions Z  2 is described using the semiempirical fragmentation model NUCFRG2 developed at NASA Langley Research Center 18 IV CALCULATION SETUP In these simulations we have tracked the primary particles produced as well source particles per simulation runs with the experiment varied from a g77-3.4.6 compiler and source particles typically took about thirty minutes to run which is over many three dimensional Monte Carlo transport codes that on target of 1.053 GeV/nucleon for each of the runs which corresponds to the experimental setup We have also ignored the detectors downstream the small acceptance detectors as they are beyond the detectors that we are interested in and not needed in our analysis We have included internal void air gaps in the simulation to account for the gaps between the telescope components Our simulation setup is depicted in figure 2 3mm cm air gap air gap Figure 2 Target and detector geometry for the 56Fe beam using HETC-HEDS The major correction we made was to include the dead layer percentage for each of the silicon detectors We have run several simulations where a combination of corrections was made to try and pinpoint the differences between data and simulation We first used 1 GeV/nucleon energy and 1 mm thickness for each of the PSD detectors which resulted in a significant difference when compared with experiment We then tried to correct for either the beam energy or the detectors thickness The results of our comparisons are described in the results section V DISCUSSION OF RESULTS In this work we have included comparisons of the energy deposited and particle fluence yields In order to have valid results we have included a number of trials to try to minimize the differences in the comparisons Since the actual corrections needed to be accounted for were unknown we carried out a combination of corrections where we either changed the energy the detector thicknesses or both These corrections included degrading the beam energy to a range between 0.95-0.99 GeV/nucleon and using a 1 mm thickness for each of the large acceptance detectors 1 mm PSD2 we then increased the beam energy to a range between 1.01-1.05 GeV and we used a 1 mm thickness for the detectors Then we took into consideration the percent dead layer in the detectors Since we did not know what the percentage actually was we decreased the thickness of the detectors and used a single beam energy to account for this Once we got reasonable comparable results for the 1 mm detectors we then did the similar types of trials for the 3 mm detectors comparisons The only comparable result was the one where we did an identical correction as was done for the 1 mm thick detectors To show this process we will start with the 3 can take hours and sometimes thick Target an advantage even days to as every possible secondary fragment produced The paths of 105 same number of simulations We have ignored the detectors upstream of the targets and used run the were followed through the test material while the number of beam particles a beam energy

6 Safety Properties There are a variety of different semantics and models for CSP processes We concentrate on the trace model and the failure model in this work In a trace model a process is represented by the sequences of communications or events it can perform In the stable failures model a process is represented by its failures A failure for a process P  is given by a pair  s X   where s is a trace of P and X is a set of things it can refuse to perform after performing s  We intend to provide some desired safety and liveness properties for the hospital AIDC system We will provide the speciìcations for a CSP process by providing the most nondeterministic process satisfying the speciìcation The CSP process for a hospital AIDC system satisìes a speciìcation S if the CSP process P representing the speciìcation is reìned by the AIDC system process We will consider two different types of reìnement trace reìnement for safety properties and failure reìnement for liveness properties  A process Q is a trace reìnement of another process P  denoted by P  T Q if traces  Q   traces  P   A process Q is a failure reìnement of another process P  denoted by P  F Q if failures  Q   F failures  P   If we have a process P and its safety speciìcation S and we have S  T P  then we can say P is a safe process as all its traces are traces of the speciìcation so no bad event can be performed by P  Similarly failure reìnement can be used to express liveness properties We now express the environment of a hospital AIDC system as the collection of all the identiìcation tags representing the devices and patients and the devices sending out the readings for patients together with the electronic records system These are the given components which we cannot control Given   d  Dev Dev  d     p  Pat Pat  p   BTDevs  EHR We shall refer to the combination of all instances of nurses and medical mediators as the system It is important that only one nurse have use a medical mediator at a time This is reîected in our speciìcation by allowing each medical mediator to choose a nurse System   m   n  Nurse  n m     y  x.y  HCI n m x    Med  n m     y  x.y  EHRCh m x    EHRInterface   y 012 nmpdx y   RFIDChan n p x  y   EHRBECh m x  y   BTAddr n,m d x  y   BTScan m x   System In the system we hide away almost all internal and interelement communication The only events that we are interested in are the actual scanning of patient and device identiìer tags and the ultimate sending of the medical measurement to the EHR for storage after it has been veriìed by the nurse We now provide the safety speciìcation for the hospital AIDC system where the speciìcation ensures that if a tuple of data is entered into a database stating that a particular device d was used to take a reading x from a patient p by a nurse n  then it had been the case that the nurse n did identify p and d and had taken a medical measurement x from the patient p using d after identifying them Safety   m   n  p  d  RFIDChan n,m p  IDnum  p     RFIDChan n,m d  IDnum  d      RFIDChan n,m d  IDnum  d     RFIDChan n,m p  IDnum  p      Skip   BTScan m  X   Skip   if BTAddr n,m d  X then  BTAddr n,m d  r   Skip  EHRBECh m   n m IDnum  p   IDnum  d  EHR  r   Skip  else Skip  Safety Now we are ready to specify the desired safety and liveness properties Let Vis   y   ndx.y  RFIDChan n,m d x     mz.y  EHRBECh m z    The properties then are as follows Safety    Vis    Given  T System    Vis    Given LIVE  F System    Vis    Given where LIVE   x x  LIVE  LIVE is the most nondeterministic process that is deadlock free The rst property states that no wrong random non-associated tuple gets stored in EHR and the second property states that the nurse can eventually take steps and will not get deadlocked We have sketched proofs for the above results based on their semantics using traces of events Due to the large number of cases to be considered we feel that such a proof is easily subject to accidental omissions and hence is best checked by automated assistant To this end we have encoded the CSP processes described in this paper two such tools The rst system we used was the fully automated CSP failures-reìned prover FDR2 Failures-Divergence Reìnement Our e xperience with this system is limited but a straightforward encoding led the system to run for hours probably indicating divergence The second system we used was the extension CSP-prover to the interacti v e theorem pro v e r Isabelle In this system there is a restricted type system for communications and the encoding entailed creating a number of functions for coercing data into this type system Also certain operators were lacking Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


index interleaving in particular and so we had to expand the code to accommodate this lack As of this writing the proofs in CSP-prover of the above two results are incomplete We conclude from this effort that there are interesting challenges to automating proofs of AIDC workîows such as the ones for the mediator To summarize these results in less technical language there are three possibilities for the outcome of operator actions First there are actions that make progress by providing proper updates of the EHR This will occur when the nurse adheres to the speciìed workîow Second there are actions that lie within the protection envelope but do not make progress For example repeated reading of a patientês tag is tolerated by the system although it is not the speciìed workîow A detected error occurs when reading tags on two devices rather than on a patient and a device Third there are actions that corrupt the EHR database These require signiìcant deviation from speciìed workîow such as reading the tag on one patient and then collecting a reading from a different patient 7 Related Work We are not aware of any prior work on formal modeling and analysis of ADIC workîows in health care but formal techniques have been applied to workîows in general there have been case studies in heath care applications and there is a signiìcant body of non-formal work on AIDC in health care Yong et al in use CSP to model and reìne workîows to prove correctness properties Puhlmann et al  use the  calculus to model workîow patterns Stafansen sho ws ho w the Calculus of Communicating Systems CCS can be used to model workîow Davulcu et al  use Concurrent T ransaction Logic CTR to specify analyze and schedule workîows Van der Alast et al  use Petri nets to model w orkîo w  Petri nets are able to model Yet Another Workîow Language\(YAWL which in turn can model a wide range of workîow patterns Barkaoui et al  use Petri nets to model v erify and improve an operating room workîow Song et al 22 provide a classiìcation of computer-aided health care workîows and workîow application issues Van der Alast et al  describes a method for nding w orkîo ws as Petri nets automatically from hospital process logs Ardissono et al  present a frame w ork for the management of context-aware workîow systems They use the framework to develop a prototype application handling medical guidelines specifying workîow for monitoring patients treated with blood thinners In our research on AIDC we attempted to use  calculus and Finite State Machines FSMs before concluding that CSP was better-suited to our needs because of its algebraic notation simple treatment of communication and its representation for internal and external choice However it is likely other models discussed above could provide good formalisms for reasoning about AIDC AIDC techniques are now being used in many different areas in the health care sector One notable area is the use of AIDC techniques for the blood management to reduce blood handling errors so that the chances of bad blood transfusions is reduced Clarke et al 7 model and verify an in-patient blood transfusion process Al Nahas et al  o v ervie w research in v arious applications of RFID-based AIDC systems in hospitals Automated identiìcation of patients pro vides more accurate and efìcient association of patients with their medical readings and the medical procedures they should undergo AIDC techniques are being deployed to provide error-free and fully-audited drug management in hospitals 4 Hospital-wide AIDC 9 10 is being investigated for tracking patients assets and staff 8 Conclusion We have introduced a methodology for modeling and analyzing AIDC workîows to provide high assurance protection envelopes Such techniques will aid the development of computer and networking systems that support AIDC in safety-critical workîows like those used in hospitals To illustrate and demonstrate the value of our approach we have designed and implemented a medical mediator system which provides RFID identiìcation using a mobile device that links to medical devices to collect patient readings and enters them automatically in the EHR of the correct patient within wellspeciìed and veriìed conditions This is the rst work on formal analysis of AIDC workîows it contributes insight into good primitives for clear speciìcations in this area and promises wide applicability Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by NSF CNS 07-16626 NSF CNS 07-16421 NSF CNS 05-24695 ONR N00014-08-1-0248 NSF CNS 05-24516 DHS 2006-CS-001-000001 and grants from the MacAruthur Foundation and Boeing Corporation Anh Nguyen was supported by a fellowship from the Vietnam Education Foundation The views expressed are those of the authors only References  FDR2\(F ailures-Di v e r gence Reìnement internet website http://www.fsel.com  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10

  12 the PL is intended to fulfill, thus many requirements and specifications that would be found in a PL design specification would need to be provided by the specific PL procurement agency. The ORS Phase III standards can be downloaded from http://projects.nrl.navy.mil/busstandards  Communications Interfaces  A key external interface for th e space segment \(bus and PL is RF communications to the ground. This topic investigated standardization for SC command and control \(C&C communications link and the tactical communication link Figure 11 presents a basic high-level view of the RF communications pathways envisioned in the standards Other issues investigated related to both current and future approaches the military is planning for RF communications including, data flow, frequency band definitions modulation techniques, data rates, communication security COMSEC\and basic defi nition of ground interface locations. Given the current maturity of the general military SC C&C network, the presen t SGLS architecture and the expected Unified S-Band \(USB\architecture were established as the standard. Fo r the tactical links, standard UHF was established for LDR application, and the Common Data Link \(CDL\ocol was established as the HDR standard Ground Support Checkout Interface In support of the rapid call-up scenario, standards for interfacing spacecraft bus and the payload, and processing the integrated space vehicle though launch, is one of the unique activities under the IS ET derived ORS system design. The need to develop an approach for this effort in sufficient detail in order to derive requirements that would influence the spacecraft bus design is critical. The approaches developed have design and manufacturing ramification on the bus, such as the ability to install batteries late in the flow, rapid \223built-in-test\224 capabilities periodic checks, and access a nd safety implications Data Interfaces: Bus to Payload and Ground This document defines the data exchange protocols, data transport formats, packet definitions and field definitions for the bus/PL interface. Underlying electrical interface for the bus/PL interface is the HDLC and SpaceWire. The bus/PL interface is defined such that the HDLC interface SpaceWire interface, or both can be used. The bus design will provide support for both interfaces. The PL may choose to implement either one or both. The bus/PL interface is defined to dynamically suppor t either or both interfaces without needing bus reconfiguration \(i.e., FSW changes This document also defines the data exchange protocols data transport and packet template for the space/ground interface. The space to ground interface definition assumes the use of a flight side SGLS transponder integrated with COMSEC slices. The SGLS forward link assumes a flightside Cardholder COMSEC slice. The SGLS return link  Figure 11 Radio Frequency Communications Architecture  


  13 assumes that the SGLS transponder supports both the narrow-band and wide-band inte rfaces. While a return link COMSEC is required, this document assumes that the return link COMSEC does not levy any blocking or packaging constraints for the return link This interface standard was developed as part of the ORS Phase 3 Bus effort. This interface standard was adopted by the ORS Phase 3 Bus and COMMx payload elements. As a result, the TACSAT-4 spacecraft implemented the encl osed interface standards for its bus to payload and space to ground interfaces This document is limited to and currently defines the interfaces between the spacecraf t bus and the payload, and between the spacecraft bus and the ground. Subsequent releases will define the add itional internal interfaces. The depth of detail required for in terface standardization and the need for coverage of additional interfaces is an ongoing assessment effort by ORS s upported standards definition efforts. The intent is to levy interface standards where these standards will lead to efficien t system integration, robust operational capabilities, and improved system flexibility while reducing overall system cost 4  C ONCLUSION  Both the STP-SIV and the ORS ISET efforts have developed standards that provide options for cost-effective capable, flexible spaceflight. Pathfinder SC buses are currently in development for both efforts and will have flight heritage within approximately one year Through the efforts of ISET and the associate prototype teams, the ORS program ha s successfully produced an extensive and well-documented set of ORS bus standards consistent with the ORS concept of operations \(CONOPS and classes of missions. The process used to produce these standards has resulted in technically sound standards which are understood, with buy in from industry. Business factors were also strongly considered to improve the transition of these standards into successful acquisition under a subsequent operational phase While ORS must provide the business foundation, these technical standards are intended to be more broadly useful in order to further volume production, standards acceptance, and the industry business cases. The ORS standards are readily available to Government organizations and payload developers SDTW employs lessons learned from decades of space flight to standardization of STP-SIV design. Flexibility is planned from the beginning and missions are adapted within the range of the SC\222s capability. Development of SC standards requires upfront investment in order to achieve a return on investment once multiple missions have been built and flown. The more PL provi ders who are willing to adopt the STP-SIV interfaces and deve lop experiments applicable to the capabilities of the SC the more successful this program will become R EFERENCES   National Research Council The Role of Small Satellites in NASA and NOAA Earth Observation Programs National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 2000  G F Squibb, \223Meeting the Needs of the Space Technology Industry,\224 ISO Focus, Oct 2005   T.

Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.
