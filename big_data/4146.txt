large bandwidth availability allowing to propose many innovative services that need high-volume transfers Therefore the exploitation of W band is foreseen in order to meet the high-quality data transmission for a large number of end users and data-oriented services 1 The IKNOW mission is a demonstrative experiment foreseen within the phase A2 of the WAVE W band Analysis and VErification project a study funded by the Italian Space Agency ASI which aims at designing and developing 
W band payloads for telecommunication applications This paper will be focused on the characterization of the IKNOW mission within the WAVE project devoted to carry out a preliminary channel propagation assessment Specifically special attention will be paid to the payload design particularly critical from the technological point of view at these high frequencies The basic idea is to develop the receiving/transmitting chain using MMIC devices in order to fit cost power and weight constraints typically limited for 
a spacecraft Technological critical items will be highlighted focusing on the present state of the art and presenting some architectural choices Moreover some simulations based on ADS software will be reported in order to simulate the performance of the identified payload configuration 2 1

 7 REFERENCES  9 BIOGRAPHY  9 1 INTRODUCTION W band is an innovative frequency range covering the millimeter part of the electromagnetic spectrum 75-110 GHz respectively 4 2.7 mm In the last years an increasing interest for this range has been demonstrated in some fields due to its advantageous characteristics such as high bandwidth availability short wavelength 
reduced interference reduced antenna size So far main application which has demonstrated great interest in W band is the radar domain Actually the frequency range around 94-95 GHz is at present employed both for terrestrial and space applications Rheinmetall Italy ex Oerlikon Contraves Italy developed a W band operative radar 95 GHz devoted to monitor the airport surface traffic surveillance duties through high resolution imaging exploiting the short wavelength intrinsic to the new frequency Moreover 
recently 2006 3 NASA launched a new mission CloudSat to study clouds and climate using a weather W band radar 94 GHz it is the first space mission employing W band even if for radar applications Concerning telecommunication applications at present no operative mission has been developed but only feasibility studies Italy through the Italian Space Agency ASI is one of the first countries that have made an effort towards the exploitation of W band for telecommunications At 1 


present the more advanced studies have been carried out by ASI with DAVID DAta and Video Interactive Distribution devoted to pioneer the use of the W band channel for telecommunications purposes C/D phase proposal and later WAVE W band Analysis and VErification a feasibility study for designing a telecommunication payload to be deployed in geostationary orbit However main question around the use of W band for telecommunications is to understand the propagation channel behavior at present unknown and derivable only through the application of attenuation models validated at lower frequencies such as ITU models It is known that to increase the frequency from Ka to W affects more the signal through different effects attenuation depolarisation scintillations etc mainly due to rain gases absorption oxygen and water vapor and clouds but physical models of propagation do not exist at these high frequencies and especially experimental measurements to be used to validate these models are not available Any design of a space mission using W band for telecommunications needs to know the channel behavior in order to assign the suited margin in the link WAVE phase A has been carried out in 2004 to evaluate the feasibility of a W band telecommunications payload for a geostationary orbit mission in order to provide both an experimental study on the propagation in W band and a preliminary experimentation towards the commercial suitability of the channel for data relay services A second phase of WAVE called phase A2 started in March 2007 and currently on-going aims at carrying out at the same time two main research lines due to the complexity of the GEO mission The first research line is a demonstrative study concerning the development of an experimental payload on-board of a High Altitude Platform HAP referred to as Aero-WAVE as well as the development of a nano-satellite platform carrying a small W band payload referred to as IKNOW The second research line is a pre-operative study on the GEO-orbit outlined in the previous phase 4 and a payload in LEO-orbit on a dedicated micro-satellite platform 2 THE IKNOW MISSION The IKNOW mission is the second demonstrative mission and it is the obvious evolution of the Aero-WAVE mission HAP Demonstrator IKNOW payload will be used for a first uplink-downlink in-orbit validation of W band technology and space qualification processes This mission will be a first step towards future exploitation of W band its aim being to provide a first evaluation of the W band satellite channel in order to verify the feasibility of more complex missions and the possibility of an operational use of W band satellite telecommunications Hereafter some results about IKNOW demonstrator of the currently ongoing WAVE phase A2 have been reported The activities within the on-going IKNOW program focus on the development of a payload carried on-board a dedicated platform to be inserted into a LEO orbit with the aim of carrying out experiments on the channel characterization Frequencies to be used are chosen within the range assigned by ITU for satellite telecommunications i.e 81-86 GHz for uplink 71-76 GHz for downlink Being a demonstrative study the IKNOW mission definition is driven by the need to realise a low cost system that could be developed in a short time and could provide the required proof of concept in addition considering the high strategic relevance of W band application for space communications time constraints are fundamental focal points to be considered In this frame the following two mission objectives have been identified for IKNOW  Scientific objectives ri W band satellite channel attenuation characterization oi W band satellite channel quality measurements  Technological objectives ri In-orbit validation of W band hardware and space qualification methodologies On the basis of the mission objectives above outlined the IKNOW payload aims at carrying out two types of measurements both on uplink and downlink power measurements in order to evaluate the signal power level after atmosphere crossing and BER measurements to infer the channel quality Taking into account these experimental requirements the payload design has been realized 3 PAYLOAD DESIGN Basically the identified payload configuration to carry out the above mentioned experiments foresees for the receiving section the reception of a W band modulated signal to be used both to derive BER measurements and to carry out RF power measurements in uplink Moreover the addition of an on-board radiometer allowing for data-gathering when the main receiving chain do not operate is foreseen as optional On the basis of these elements the receiving chain is composed of the following elements 2

reasonable at this stage of the project Without the AGC at least two bit of ADC dynamics would be lost Afterwards the receiving chain is split in two paths In the first one a second down-conversion is used to lower the input frequency 5.5 GHz to 0.5 GHz through the use of a local oscillator at about 5.5 GHz in order to create an output with a magnitude order of tenths of MHz Such a frequency is suitable to be used as input to the ADC All this second down-conversion works as demodulator in order to extract the I and Q components of the modulated signal The second path sends the input signal to the section devoted to the RF power measurements Such a block is basically constituted by an IF amplifier a square detector e.g diode and an analog to digital converter All the measurements are coordinated and collected by a payload controller and later on-board stored or sent to ground through the Telemetry Tracking and Command subsystem TT&C Figure 2 shows some parameters related to the receiving section Figure 2 Receiving section specifications The transmitter chain is basically composed of a frequency generator at about 4.3 GHz which generates a modulated signal with Split-Phase SP Manchester-coded BPSK Modulation Such a modulation scheme is chosen because of the reduction of the complexity of the carrier recovery operation performed at receiver level The signal is then upconverted by using a local oscillator at 80 GHz creating an output at 75.7 GHz After filtering a Solid State Power Amplifier SSPA increases the signal power up to the requested level A power monitor circuit is embedded for power measurements in the transmitting section A suitable number of temperature sensors is distributed within the payload to support radiometer total power measurements Figure 3 shows some parameters related to the transmitting section The on-board system frequency plan has been optimised and through the use of two basic local oscillators at 80 GHz and one at 4.3 GHz we can reduce the number of devices employed lowering on-board mass and power consumption For the design of IKNOW frequency generator it is suitable to employ a push-push VCO Voltage Controlled Oscillator design approach based upon InP HBT technology The design of the IKNOW frequency generator consists in an integrated solution that employs a 80 GHz VCO with a low frequency reference source at 160 MHz The use of push-push principle is a practical solution with good frequency stability and low phase noise and thus allows the tension of the usable frequency range It is possible to integrate a push-push oscillator with buffer amplifier and 8:1 frequency divider on a single MMIC while a commercial PLL chip and a loop filter can be mounted on an external PCB In Figure 4 the functional architecture of the IKNOW frequency generator is shown Concerning the technology to be implemented the most promising approach in terms of performance and mass and volume saving is based on the use of MMIC technology Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit in which passive elements and interconnects are fabricated on the same semiconductor substrate as the active devices All the critical microscopic circuit elements are defined on-chip through photolithography from a scaled-up mask This eliminates the parasitics associated with component packages leads and solder pads Some advantages of this technology are reduced mass and volume with respect to conventional circuit assemblies highly repeatable performance and low-cost fabrication in large-quantities 7 At present the growth in the number of systems using the millimetre-wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is partially founded on the development in the last years of low cost and high performance MMIC circuits 6 The approach identified for IKNOW foresees the realisation of a receiver MMIC technology-based On this basis and concerning the technological approach to be used for IKNOW the following considerations have to be carried out Taking into account the frequency ranges to be used uplink 81-86 GHz downlink 71-76 GHz devices and electronic components are available on the commercial market At present existing commercial hardware components COTS Commercial Off The Shelf are developed also at W band and specifically around 94-96 GHz frequencies at which radar applications exist Figure 3 Transmitting section specifications 4

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
