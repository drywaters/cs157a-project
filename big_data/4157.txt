participants from the University of Southern California University of California Davis and Irvine and Indiana University 12 QuakeSim's distributed architecture is based upon a multitiered Web portal and Web Services model separating functionality from the presentation layer This approach is typical of science gateways 1 Web Services may be generally categorized as providing access to information 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

in 2 For more information on the QuakeSim project the geophysical research work links to the QuakeSim portal and links to the project's open source code repository and build system see 3 2 QUAKESIM WEB PORTAL QuakeSim was a pioneer in the use of portlet components for assembling portals out of reusable parts Our earlier work was based on the Apache Jetspeed 1 portlet container 
As described in 2 the Jetspeed portlet development model had several undesirable features particularly poor support for externally developed Web applications which led to our development of custom components particularly the WebForm Portlet All portlets in the initial version of the portal were extension of this component This component ultimately had limited scalability and performance because of its use of network I/0 for communications between the portlet 
and its Jetspeed container The Java Specification Request JSR 168 standardized and simplified the portlet model used by Jetspeed and other containers making these older containers and their associated components obsolete Although the Jetspeed container served QuakeSim adequately it required updating to a standard-compliant container to enable interoperability with the rest of the science gateway community In particular interoperability with the closely related SCIGN 1 


Data Portal 4 project's GPS Explorer portal 5 is desirable so that we can exchange user interfaces The QuakeSim portal's current version has been developed using the JSR 168-compliant GridSphere container 6 In place of the Web Form Portlet we have adopted the Apache Portlet Bridges project All portlets are now developed initially as standalone applications using Java Server Faces JSF The JSF portlet bridge can then be used to convert these applications into portlets relatively quickly We find this model to be preferable to working directly with the portlet's programming interface A sample screen shot of a portlet is show in Figure 1 Figure 1 Portlets provide browser-based user interfaces to remote web services The screen shot shows a Google Map interface to real-time GPS station monitoring services The current set of QuakeSim portlets is listed below 1 Disloc a simple Okada 7]-based application for determining surface stress from a given fault model 2 Simplex an inversion of Disloc that uses surface deformation information to determine the best fit fault model 3 GeoFEST Suite a set of codes for modeling faults in realistic materials with finite element meshes 4 RDAHMM a data mining application that automatically classifies modes and patterns in time series data such as Global Positioning System GPS positions 5 Analyze tseri part of the ST-Filter suite of codes that is used for filtering GPS signals to help identify anomalies and 6 Station Monitoring a portlet that provides access to the latest real-time GPS data from the California Real Time Network 8 see also Figure 1 These portlets correspond to horizontal tabs along the top of Figure 1 beneath the logo although this particular layout is optional Future work will include the addition of VirtualCalifornia VC which simulates large interacting fault systems VC GeoFEST Disloc and Simplex all use a variation of the same basic geometric model for representing faults We are currently working to standardize this object representation within the portal and with the QuakeTables fault database 9 developers As we discuss in Section 3 all communications between the portal and remote services use SOAP-based Web services We develop these using the Java programming language although the interactions are programming languageindependent Messages enclosed in the SOAP envelope are mapped on both the portal and server side to simple JavaBeans These data objects are kept purposefully simple the beans consist of only simple types strings integers double precision numbers Input output and other data files are represented using URLs and it is up to the implementation to retrieve the file via HTTP GET as a separate step that is we do not use SOAP attachments to move files or encode files as XML SOAP body elements Most portal applications are designed to support a project and session model users create new projects or else load older projects through web interfaces These projects maintain all metadata parameters used location of remote input and output files etc which the user may edit or delete The projects are assigned unique IDs which are used to maintain multiple versions of the same basic project All beans created by the portal through interactions with remote services are stored in an open source object database DB40 see www.db4o.com This replaces our previous Context Manager service see 2 and provides improved performance and scalability The use of beans also provides a useful integration with built-in Java Server Faces functionality 3 WEB SERVICES The portlets listed in Section 2 are clients to one or more supporting remote Web Services that actually access or generate data Data access services include fault models from the QuakeTables service 9 and GPS data the GRWS service 10 We have also in previous work built Web Service versions of the Open Geospatial Consortium's Web Feature and Web Map services Our focus in this section 2 


will be on revisions to the execution services that manage invocations of remote geophysical applications In the process of upgrading the portal front end we determined that the application services that provide access to executables were in need of upgrading Earlier versions of the QuakeSim system were built around the concept of a generic Application Web Service that could wrap any executable This service was built on generic Web services for running remote commands and interacting with remote file systems For related work in this field see 11 and 12 We found ultimately that our Application Web Service approach tied services too closely to the portal environment Web Services ideally should be self-contained stateless or nearly so and completely self-describing This allows them to bind easily to any client environments such as workflow engines portals and desktop user interfaces It also enables other development groups to use the services with minimal guidance from the developer the service's WSDL provides sufficient information for invocation Our original services did not meet these criteria Designing for generality we embedded too many specific steps such as creating application-specific input files into the portal instead of the service Thus the semantics of invoking the Disloc code for example were not encapsulated in a single WSDL file but rather in Application Web Service metadata Our revised service interfaces have been more an effort of code refactoring and reuse than a complete re-write Our core job management service which extends Apache Ant is still in place but no longer exposed directly as a service Instead all new versions of execution services Disloc Simplex etc extend this parent service in the object oriented sense in their implementation We have likewise attempted to design the WSDL for these services to capture all information needed to invoke a particular code A full listing of the service WSDL descriptions is available from the project code repository 3 but we do not include it here since it is generally unreadable by non-experts Instead we summarize the Disloc service's XML messages below as a simple example other applications follow the same general pattern 1 Fault Model this provides a description of major fault geometric and material properties including latitude and longitude of starting and ending points length width strike slip dip and Lame parameters As mentioned previously this model is reusable across many QuakeSim applications and is being adopted by the revised QuakeTables data service 2 Input Parameters Model Disloc calculates surface displacements associated with the fault at either grid or scatter points provided by the user so we must send this information as well as the fault model parameters The current version of the service supports the grid input model The input parameters model contains all information needed to create this part of the input file 3 Output Model the Disloc service creates input output and standard output files The Output Model XML message contains the URLs for these files on the service In contrast to our earlier execution services we do not have a specific file management service that manages uploads downloads and crossloads between services These are instead done with simple HTTP GET operations These messages are XML encodings that correspond to simple JavaBeans in our implementation They may also be bound to C structs or other simple data structures These messages are used to communicate the details of the desired invocation and its results over the wire We use Apache Axis 1.4 for implementing our services All QuakeSim execution services implement blocking and non-blocking invocations of the executable which are inherited from their generic parent class As the names imply blocking executions keep the connection between the client and service open until the invocation is complete This is useful for codes such as Disloc Simplex Analyze tseri and RDAHMM which take typically only a few seconds to tens of seconds to execute Longer running codes GeoFEST and VirtualCalifornia use non-blocking invocations This allows the service to return immediately but the application will continue to run The user can monitor the application by examining messages from the output files and logs returned as URLs to the portal We also provide a call-back mechanism a simple Event Service stores and retrieves messages The running application's Ant wrapper monitors the major stages of the application started or complete for example and posts state changes to the Event Service Clients such as the portal can query the Event Service to determine the current state This service is admittedly simplistic compared to Web Service standards such as WS-Notification and WSEventing but sophistication has often proven to not be virtue A more serious criticism would be our lack of use of general-purpose distributed event systems We do make extensive use of this in our real-time GPS system described in the next section Output files must be usually plotted to be comprehensible Earlier versions of the portal wrapped Generic Map Tool GMT commands with the generic execution service and we also have implemented the Web Map Service for creating plots More recently however we have found tools such as Google Maps and the associated Keyhole Markup Language KML to be a much better mixture of simplicity interactivity and power We have developed KML services that generate grid and arrow plots useful for 3 


visualizing Disloc and Simplex output These services consume Disloc and Simplex output which are passed to the service via URL although future versions of these execution services may incorporate these internally providing the URL of for the generated KML as another part of the execution services return message Figure 2 QuakeSim plotting services create KML representations of Disloc output that can be displayed in Google Maps embedded into portlets The current portal includes Google Maps portlets that plot the KML files although these are memory limited We use the EGeoXML class a small JavaScript extension to the Google Map API for working with KML which we have found superior to Google Map's GGeoXML class We also provide the KML files for direct download which allows them to be included in Google Earth These are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 4 REAL-TIME SENSOR SUPPORT In addition to fault models the other major data types that QuakeSim applications must ingest are seismic events and GPS data Archival GPS data services such as GRWS provide daily position data but there is also interest in realtime and custom data products The California Real Time Network CRTN provides online access to GPS position data at 1 Hz and higher rates will be available in the future We have developed a system using topic-based publish/subscribe distributed computing techniques to manage this data This system is described in greater detail in 13 14 and summarized here The basic components are shown in Figure 4 Raw GPS data is passed through a number of filters which act as subscribers to particular input topics and publishers to output topics An example topic is a path-like name that is used to indicate the network or station source and the data format For example the topic name SOPAC/GPS/PARKFIELD/ASCII is used to publish or subscribe to the ASCII formatted data from the Parkfield network The simplest filters are used to de-multiplex the incoming binary GPS stream The CRTN consists of eight subnetworks each with one or more individual GPS stations The de-multiplexing filters translate this binary formatted signal and extract the individual stations data The filters than publishes the data for each GPS station to a new topic Downstream filters can thus receive individual station data for further processing See for example Figure 1 We can also provide more sophisticated filters For example have developed RDAHMM filters that perform mode classification on the real-time positions Figure 3 Generated KML files can also be downloaded and plotted with Google Earth outside the portal 4 


as I RDAI IMM  Filter He4IU1 k"tel our system with use the QuakeSim project are notably easier to parse and manipulate by JavaScript libraries than the as QuakeSim is just beginning to be felt The QuakeSim portal is primarily based are compatible with serverside QuakeSim services will need to be reconsidered to are noticeably lacking in Web 2.0 5 A mi1ow   IozoI R'O porft use simple stateless invocations known are associated with structured topics Support for Grid Computing QuakeSim applications typically run on small computers and clusters in which batch scheduling and related issues are not important This is adequate for codes such as Disloc RDAHMM Simplex and Analyze tseri However only small GeoFEST and VirtualCalifornia simulations can be done this way Rather than revise our Web Services to address issues such as interactions with scheduling and queuing systems we are adapting our infrastructure to work with the Globus toolkit Our Grid Tag Libraries and Beans project extends Java Server Faces to provide components for invoking Grid services This work is part of our broader Grid portal software efforts the Open Grid Computing Environments project 15 B 1cZnb 1?a5 S atSlon AD M M I Figure 4 A QuakeSim's Sensor Grid system successively filters the incoming binary GPS data from the California Real Time Network Arrows indicate network connections B Filter chains more complicated messages typically used by Web Services The re-emergence of JavaScript following the standardization of the XmlHttpRequest class in most major browsers has driven this simplification if not standardization of network messages The impact of Web 2.0 as iGoogle and NetVibes which aggregate content in new capabilities include more serious incompatibility is that Web 2.0 applications more in control of his see if they we are able to with simple filters deliver data with overhead far below the 1 Hz frequency and on server-side Web technologies portlets and Java Server Faces These access to archival and real-time GPS data in collaboration with the SCIGN team 4 and KML generating Web services for plotting vector output We have two categories of future work summarized below QuakeSim Portal and Web 2.0 As described in or her content This similarly simplifies the process of developing some prominent Web 2.0 examples particularly Google Maps on science gateways such as QuakeSim although implementations may be very different For example most Web 2.0 services as Representational State Transfer REST instead of WSDL Message encoding formats used by these services include simple XML RSS ATOM and JSON in place of SOAP These are important to Grid computing but so that associated with specific data products The system is implemented using the NaradaBrokering messaging software www.naradabrokering.org Extensive network performance and scaling analyses are available from 14 To summarize those results we have demonstrated that or subscribers With networks of brokers the system will scale to larger numbers Our tests with two coupled brokers acting as a single logical broker showed scaling to 1500 connections 5 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have summarized extensive revisions and enhancements to the QuakeSim infrastructure that supersede the earlier work described in 2 These include complete revisions of the portal and the execution Web services The portal has been updated to meet current component standards and the Web Services have been revised to provide simple self-contained WSDL interfaces Prominent more detail in 16 we have analyzed the so-called Web 2.0 trend in Web programming and have concluded it is architecturally nearly identical to science gateways such as we have shown in Figures 1 and 2 However the use client-side integration See for example Start Pages such a manner superficially similar to JSR 168 portlets but which put the new content when compared to the portlet model On the can be made compatible with Web 2.0's favored message formats Most interesting of all is the investigation of the overlap between Web 2.0 and Grids We will as our laboratory for this research Important areas to be addressed include scalable event management singlesign on security service interoperability and authorization All of these user much a single broker scales to 1000 publishers

frames that fall in each one of the subintervals Finally the program uses the number of frames in each subinterval to plot an approximation of the pdf We note that the number of intervals in range of frame types will correspond to the number of points of the pdf approximation This means that if the number of intervals is small then the plot of the approximate pdf will have a small number of points generating some difficulty in trying to determine an approximate pdf for that frame type On the other hand if the number of frames is too large then there is a very good chance that most of the intervals will have a very small number of frames that fall inside of them resulting in a very choppy plot for the pdf approximation Determining a good number of intervals for each type of frames depends in the number of the frames of that type being analyzed Another problem with such an approach is that by changing the number of intervals for the frame type being analyzed in the case in which the number of frames of that type is small the pdf plot generated can change significantly This is due to the fact that a large number of frames may fall on one side of the boundary of such an interval In the case in which one changes the number of intervals these frames will now fall inside a different interval There are some benefits however for using this Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer First of all it provides a very quick plot which is a rough approximation of the frame size distribution Although the approximations generated by the Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer are better the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer generates plots order of magnitude faster Also the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer provides statistics to the user for each type of frames such as mean and variance of frame sizes minimum and maximum frame size Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer In the previous subsection we presented a program which generates a quick and rough approximation of the frame size distribution given the input data from the video traces The problem with that analyzer was that the distribution generated by the program is highly dependent on the quantization level of the ranges of the frame sizes and is generally not a smooth function due to the limited number of frames in the data sets scenario each one of the frames analyzed should be assumed not to have a size which is deterministic but rather comes from a distribution which is centered on that frame size One such distribution generally used for this type of filtration is a Gaussian normal distribution The benefits of using such a filtration are as follows  The distribution generation will not need to use a quantization technique so the program will not suffer from the quantization issue  The frame size distribution generated using such a filtration method will smooth out some of the noise due to the limited number of data points  We have seen that gamma distributions tend to be a good approximation for frame size distribution of each type Since gamma distribution is a smooth function by filtering some of the statistical noise using a filtration it will enable us to better determine the parameters for the gamma distribution which best approximate video for specific mission scenarios Frame Distribution Fitting Tool This tool is used in conjunction with the Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer in order to approximate by a gamma distribution the pdf of the frame sizes for all three types of frames Using this tool the user is able to adjust the two parameters describing the gamma distributions particularly the mean and the K-value which directly influences the variance of the distribution In particular a larger scale will make the distribution taller and narrower For all the data sets the mean of the gamma approximation was taken to be equal to the mean of the true data The K-value was adjusted accordingly in order to best fit the approximation to the true data Analyzed data In this section we present statistical data for the various scenarios proposed This data was gathered using the tools described in the previous sections In Table 2 we provide for each scenario analyzed the mean and the variance of the frame sizes of the I P and B frames We also provide the K-value for the gamma distribution which is centered and the data mean and best approximates the statistical data We plot the approximate gamma distributions for the various types of frames for each one of this scenarios in Figure 3 In this section we present a program which does not suffer from the quantization issue of the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer Also this program filters out some of the statistical noise which is due to the limited data sets We motivate the intuition for this filtration as follows While making a video of a certain mission scenario a small change in the footage i.e the introduction of a small object in the picture may cause a small change in the encoded frame sizes For this reason while trying to derive a generic distribution to characterize a particular type of video 8

Figure 5 Statistically multiplexed traffic We note that in this case we would be able to utilize some of the free channel space for other types of transmissions which may be more delay tolerant see Figure 6 For example in this figure the bottom blue transmission can be thought to be a file which is packetized and needs to be transmitted down from the spacecraft We consider this file to be delay tolerant i.e the data is not needed right away down on the ground and it has a lower priority then the other traffics needed to be transmitted The delay tolerant packets will be transmitted only when the channel is not being fully utilized as to fill in the gaps available in the channel bandwidth This technique will delay the arrival of the delay tolerant traffic but will enable us to more fully utilize our channel bandwidth m T]T m Figure 6 Telemetry traffic along with delay tolerant traffic being sent via a channel We note in above scenario that although the delay tolerant traffic was transmitted at time 0 none of it was able to be transmitted until time 1 Also we note that the final delay tolerant traffic packet was transmitted 9 time instances later then it was received For this reason a buffering scheme must be devised such that all the delay tolerant traffic may be buffered until enough bandwidth for transmission exists Since no specific data was available on the dynamics of the various telemetry type traffics we developed a generic telemetry model which is formed by two types of traffic one constant bit rate which represents the sensory information which is constantly being transmitted down to the ground and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents file download and periodic data updates We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to telemetry constant bit rate  peak of intermittent transmission We will also assume that the intermittent transmission file transfer will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new files are ready to be transferred Using the above model we created a Matlab based tool for synthesizing traffic for simulation purposes The traffic generated by this tool is output to a file in a format which can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 5 COMMAND TRAFFIC MODEL The model for the command will be similar in spirit to the model which we have proposed for telemetry We see the data transmitted for command to be formed by two different types of transmission One constant bit rate which represents calls to various preloaded spacecraft subroutines and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents subroutine uploads to the spacecraft We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to command and we also assume that the intermittent transmission subroutine upload will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new subroutines are ready to be transferred Using this model we have developed a Matlab based traffic synthesizing tool The traffic provided by this tool can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has resulted in the development of a suite of traffic models that captures the fundamental types that will be in the space communications environment and in particular These models provide the capability to investigate the new IP-based communications functions and resulting performance that are required by the human exploration missions of NASA's Constellation Program and the Space Communications and Navigation SCaN network's ability to support them Four prototypical traffic models have been developed from which any number of streams may be generated 1 audio/voice 2 real-time motion imager live video 3 telemetry including both regular periodic data as well as intermittent file downloads and 4 command including periodic data as well as intermittent subroutine uploads The voice traffic model stochastically parameterizes calls talk times and talk spurts Multiple audio analysis tools were developed to assist in the derivation of parameters from data samples taken from relevant space missions Using these tools parameters of probability distributions were fit to data taken from Shuttle/ISS archives 12     n 


The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13
