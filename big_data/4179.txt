has the opportunity to execute the first successful powered landing on an extra-Earth body since the two Viking landers in 1976 A great deal has been learned about Mars from the Viking and subsequent missions that has allowed an unprecedented appraisal of the landing risk and the interaction 
of the spacecraft with the surface during the touchdown event In particular recent images from the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter MRO have provided a detailed appraisal of the landing site rock population and slope variation unlike any before it This information 
has been incorporated into state of the art simulations of the Phoenix lander touchdown dynamics that provide an assessment of the risk to the spacecraft stability and surface operational requirements Unlike the Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover MER missions which used airbags the Phoenix mission will soft land on 
the surface and is subsequently at risk due to the Figure 1 Phoenix lander in its fully deployed and operational surface configuration 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

uncertainty of the terrain and rock abundance Every effort has been made to quantify these risks and to include their effects in both a dynamic touchdown model and a static post-touchdown clearance analysis This paper presents a summary of the major steps taken in these analyses and the results that were obtained and subsequently used to help certify the primary Phoenix landing site 2 LANDER DESCRIPTION The Phoenix lander has a dry mass of 345 kg and is projected to land with about 15 kg of propellant for a total wet landed mass of approximately 360 kg Once on Mars the lander will rest on its three legs with the top of the science deck sitting at a height of 1 m above the surface The lander is powered by two 1.8 m diameter solar arrays and is equipped with a robotic arm that supplies samples to the instruments on the payload deck An illustration of the lander in its operational surface mode is shown in Figure 1 Each of the three main legs is augmented with two diagonal stabilizers that provide the rigidity necessary to maintain the leg positions and aid in absorbing energy during the landing The legs are also each equipped with a Hall effect sensor that is used to indicate when the footpad makes contact with the surface The primary risks to the lander are overturning due to the initial touchdown event a dynamic failure a rock high centering or heavily damaging the lander body and the failure to deploy one or both of the solar arrays the body and solar array modes are considered post landing or static failures The static and dynamic risks can largely be decoupled and are treated using two separate approaches 3 TOUCHDOWN SENSING AND DECLARATION A number of important steps are taken during the terminal descent phase of Entry Descent and Landing EDL in order to guard against a premature or inaccurate touchdown declaration The Phoenix lander is illustrated close to touchdown in Figure 2 One of the prime suspects in the loss of the Mars Polar Lander MPL mission in 1998 was the tripping of the touchdown sensors due to a bounce back phenomenon during leg deployment which if it occurred on MPL would have ultimately led to an early shutdown of the engines resulting in the loss of the lander The vast majority of terrestrial leg deployment tests performed to date for both MPL and Phoenix have activated the touchdown sensor momentarily which supports the MPL report's conclusion The major mechanical events in the EDL timeline are cruise stage separation parachute deployment heatshield separation leg deployment lander separation and touchdown The legs are deployed independently at 0.5 s intervals to minimize any dynamic interaction between the leg deployment mechanisms In addition five seconds after lander separation the touchdown counters are reset to zero Figure 2 Phoenix lander in terminal descent with all 12 descent engines shown firing 2

Figure 4 ADAMS model of the Phoenix lander immediately before touchdown in an arbitrary field of hemispherical rocks simulated the entire entry profile from atmospheric interface up to the point where the lander contacted the surface The entry simulation included winds parachute dynamics radar performance and thruster plume interaction with the ground These terminal state vectors were then used as initial conditions for the ADAMS analysis in determining the dynamic stability of the vehicle on the surface The surface itself was modeled as flat having a local average slope that was representative of the landing site with an arbitrary slope azimuth The surface was then populated by rocks that were generated using the Golombek 1 exponential model at different discrete rock densities because the precise make-up of the rocks at the landing site is unknown several rock densities were run in order to assess the level of risk as a function of the rock field density This information was then convolved with rock density maps generated using HiRISE and geomorphological maps to construct the dynamic component of the landing risk A key component of the lander safety is the interaction of the lander with rocks on the surface Because the precise shape of individual rocks is not known a priori it is necessary to approximate the geometry A number of different shapes were considered but a hemispherical shape was selected as providing a good approximation of observed surface rocks while maintaining an adequate average conservatism overall A hemispherical rock is also much easier to examine computationally which proved to be a significant advantage in the analysis The ADAMS model image in Figure 4 is notional as it shows a simulated field of hemispherical rocks While the rocks were modeled as hemispheres in principle the actual calculations in ADAMS used an even further simplified flat top rock model The lander footprint was first placed in a simulated rock field in order to determine which footpads were in contact with rocks and at what height along the hemispherical surface the contact was made This height was then fed into the ADAMS model as displacements above the surface which effectively simulated the first contact with the rocks One drawback to this is that the position on the rocks remains at a constant height as the footpads are not allowed to slide up or down the rocks this was found to be a minor issue which was overcome by the improved speed and efficiency realized from using the flat topped rocks by avoiding more computationally expensive contact elements The idea of using flat top rocks is not a visually appealing one but analysis has shown that the touchdown event is dominated by the height that the footpads contact the rock and that the actual geometry of the rock plays a lesser role This is largely due to the significance of the descent rate at touchdown which is nominally 2.4 m/s and has requirements to fall within the range of 1.4 to 3.4 m/s The lateral velocity is required to be less than 1.4 m/s and is usually low enough that it plays a lesser role To help compensate for the potential geometric effects of the rocks the footpads are individually assigned random coefficients of friction uniformly distributed from over the range of 0.51.0 Even with the footpad friction in play most dynamic failures were attributed to the effective increase in the local slope caused by large or very unfortunately placed rocks In point of fact if the lander encounters a 2 m rock there is little chance for success 4 c  Iiitoioff 


5 STATIC TOUCHDOWN ANALYSIS The Phoenix lander possesses a wide foot print and low center of gravity which proved to be highly stable in the ADAMS simulations In the end the dominant contributor to the landing risk was actually determined to be the rock/surface interference with the deployment of the two solar arrays Tall rocks close to the lander sides or under one of the lander feet can prevent the solar arrays from deploying completely resulting in a diminished power state There is also a direct risk that the lander body might strike a rock that could result in damage and potentially limit the ability of the scientific payload to function Rocks also affect the dynamics of the lander during the touchdown Figure 5 a as landed configuration with stowed solar arrays b 1st stage of one solar array is complete c 1st stage is complete on one array with the 2nd stage started on the other d one array is deployed with the other array partially through the 2nd stage Figure 6 ADAMS model of the Phoenix lander after touchdown showing solar array and lander body interferences with surface rocks as indicated by the two lightning bolts 5 


event itself but this destabilizing effect has been found to be a lesser problem than the static geometric interferences and is generally treated separately The Phoenix solar arrays deploy in two stages where the center of each array is first swung away from the lander body and into position and then the array panels are deployed by sweeping out a 3600 arc around the center point The two stages of solar array deployment are illustrated in Figure 5 The driving feature of the deployment is the bottom corner of the array which is visible in the lower right of Figure 5\(d This corner sweeps out a circular arc that is below the instrument deck and at the full 1.8 m diameter of the array The result is that any rocks that either interfere directly with the path of the solar array or elevate the footpads sufficiently to cause the ground to interfere can result in partial deployment of one or both of the solar arrays An example of the solar array deployment envelope interference with a hemispherical rock is illustrated in Figure 6 In order to assess the static geometric risk a series of 1-km2 simulated rock fields are first generated in Matlab using the Golombek 1 exponential model It is important to note that the risk to the lander is also a strong function of the rock height to diameter ratio due to the exponentially larger number of smaller rocks For the purpose of this analysis the rocks are again assumed to be hemispherical with a height to diameter ratio h/d  0.5 which has proven to be a good approximation of the surface and orbital observations of Martian rocks The lander is then randomly placed in these rock fields and checked for contact first contact with three lander feet is detected and the lander is reoriented accordingly and second the solar array and lander body volumes are checked for interferences to both the rocks and 0.16 0.14 0.12 l 111111 l 1 1 l 0.12 0.1  0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 k=CFA the surface which is assumed to be locally flat Each different rock density field is analyzed in Matlab with 10,000 landing events and the results are then fit with a polynomial to give a risk curve as a function of the cumulative fractional area CFA covered by rocks The results are shown in Figure 7 for CFA's up to 300O 6 RISK ASSESSMENT RESULTS A summary and comparison of the Phoenix landing risk assessment for static and dynamic events is provided in Table 1 The data presented includes three different rock field densities or CFA's of 5\260O 10 and 15 As noted in the subtext of Table 1 the data are presented in a hierarchal sense such that any case that failed for multiple reasons is removed from the pool of remaining cases so that they are not counted more than once For instance if a landing fails due to an instability caused by a rock under a footpad it would not also be included in the failure to deploy a solar array category In examining the data presented in Figure 7 and in Table 1 it is evident that the landing risk increases markedly with increasing rock coverage It is also clear from Table 1 that the dominant component of the total tipover  rock interference risk comes from the rock interference component which typically makes up about 900o of the total risk to the lander For this reason much of the landing site selection effort has been focused on finding areas of low rock density and the metric for success is taken as the rock interference success/failure probability with the understanding that this represents the majority of the total risk 1663E-02  BDMYPY Poly BDMYPY 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 Figure 7 Probability of failure due to contact with a rock as a function of CFA where all contacts with the body BD or the Y/+Y solar arrays MYPY are included 6

from the FPGA via UDP packets over a direct gigabit Ethern et connection to a PC running a Matlab acquisition program All seemed to work 002ne until we either decreased the decimation thus increasing the data rate over Ethernet or ran long acquisition sessions The ADC input was a sine wave coming from a function generator Looking at the data collected with Matlab we could see that points were being dropped from the sine wave that we fed into the ADC Checking the data rate over Ethernet with a packet sniffer it was observed that the peak rate was only 100 Mbps even though the bandwidth of the connection was 1Gbps But even at decimation rates that could be handled with a 100 Mbps throughput data points were being dropped sooner or later in the acquisition The reason for the lower-than-expected throughput is most likely a combination of the overhead of packetizing the data into UDP packets and computing checksums and the underlying implementation of the IP stack that we used in our system We relied on lwIP Lightweight TCP/IP Stack distributed by Xilinx and designed by Adam Dunkels Swedish Institute of Computer Science to pro vide the dri v ers necessary for UDP communication However as suggested by many user forums it may not run at its full potential on the embedded processor in Xilinx FPGAs Furthermore the receiving PC running a Matlab acquisition program can also be slowing down the communication causing the input rate into the AD7760 controller core FIFO to exceed the output rate Due to the issues experienced on longer acquisition runs using UDP over Ethernet to facilitate FPGA data of\003oad we decided to record a 002xed amount of digitized data directly to a compact 003ash card connected to the development board This method has the bene\002t of easing the load on the CPU as all it needs to do is read the AD7760 controller core FIFO and store that data into external RAM When a speci\002ed amount of data is present in external RAM the CPU stops data acquisition and writes the collected samples to the compact 003ash card Of course the drawback is that we no longer have a 223real-time\224 data acquisition system Furthermore the Xilinx drivers provided for accessing the compact 003ash card are very slow in writing data to a FAT 002lesystem Nevertheless with this method clean and long data captures became possible Synchronization was the last crucial point to check For an FTS synchronization between the signal beam and a reference channel are absolutely critical in order to obtain meaningful data To check for good synchronization in our dualchannel system we simply plotted the data acquired from both channels which comes from the same function generator against each other in order to observe a 1:1 ratio If the signals are not synchronized we would see various patterns or missing points in an otherwise diagonal line passing through the origin 5 M K IV D ATA A CQUISITION To ensure that the AD7760 meets all the requirements of the FTIR data acquisition we have recorded solar interferograms with an existing instrument the JPL MkIV spectrometer designed for stratospheric balloon observations of sunset and sunrise The MkIV optical laboratory includes a coelostat that brings sunlight to the spectrometer for ground-based tests and measurements This allowed us to perform an end-to-end test of our recording system including full veri\002cation of the synchronization between the two ADC channels one for the reference laser and one for the IR signal beam In our lab setup shown in Figure 8\(a we have connected the data acquisition system to the MkIV spectrometer Our FPGA development board Xilinx ML507 has enough I/O to accommodate collecting data from two AD7760 evaluation boards As shown in Figure 8\(b we connect these boards to the output of InSb and reference laser channels Control of the data acquisition process is administered via an RS232 link to a lab computer a acquisition system with the JPL MkIV spectrometer b chain setup showing FPGA and AD7760 boards F igure 8  MkIV data acquisition An interferometer produces an output in the form of a DC term plus AC modulation the signal never goes negative since the lowest possible value is that of total darkness at zero volts It is important to avoid AC coupling and preserve the DC term because the low frequency variations of this DC 8 


term can be used to mitigate the effect of source brightness 003 uctuations Ho we v er  unless special care is tak en this would effectively result in the loss of one bit of ADC precision since no negative numbers would ever be recorded In the case of MkIV the noon-time IR DC term is 0.5 V with a peak AC value of 0.85 V The circuit of Figure 9 maps the MkIV values to the input range of 2.5 V to 2.5 V of the AD7760 With this level-shifting circuit total darkness will be at the negative limit of the ADC the noon-time DC term will be close to 0 volts and the peak interferogram value will use about 2/3 of the positive ADC range This allows us to use most of the dynamic range of the ADC while avoiding any risk of clipping The data-handling software can easily shift the signal back to its all-positive range by adding 2 23 to the recorded values This circuit also provides a differential input and generates the differential outputs needed by the AD7760 this con\002guration has the advantage of being insensitive to common-mode noise G=5 G=1 G=1 2.5 V   Vout VoutVin  Figure 9   Differential ampli\002er for MkIV IR signal beam Figure 10 shows the interferogram centerburst at the zeropath difference ZPD where light from the two interferometer arms interfere constructively at all wavelengths This run was recorded near solar noon and the DC term is correctly mapped to approximately zero ADC count DN digital number The minimum and maximum peaks use about 65 of the dynamic range of the ADC which is 2 23  8  388  608  6e+06 4e+06 2e+06 0 2e+06 4e+06 6e+06 150000 151000 152000 153000 154000 155000 156000 157000 158000 ADC output \(DN Point Index Figure 10   Interferogram centerburst showing ZPD at solar noon We have recorded four spectra with the AD7760 system two near local noon and two in the afternoon A small section of these spectra is shown in Figure 11 The sharp feature in the center of the plot is due to absorption by HF which is of anthropogenic origin 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 4038 4038.5 4039 4039.5 4040 Arbitrary units Wavenumber \(cm-1 HF Figure 11  Four spectra recorded by our V5FXT/AD7760 system The top two traces are consecutive runs near solar noon The bottom two traces taken in mid-afternoon The interferogram sampling frequency was 40 kHz and the reference laser was at 10 kHz resulting in 4 points per laser fringe oversampling factor of 2 Each scan took about 95 seconds to record and 3.8 M points were saved for each channel laser and IR The re-sampling step converted the IR data from the time domain to the path difference domain This includes a digital 002lter which allowed us to decimate the data down to 940 k points The maximum path difference was 57 cm providing a spectral resolution of 0.01 cm 000 1  Simultaneously with the AD7760 the internal MkIV signal chains recorded interferograms by sampling the IR channels on the zero crossings of the reference laser This is the standard method used previously for all MkIV 002eld campaigns this produces data which are already in the path difference domain Because of the external sampling trigger the zero crossing method requires elaborate auto-ranging ADC modules which have fewer bits of precision than delta-sigma ADCs the MkIV instrument uses 18-bit modules Furthermore these modules are hard to adapt to the higher speeds required for satellite instruments Figure 12 compares the data recorded simultaneously by the two systems For this Figure we have averaged the two scans taken at solar noon The signal-to-noise ratio of the AD7760 runs is about 260 which is higher than the MkIV S/N of about 200 We expect to get even better results from the AD7760 when it is properly packaged inside the interferometer enclosure The HF absorption feature provides a stringent test of the system because it is very narrow and it is located near the highfrequency end of the spectrum where the sampling quality is 9

departments on average\ignificant differences were found regarding the age of the applications. The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\. This supports the proposition \(P3.1\ that more interdependent applications also incur higher IT \(operations and maintenance\ts  Impacts of diversity-related AA complexity   Regarding OS-related diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 5\howed no significant difference between the operations costs of more \(Md=93,890 n=105\d less diverse applications \(Md=131,540 n=27\09.5, z=-1.174, p=.24. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007. Hence, the proposition \(P3.4\at applications with a greater degree of overlap also exhibit higher IT costs is not supported  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 12
