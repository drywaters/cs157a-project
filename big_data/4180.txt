I I NTRODUCTION Transistor scaling as described by Mooreês Law has continued exponentially for several decades Dennard Scaling which relies upon lo wering operating v oltage has helped keep chips within practical power envelopes as 
transistor counts and operating frequencies have increased Unfortunately Dennard Scaling has ended and Mooreês Law is slowing down On the other hand we have also seen an exponential growth in data triggered by the increasing popularity of usergenerated content and crowd-sourcing applications This gigantic amount of data has started to go beyond our capability of storing and processing leading to a vast inefìciency gap between silicon technology and the big data Figure 1 shows the data warehouse growth rate compared to the silicon growth rate guided by Moores Law estimated in 
2003 and projected to today The current worlds largest data warehouse is about 3 petabytes from IBM DB2 We can see that there has been a fast increasing gap between the two leading to signiìcant inefìciency and demand to energy If as the World Economic Forum proposes le v eraging this data is key to economic growth in this century then we face some severe technical challenges The energy wall however becomes even worse when security becomes another important design metric other than performance Not only do we have all kinds of personal 
devices that all require various levels of security but we also have large amounts of private data in the cloud which needs to be protected Todays security approaches are mostly adhoc each computing device is protected with some hardware security features as well as software anti-virus tools and rewall Network trafìc are secured by various security protocols and spam ltering techniques As the global internet Figure 1 Size of largest data warehouse growing trend from Winter Top 
T en Surv e y 2003 20 compared to Moore s La w  Such lar ge and still increasing gap indicates a serious energy inefìciency problem in dealing with the large volume of data data volume keeps increasing as shown in Figure 1 the overhead in security will grow as well and soon becomes a nontrivial portion of the total energy budget These security mechanisms cannot be designed independently in an ad-hoc manner any more and energy-aware systematic security will play an important role in system design Our end goal of this work is to provide an understanding of how security mechanisms at different levels interact with 
energy from the perspective of internet data growth so as to emphasize the importance of systematic energy-aware security As a rst step in this short paper we survey the energy cost of several major security mechanisms applied in both individual devices and the cloud We estimate their impact to the energy budget today and also predict the future trend We hope this work serves as a complementary analysis to existing work towards green security 5 6 as well as a reference for future study on energy-aware security In the rest of the paper we survey the following secu 
rity mechanisms that contribute to the majority of energy overhead in security anti-virus software mostly PCs more mobile devices in the future spam ltering on the cloud hardware primitives all kinds of devices network security mostly protocol overhead spent on every bit of data In order to compare them with computation energy we try to normalize them into energy consumption per byte of data

About 90-95 of all emails in the web are spam emails Those spam emails can cause signiìcant problem for both individual users and businesses if not ltered properly Due to the large volume spam ltering can consume a large amount of energy itself Many different parts in the internet are involved in spam ltering collaboratively from ltering spam emails at ISPs to more advanced learning schemes at mail servers such as Gmail Based on a report from McAfee about 5,542 million kWh energy is spent annually 2008 on spam ltering The amount of spam emails sent on 2008 is about 62 trillion The energy consumption per spam email ltering can be estimated as the following Roughly energy is required to lter a single spam email Figure 2 shows the amount of global spam email volume in the past 8 years Although the spam email growth speed seems to be much slower than the global internet data growth rate shown later in Figure 6 a large portion of the spams in fact have shifted into different forms The amount of spam users and accounts now have shown up on various social network platforms such as Facebook and Twitter which becomes a much more effective method compared to traditional email spam and they are much harder to detect and lter as well 11 Hence the total amount of ef fort required for spam ltering will still grow proportionally to the global data volume in general Given the amount of global data volume as 2.55 zettabytes in 2012 the energy per byte EPB for spam ltering can be estimated as Anti-virus software has been heavily used in desktop/laptop PCs for many years It has been well known that anti-virus software are using signiìcant computing resource as well as consuming large amount of energy Although it is difìcult to precisely determine the carbon footprint impact from anti-virus software it can still be estimated based on system performance impact Anti-virus software has major impacts to system boot time application launch time and le I/O operations Many independent organizations are running performance tests on major commercial anti-virus software yearly Table I shows the summarized results from AntiVirus Ware Report on 15 anti-virus softw are The system performance is affected in many different ways all leading to extra energy consumption The major overhead lies in I/O operations that antivirus software is involved in all le accesses through scanning and signature checks As a representative the energy overhead can be estimated based on the File Conversion Time Increase in Table I We estimate the energy spent in the extra time during le conversion by estimating the unit energy for typical computation The experiment in the paper was performed on typical Mp3 les with an average size of 4MB Processor frequency is 2GHz Dual-Core 4GHz maximum computation capability Assuming an average CPI of 1.0 and energy per instruction EPI of 11nJ the ener gy o v erhead per byte can be

An important trend in personal computing is the pervasive availability of mobile devices As the complexity of mobile operating system becomes more complex anti-virus software as well as software rewall will start to become an increasing demand for mobile users A recent study on the energy consumption of mobile anti-virus software shows that they can contribute up to 40 of overall energy under ping oods 1KB payload 100 times per second shown in Figure 3 In the Normal UP case when users are actively using the device with wi on the energy per byte consumed by mobile antivirus tools can be estimated as Many security mechanisms are implemented at the hardware level as primitives in order to provide a much stronger guarantee in a more efìcient way such as Trusted Platform Modules that are available from many chip vendors Furthermore as the exponential increase in the availability of pins on chip hardware resource has become rich enough for more aggressive security approaches implemented in the hardware Most previous research that focuses on the energy breakdown of computing devices are only considering the major energy hungry components such as CPU cache and memory However the increasing complexity of hardware security primitives indicates that energy consumption of hardware security needs to be an important factor in hardware design As an example of security mechanisms embedded in various hardware components main memory has been one of the most widely targeted component for enhanced security policy Research in studies the ener gy o v erhead of tw o potential types of security strategies implemented in the memory memory authentication that protects the integrity of code and data and memory encryption that prevents private data leaking and ensures privacy The results are shown in Figure 4 It can be seen from the gure that advanced security mechanisms embedded in the memory can impose an average energy overhead of 13.42 The experiments were performed on SPEC 2000 benchmark suite which has an average instruction count of 131 billion CPI of 1.97 and data set size of 128MB Assuming a typical processor with 65W power consumption and 2.8GHz frequency from the paper we can estimate the energy per byte consumed in hardware memory security as More aggressively security can be enforced from ground up through every logic gate in the hardware providing a strong guarantee to the system above Recent approaches such as GLIFT and Caisson 14 both tackle the problem through massive changes to the hardware design with dynamic or static information ow tracking techniques The energy overhead of such systematic hardware security approaches can vary from 9 up to 180 for a simple processor design which is expected to further increase when the complexity of hardware grows Other than providing security guarantees locally on devices and systems another important but hidden energy sink is the cost of securing every piece of data while they are been transmitted in the network The integrity and secrecy

Figure 3 Anti-virus and rewall software energy consumption on mobile devices DO WN/UP indicates the state of the W i-Fi T ypical smartphones should spend the majority of time in a standby mode with Wi-Fi up which gives a 200mW overhead in running security software Figure 5 Energy Overhead Analysis of Network Security Protocol of all the data owing around the internet is enforced through a combination of many different security protocols including various encryption/decryption mechanisms and signature systems A recent study analyzes the ener gy o v erhead of all major network security protocols A summary of the results is shown in Figure 5 More frequently performed cryptographic and hash algorithms typically cost microjoule per byte while signature/key exchange algorithms cost milli-joule per byte It is estimated that 50mJ energy overhead is required for a mobile client side to communicate 1 Megabytes over SSL Typical mobile processors consume less than 1/120 eg 0.5W for ARM Cortext TM A9 power compared to desktop counterparts hence the energy per byte consumed in network security for typical PCs can be estimated as Table II S UMMARY E NERGY C ONSUMPTION P ER B YTE OF DIFFERENT SECURITY MECHANISMS  conìgurations Hadoop sort can process 100 records per Joule energy each record contains 100 bytes value and 10 bytes key we can estimate the ener gy per byte for computation as

To put things together Table II shows the energy consumption per byte for each security mechanism we have discussed To have a sense of how much overhead security mechanisms contribute to compared with computation we look at energy efìciency for typical data center computation such as Hadoop Sort It is estimated that under default 002\003\004\005\006\007\010\011\012\013\003\004\014\015\016\007\017\020 021\016\003\006\022\011\012\023\024\025\012\026\003\006\012\027\011\010\003\030 Compared with the total energy consumption of for security security mechanisms cost almost 30 of energy consumed in useful computation Such signiìcant overhead makes the energy wall we have been facing even worse The

Figure 6 The Rapid Growth of Global Data overhead of security mechanisms is also expected to further increase as the data volume increases as shown in Figure 6 which gives the global data growth up to 2020 Based on the data growth rate we can estimate the amount of energy consumed by pure computation compared to the total energy with security overhead included The results are shown in Figure 7 We also include the imaginary energy consumed by computation if data grows at the same rate as Mooreês Law We can see that there is already a big gap between Mooreês Law and the reality while the massively applied security mechanisms further increase such gap We shall pay more attention to energy-aware security mechanisms with more systematic design methodologies III C ONCLUSION Global data has been growing much faster than Moores Law creating an energy wall in designing systems to exploit that data This problem is exacerbated by the increasing demand for security to ensure both secrecy and integrity of all the data in the cloud Those security mechanisms can consume signiìcant energy overhead if designed in an ad-hoc manner In this work we estimate the energy consumption per byte for several major security mechanisms and compare them with the energy consumed in useful computation We estimate that security mechanisms can consume almost 30 of computation energy becoming a giant target for energy efìciency and optimization We propose that more systematic energy-aware security mechanism designs should merit more attention and will play an important role in green IT R EFERENCES  Big data big impact Ne w possibilities for international development Technical report World Economic Forum 2012  Big data infographic Technical report Computer Science Corporation 2012 http://www.csc.com/insights/îxwd/78931big data growth just beginning to explode  AntiV irus W are Anti virus performance tests http://www.antivirusware.com/testing/performance  L Ca viglione and A Merlo The ener gy impact of security mechanisms in modern mobile devices

Finally get through the bottom to top contact in VDS Based on the above definitions, combined with the concept description about the evolution method, especially concepts 9 to 14, analyze the operation behavior about meta concept, instance, attribute, value and relationship. Fig. 6 illustrates the change process of operation behavior in the evolution cycle. When çoper_useré means a person, the evolution about this operation is explicit; and when the operation is generated by the machine automatically, the evolution about this operation is implicit. Considering the oper_nameé, çoper_originé, çoper_timeé and oper_versioné, we can get the details about change process i.e. get the trace of data evolution in the time dimension Meanwhile, çoper_versioné could supports the version filtration in data evolution cycle, so that keeping the consistency of data version               Figure 6 According to the above analysis about data content and operation behavior, combined with the related description of concepts about the analysis modeling, especially concepts 17 to 19, we can get two types of data trace. One is the dissemination trace in the space dimension by analyzing the data relational evolution. The other is the change trace in the time dimension by analyzing the data operational evolution Along the two traces, establish the following rules to support the automatic reasoning of data evolution If there exists relevance between two meta concepts then there might exist relevance between the related instances which belong to these meta concepts; and vice versa If there exists relevance between two instances, then there might exist relevance between the related attribute values which belong to these instances; and vice versa If the number of data visits is large, then the importance degree of data in VDS also might be large Based on these rules, construct the data evolution model of VDS as the following algorithm steps extract the key information from the distributed and heterogeneous data resources, then describe and annotate the semantic information define the core meta concepts, attributes, instances, values and their relationships by domain experts construct the association mappings based on the anylisis of data relationship, and then map the required data to the corresponding sub VDS based on the similarity calculation of data relationships constantly adjust the importance degree of data in VDS according to the behavior analysis, and promote the data evolution in the time dimension continuously optimize the weights of data \(i.e. the similarity at the relational level and the importance degree at the operational level\ed on the reasoning rules, thereby promote the data dissemination in the space dimension, and then realize the real-time and efficient tracking of data evolution In summary, the above modeling process could be able to achieve the efficient management of big data lifecycle by the automatic evolution of data in VDS Because of the big data management faced on the distributed storage mode, we must consider the cost problem about data evolution. Data evolution mainly contains the relational evolution and the operational evolution. So that the cost problem mainly around the following two aspects Considering the data relation ships such as father, son neighbor, similar, opposition, etc., when the data changed the influence range in space should be controllable, and the investment by propagating these influences should be much smaller than the benefit. The investment mainly includes the task time and the storage space. The benefit mainly means the service efficiency Around the data operations such as addition, deletion modification, union, merging, mixture, etc., the data evolution should develop toward the direction of more optimized data service along with the time, and also should be able to get the latest data version in real time It is able to construct the cost model in order to support the quantitative analysis about data evolution. We will consider researching it in the future work V A PPLICATION C ASE  For analyzing the applied effect of theory and method the related approach in this paper about the modeling

The application case of material properties retrieval about the data evolution in VDS During this process, the çPropertiesé is equivalent to a meta concept, its corresponding attribute is çaustenite temperatureé and çsteel typeé. Thereby the value of attribute austenite temperatureé with meta concept çPropertiesé are min800é, çmax1500é and çunit 001\007 
analysis of data evolution is used in the field of materials science for managing the domain big data. We developed a Materials Scientific Data Sharing Service Platform MSDSSP\é to integrate the massive, distributed and heterogeneous data sources of materials field, which based on the related technologies as VDS, big data lifecycle and data evolution. Thereby, provided the data reusing and sharing in the field of materials science, and realized the dynamic, real-time and efficient application services for the material scientists MSDSSP has integrated the massive data resources which could be divided into several major categories, such as the metallic materials, the organic polymer materials, the energy materials, the biomedical materials, the building materials, the road traffic materials, etc. The data nodes distributed in more than 20 research institutes which located in different regions. The data resource sets aggregated various types of relevant material information such as the grades, properties, processing, and so on. They are covered many types of materials scientific data such as the database tables, XML, images, documents, etc. This platform totally collected nearly five hundred thousand data resource items and they keep the continually rapid growth. The relevant demands of complex association and dynamic change are increasingly significant. Considering these characteristics of materials scientific data, it is very suitable for adopting the relevant technologies about data evolution cycle to deal with the issues of big data, which is based on the modeling idea of VDS Take the material properties retrieval as an application case to analyze and validate the data evolution process. Fig 7 describes an application case about data evolution in material field. When we need to find the çstructural steel with the çaustenite temperatureé between the ranges of 800 001\007 and ç1500 001\007 through input the required retrieval condition to get the corresponding retrieval results, and then could get the more rich information about material properties by select the detail  Figure 7 While the value of attribute çsteel typeé with meta concept çPropertiesé is structural steelé. In the result sets of query instance, there are many instances for the meta concept çSteel No.é, such as 08é, ç30é, ç35é, ç50Mné, etc. Then select the relationship detailé about the instance ç30é with meta concept çSteel No.é, could get the related image files as the value of instance ç30é. These related images are respectively named as çTTT curve of Steel No.30é and çSteel No.30 element contents column chart For the data evolution, when some data changes, such as modify the instance with meta concept çSteel No.é from 30é to ç30Sié, this change could spread to the related image name based on the relationship çdetailé. Then the associated values çimage nameé should also be changed to çTTT curve of Steel No.30Sié and çSteel No.30Si element contents column chart Considering the heterogeneous data in materials field are complexly associated and constantly changed, therefore need to timely capture the related changes, and support the real-time data services according the dynamic evolution of data. Accordingly, for the impact of data evolution, VDS could be compared with the traditional database schema and the ordinary dataspace mode. Fig. 8 illustrates the comparison about data evolution among the traditional DB the ordinary DS and VDS by considering the aspect of integrity and accuracy. Select 1000 items of materials scientific data as the specimens of data evolution, analyze the impact of data evolution which is caused by the particular changes within the same time range. It could be

The comparison about data evolution among traditional database, ordinary dataspace and VDS by considering the aspect of integrity and accuracy Fig. 9 illustrates the comparison about data evolution among the traditional DB, the ordinary DS and VDS by considering the aspect of efficiency. Investigate the data evolution process of DB, DS and VDS, and compare the efficiency of evolution, i.e. quantitatively analyze the data evolution rate in different models. It could be seen that VDS has a very good growth trend with time. The efficiency of data evolution has reached 90% in VDS. Compared with it the mode of DB and DS are relatively weak in the aspects of tracking efficiency about data evolution  Figure 9 The comparison about data evolution among DB, DS and VDS by considering the aspect of efficiency In conclusion, through the analysis and description about the above specific application case, preliminarily verified the validity of modeling method about data evolution in VDS And then realize the dynamic and real-time data services for the management of materials scientific big data VI
