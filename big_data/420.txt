the data to an onboard mass-memory and upon command transmit this data to the transmitter at a data rate in excess of 150 Mbps The ISM provides a single board to bridge the gap between the payload and the Communication Subsystem On the input side it provides Low Voltage Differential Signaling LVDS and RS-422 serial channels which receive raw data directly from the payload This data is formatted per standard Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems CCSDS formatting in a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA on the ISM and is stored in the mass storage area of the board until ground communication allows suf\002cient downlink bandwidth Upon command from the spacecraft this data can be played back to an X-Band or Ku-Band transmitter for direct Earth downlink

output to an 8-bit value For dimensions smaller than 9 bits i.e 1 bit 2 bits and 4 bits the data can be concatenated together and accessed in parallel For dimensions larger than 9-bits post-processing serialization is required to parse the data stream into 9-bit data words For this portion of the test test code was written to access the RAM blocks directly and FIFO controllers were eliminated Each iteration instantiated a RAM block with unique dimensions The simplicity of the test ensures that no other components or peripheral logic affect the timing of data in and out of the RAM block All possible dimensions were tested and the results are tabulated in Table 2 The read and write clock frequencies indicate the access speeds of the different RAM con\002gurations The key result is that the two shaded dimensions provide the fastest access times RAM Dims WR Freq MHz RD Freq MHz R Cls C Cls 1x4096x1 156.213 175.439 32 33 1x2048x2 188.501 211.015 32 34 1x1024x4 228.728 220.022 31 31 1x512x9 234.742 220.653 35 31 1x256x18 198.728 202.758 41 28 1x128x36 119.119 131.579 55 28 Table 2  RAM block variable dimension timing Does not include losses from serialization to x 9 bit FIFOs It is interesting to note that the x 9 and x 4 memory widths operate at considerably higher frequencies than any of the other dimensions while the x 1 and x 36 memories operate at the slowest frequencies The fastest way to access a 9-bit memory word in RAM without adding any additional hardware is by instantiating a 9-bit RAM This veri\002es that the con\002guration used in the FIFO controller tests is the most ef\002cient Instrument Input The bandwidth of the instrument interface is dictated by the instrument itself However there is a limit to the rate at which the formatter can operate within the ISM itself As an estimate of instrument input data throughput the WISE MUB CCSDS CADU formatter FPGA module was capable of operating at 41 MHz maximum frequency on 8-bit values giving a maximum data rate of 328 Mbps Compared to the 003ashmemory latencies analyzed in the following section this does not present a bandwidth bottleneck 4 F LASH M EMORY I NTERFACE The 003ash-memory is unique to the data 003ow because information resides there inde\002nitely It divides the receive and transmit interfaces see Figure 10 The system input bandwidth is determined by write latencies to the memory and the output bandwidth by read latencies from the memory Therefore accesses to the 003ash-memory were divided between the write times affecting the instrument input bandwidth and the read times affecting the transmitter output bandwidth Figure 10  ISM Data Flow 003ash-memory interface highlighted in yellow and red Flash-Memory Accesses Flash-memory storage and retrieval is done by page and requires several unique cycles to complete the transaction Waveforms from for both the P age Pr o gr am and P age Read are shown in Figure 11 The 003ash-memory device does not have a separate address and data bus Instead it uses a serial programming scheme that involves commanding addressing and ultimately transferring the data These steps are broken into cycles that produce a memory operation The 002rst cycle is the Command Latch Cycle CLC which indicates to the device what type of access is going to occur 0x80 for data input and 0x00 for data read The second cycle is the Address Latch Cycle ALC which indicates to the part the address of the pending memory transaction by column and row The next cycle depends on which type of transaction is about to occur If data is being programmed to the device the Input Data Latch Cycle IDLC occurs during which the data is transmitted to the part in an 8-bit serial fashion The data is stored temporarily in a quick program buffer inside the memory part After the IDLC the memory device programs the actual memory cells using the data in the buffer The programming consumes most of the time in the programming operation and is responsible for the largest write-time latency If data is being read from the device a pause occurs while the part retrieves the data from the memory cells and 002lls the temporary buffers with the data This pause is similarly long compared to the data programming process and is again the bottleneck in the read-time latency Finally the data is read out in an 8-bit sequential fashion All of these operations are driven by the memory controller in this case the FPGA A page for these particular memories consists of 2112 bytes The individual memory cycle times and bandwidth are discussed in Tables 3-6 Flash-Memory Storage Flash-memory device storage bandwidth to a single 8-bit part is 26 Mbps and would increase to 104 Mbps using four parts in parallel as a 32-bit bus The worst-case write cycle time values are given in Table 3 and the bandwidth at various widths is given in Table 4 6

Figure 15  ISM Data Flow serializer highlighted in yellow the design to ensure the clock-to-outputs of the individual serial signals were all matched indicating that at least on chip the design had no skew Finally we used a test bed layout with HyperLynx to prove that our part to part latencies were within acceptable ranges given the high design speed FPGA Design Rate The FPGA design used to verify the design speed was a relatively simple 8-bit latch and shift register shown in Figure 14 Figure 14 shows that the base clock is twice as fast as the output clock which is meant to simulate a recovered clock This is not necessarily a design requirement but would be necessary if the telemetry clock were an input to the design as was the case on the WISE mission This implies that the maximum frequency given by the timing tool for the design is twice the output clock Figure 14 shows only an 8-bit shift register but naturally depending on how the memory was organized more might be required The more bits used in the shift register the more internal clock skew slows the design If a wider bus were required it would be better to increase the depth of the input registers to maintain a high-speed design as opposed to increasing the number of output shift registers The results of this test were a maximum device clock speed of 336.7 MHz double data rate and a maximum output clock speed of 168.35 MHz in the Actel RTAX2000S as given by Actel Timing Designer This meets our requirement of 150 MHz on the clock signal with a margin of 12 FPGA Design Skew Using this same prototype design and mapping the outputs to physical pins we ensured the pin-to-pin skew was matched This skew is the amount of time it takes the edge to propagate from the internal logic to the physical pin on the part The results were as follows Path 1 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 2 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK N Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 3 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 4 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA N Clock to Out ns 7.014 The clock-to-output skews are all matched indicating the clock and data signals leave the part simultaneously and no delay is caused by mismatched skew Board Latency Simulation After a preliminary board layout was completed board simulations were performed on the signals from the FPGA to the LVDS repeater and ultimately to the front panel as shown in Figure 16 All of these simulations were performed in HyperLynx Boardsim 8.0 with manufacturer-provided IBIS models for the Integrated Circuits ICs The waveform given in Figure 17 is captured at the FPGA Figure 16  ISM Data Flow buffer highlighted in yellow Figure 17  FPGA LVDS output waveform simulations green/red  single-ended clock at FPGA blue  differential clock at destination The HyperLynx simulation was performed using a signal switching speed of 180 MHz to ensure adequate margin for the desired signal frequencies The rise times given in Table 9 are roughly one-tenth the simulated signal period 5.5 ns at 180 Mhz indicating they will not impede the switching frequency by slowing the time to the threshold voltage at the receiver The simulated scope shots for these signals indicate crisp edges and transitions The receiving part is an LVDS bus repeater meant to protect the radiation-hardened FPGA from any front-panel transients that might inadvertently occur during testing At the input to the repeater the simulated signal waveform is given in Figure 18 The transition regions for LVDS are shown as blue lines in Figure 18 While there is a considerable amount of overshoot 11 


Figure 18  LVDS signals at buffer input difference shown and re\003ections on the signal line from the repeater the transition region of the signal is very clean even simulated at 180 MHz This will easily meet our 150 MHz frequency requirement Signal characteristics are tabulated in Table 9 Signal Rise Time ps Fall Time ps Undershoot mV Overshoot mV Margin mV CLK 729.0 698.4 212 250 288 CLK903.1 685.4 256 150 244 DATA 738.9 702.8 216 250 284 DATA876.4 717.8 256 150 244 Table 9  FPGA LVDS output signal characteristics In addition to signal characteristics and waveforms the signal-to-signal skew was measured at the buffer input Obviously these values should be as small as possible to prevent modifying the board Like most differential signaling modes LVDS requires matched impedance signal pairs to function optimally HyperLynx was used to 002ne tune the termination on each differential pair and to match all of the trace impedances to this termination The skew was minimal Table 10 First LVDS Signal Second LVDS Signal Receiving Rise Skew ps Receiving Fall Skew ps CLK DATA 58.32 50.54 Table 10  LVDS rising and falling skew measured at receiver The Receiving Rise and Fall skews are the values for skew between the two signals as each signal passes the LVDS threshold voltage measured at the FPGA The time difference between these two crossings is the number shown in Table 10 Rise skew is measured on the rising edge and fall skew is measured on the falling edge as illustrated in Figure 19 Figure 19  LVDS receiver slew measurement Given that these skews were measured at 180 MHz skew between signals at 150 MHz will not inhibit data transfer by allowing the clock and data lines to get out of sync 6 C ONCLUSIONS It is clear that there are many places where timing is of great concern in the ISM data 003ow The initial data input is driven by the instrument interface timing the bandwidth of the FPGA FIFO buffers the speed of the formatter FPGA and the bandwidth of write accesses to the 003ash-memory The transmitter side of the data 003ow is dependent on the bandwidth of the read accesses to the 003ash-memory the FPGA FIFO buffer bandwidth the FPGA serializer frequency and the physical signal characteristics of the FPGA to the frontpanel interface A table summarizing all of these bandwidths in the order they occur in the data 003ow is presented in Table 11 Data Flow Block Bandwidth Units INSTRUMENT INPUT FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps Formatter FPGA Bandwidth 328 Mbps Flash-memory Write Bandwidth 104 Mbps TRANSMITTER OUTPUT Flash-memory Read Bandwidth 866 Mbps FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps FPGA Serializer Bandwidth 168 Mbps Table 11  Bandwidth summary In order to support our study signal integrity analysis was performed on the portions of the data 003ow affected by physical delays including into and out of the 003ash-memory and from the FPGA to the front panel These physical interfaces are robust enough to support high data throughput rates The ISM is capable of interfacing to an instrument with up to 104 Mbps of continuous data throughput and is capable of 12 


sourcing data to a transmitter at a bandwidth up to 168 Mbps This allows data to be stored to the ISM during the orbital encounter period and downlinked periodically as communications are available R EFERENCES  223R T AX-S/SL RadT olerant FPGAs 224 Actel Corporation Mountain View CA 2008 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/products/milaero/rtaxs/docs.aspx  223Prototyping R T AX-S Using Axcelerator Devices,\224 2003 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/techdocs/appnotes/rtaxs.aspx  223K9XXG08XXM Datasheet 2G x 8 Bit  4G x 8 Bit  8G x 8 Bit NAND Flash Memory,\224 Samsung Electronics 2007  223UT54A CS164245S/SE Schmitt CMOS 16-bit Bidirectional MultiPurpose Transceiver Datasheet,\224 Aero\003ex Corporation Colorado Springs CO 2009 Available http://aero\003ex.com/ams/pagesproduct/prodshirel-16bitlogic.cfm B IOGRAPHY  John Dickinson is a Research Engineer at Southwest Research Institute Having studied Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University with a focus on control systems and signals he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division He was the lead Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for the WISE and Kepler Mission Unique Boards MUB for which he compiled and integrated the GSE hardware developed the test scripts and wrote and veri\002ed the GSE code He is the Lead Engineer for the JUNO JADE Instrument Processor Board a lowpower RAD-HARD 3U Compact PCI single-board computer that utilizes the Atmel LEON2 SPARC v8 processor and provides direct instrument and spacecraft serial interfaces He has supported integration systems engineering and promotional efforts on a variety of programs and is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology Charlie Howard  a Principal Engineer in the Department of Space Systems at Southwest Research Institute excels as system architect and digital designer with particular expertise in FPGA and ASIC design Mr Howard has 002lled an active role in the hardware/software architecture for the MMS Mass Memory Module MMM and is the designer of the Mass Memory Controller FPGA Mr Howard is the architect and designer of WISE Mission Unique Board MUB the Kepler Command and Telemetry Board CTB and the Orbital Express CTB and provided multiple FPGA designs for OE Kepler WISE and MMS As Kepler CTB lead he incorporated new simulation capabilities allowing the customer to verify advanced features of the Kepler CTB prior to delivery As an ASIC and FPGA designer Mr Howard 002lled roles in RTL design functional and gate level veri\002cation for high reliability systems including space telecom and defense applications His other interests are worst-case timing and signal integrity analyses Steven Torno is an Electrical Engineer at Southwest Research Institute He studied Electrical Engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute for Technology with a focus on digital signal processing and he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division in 2009 He was the Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for a Control and Telemetry Board CTB demo in partnership with ATK Space Systems where he integrated existing GSE hardware with custom test software he wrote and veri\002ed He is currently an Electrical Engineer for the Robotic Lander Test Bed project working on the Low Voltage Power Supply LVPS board He is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at San Antonio 13

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
