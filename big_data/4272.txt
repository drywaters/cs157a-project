through NASA's Earth Science Technology Office ESTO we have developed techniques that enable such assets to be dynamically combined to form sensor webs that can respond quickly to short-lived events and provide rich multi-modal observations of objects such as clouds that are evolving in space and time A key focus of this work involves relating the observations made by one instrument to the observations made by another instrument We have applied approaches derived from data mining computer vision and machine learning to 
automatically establish correspondence between different sets of observations We will describe a number of Earth science scenarios that were used to direct this development and which have benefited from the approach.12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION

2007 toolbox includes purely data-driven methods as well as hybrid approaches that utilize metadata and ancillary information such as sensor geometry and geolocation parameters The toolbox also includes image co-registration techniques based on matching viewpoint invariant descriptors A well-documented application programming interface API has been developed which will allow future Earth Science sensor webs to leverage these capabilities in much the same way the numerical computing community has leveraged tools like LINPACK/LAPACK 1 and Numerical Recipes 2 2 BACKGROUND The current suite of 
spaceborne and in-situ assets provides distributed sensing of the Earth's atmosphere oceans and land masses A sensor web goes a step beyond distributed sensing and attempts to create a set of interconnected agents or nodes which can jointly make observations of the environment Arguments for coupling agents together into sensor webs revolve around two themes O Timeliness Agents must quickly share information and act so that an important opportunity will not be lost Note that in the absence of time pressure 
the agents could simply downlink and centralize their data on the ground for later analysis as in the classical distributed sensing paradigm O Resource Limitations Individual agents are in some way deficient not having the ability to perform certain duties without the aid of other agents For example agents may have to work together simply to make their measurements e.g bistatic radar or to communicate their data e.g via an orbiting relay station packet multihopping in networks 
with limited-range radio links This situation also arises if agents do not locally have sufficient power computing ability or other resources Each agent in a sensor web has an internal state that is derived in part from the agent's own observations i.e sensory input as well as from messages the agent has received from other agents At any instant in time an agent chooses an action based on its current state Potential actions are platform specific but could include 1 


o Use actuators to move point scan or deploy o Modify data collection parameters to turn on/off a given instrument choose spatial spectral or temporal sampling set transmit polarization or power calibrate an instrument etc o Communicate information to another agent or agents o Modify internal state to change to a different mode latch data for later use compute a derived quantity from available data set a timer or event trap etc The Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment ASE onboard EO-1 has provided one of the most compelling sensor web demonstrations to date 15 The EO-1 satellite has been linked with other satellite and ground assets to provide a global surveillance capability for science and environmental events such as flooding fires and volcanic activity Adaptive Sky is not a sensor web demonstration per se but instead aims at developing underlying technology to support a variety of sensor web concepts We focus on the narrower problem of relating the observations of one agent at time t to the observations of another agent at time t Toward this goal we have developed both metadata and data-driven functions which are encapsulated in a well-tested and welldocumented C-language toolbox The toolbox concept should allow future sensor web applications to readily ingest this functionality 3 EARTH SCIENCE RELEVANCY In the late 1980's NASA conceived the Earth Observing System EOS program a series of missions to study the Earth using sophisticated new sensors and provide the data to increase scientific understanding of global climate change 3 From the very beginning of the program distributed sensing was a fundamental component of EOS 4 and this aspect remains important with the completion of the A-Train of instruments expected in early 2008 5 Although Adaptive Sky is intended to be applicable to a variety of sensor web concepts we have found it useful during development and testing to focus on a few prototypical scenarios involving the scientific study of clouds with sensor webs For our test scenarios the observations from the EOS instruments on the Terra satellite and on the A-Train group of satellites provide realistic data to develop and showcase the capabilities of the toolbox Clouds are a dominant feature in the atmosphere playing a central role in regulating the energy budget of the planet and regulating the hydrological cycle 6 Understanding clouds and their impact on the climate system of the Earth is a major challenge that cuts across a number of Earth Science disciplines including Atmospheric Science Hydrology and Climate Studies Moreover knowledge of the true three-dimensional 3-D nature of clouds particularly their interactions with radiation and atmospheric pollutants is exceptionally limited as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC 7 Current observational capabilities have only recently begun to address the 3-D cloud measurement problem In isolation measurements from EOS instruments have limited utility for global studies due to their restricted horizontal spatial coverage and sparse temporal coverage For example over the 16-day ground-track repeat cycle of the CALIPSO satellite the CALIOP lidar samples less than 0.2 of the total surface area of the planet including day and night ocean land and polar regions 8 However it is only in those places sampled by the lidar that high vertical resolution data is available about cloud and aerosol layers On the other hand ground-based sensing sites such as those operated by the Department of Energy DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement ARM program provide dense temporal measurements but only in isolated locations This project used the feature correspondence toolbox to demonstrate a cloud sensor web simulation in which multiple complementary measurements of a cloud element over time from a variety of instruments are automatically combined to provide more complete information about the physical nature of the cloud 4 THE SCIENCE SCENARIOS Four scenarios relevant to Earth Science were identified to help foster the development of the toolbox as well as demonstrate its capability upon completion These scenarios are 1 Match-ups between the morning and afternoon constellations of EOS satellites The morning Terra satellite carries the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer MISR The afternoon constellation is known as the A-Train 5 The Aqua satellite carries a second MODIS instrument and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS Following Aqua are the CloudSat satellite and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations CALIPSO satellite The former carries a cloud radar while the latter carries the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP a wide-field camera WFC and an infrared imaging radiometer IIR 5 2 Rapid matching of non-georectified MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua images containing wildfire detections 2 


3 Multi-instrument observations of the effusive eruption plume of Mt Saint Augustine in Alaska in early 2006 4 Correspondences between satellite and ground-based observations of clouds over the Santa Catalina Mountains near Tucson Arizona The ground-based observations were acquired by Joseph Zehnder at Arizona State University and colleagues in the summer of 2006 as part of the Cumulus Photogrammetric Insitu and Doppler Observations CuPIDO field campaign The EOS match-up scenario yields increased information about atmospheric processes including cloud-top height and cloud formation and development while at the same time providing important intercalibration information regarding the sensors and the retrieval algorithms themselves These matches require both metadata-level intersection queries and data-level feature matching Interest point operators based on finding corner-like or blob-like structure are first applied to identify keypoints in each image This step is followed by extraction of viewpoint invariant descriptors such as the Scale Invariant Feature Transform SIFT descriptors developed by David Lowe 9 The ability to rapidly match non-georectified MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua images containing wildfire detections is an application of the approach developed for the EOS match-up scenario In order to return timely observations the georectification step which requires metadata files that are produced operationally once the satellite data are downlinked is bypassed The keypoints themselves are used to transform the raw JPEG images into a coordinate system common to one or other of the images This illustrates the capability for future on-board processing for automatic image co-registration for change detection Mt Saint Augustine is a 1260 m high stratovolcano that forms Augustine Island located at approximately 59.362\260 N 153.4310 W in the southwest portion of Cook Inlet approximately 290 km from Anchorage Alaska Augustine began erupting explosively on 11 January 2006 continuing until 28 January at which point it entered a continuously erupting phase that lasted until 2 February 10 The explosive eruptions of Augustine in January 2006 were difficult to monitor from satellites because the volcano was obscured by clouds and/or the eruptions occurred at night 11 However by the beginning of the continuously erupting phase on 30 January conditions had improved allowing the volcano to be observed by a number of sensors on the EOS Terra and Aqua satellites often within a few hours of one another as well as from the NOAA Doppler Weather Service Radar WSR-88D in Anchorage and an aircraft from the Alaska Volcano Observatory AVO This provided a unique opportunity to study the detailed behavior and characteristics of the Augustine plume using the various capabilities of these sensors as well as explore the limits of detectability of the plume Although the CloudSat and CALIPSO satellite had not yet been launched this case provides an overview of the type of science that the sensor web toolbox can facilitate Finally the satellite-CuPIDO scenario provides important new information on cloud 3-D structure and development Feature matching approaches are again essential for identifying and reacquiring individual cloud elements from differing perspectives to facilitate this work In the more difficult version of this scenario dense temporal observations of clouds at a fixed spatial location were required to be converted into a prediction of the spatial distribution of the clouds over a broader area at the specific time of the satellite overpass Rather than relying on keypoints it was decided to focus on maximally stable extremal regions MSERs which seemed more appropriate for this task 12 5 TECHNICAL APPROACH Recognizing that the feature correspondence problem arises in a number of sensor web concepts the toolbox was constructed to contain algorithms that will provide future projects with technically mature ready-to-use solutions According to a review 13 more than 1000 papers were published on image registration alone in the 1990's With so many approaches it is neither feasible nor desirable to attempt to include every possible approach in the toolbox Instead we focused our initial efforts according to the following principles and constraints O Factoring Common Subproblems Feature correspondence can typically be broken down into common subproblems such as defining and locating features characterizing a feature with attributes parameterizing or penalizing the geometric distortions matching features on one signal with features from another according to some objective function deriving a transformation from the correspondences and verifying or grading the proposed transformation at the whole signal level We attempted to create separate methods to address these subproblems The critical issues of feature extraction and matching and the specific approaches chosen to handle them are discussed in more detail below O Factoring Domain-specific Elements We did not wish to over-tailor the toolbox to a specific sensor or situation within limits As much as possible domain-specific information was factored out so that such information can be used by the algorithms rather than being part ofthe algorithms Features The first choice in defining a correspondence algorithm is determining what kind of features to use In some 3 


algorithms image patches local brightness patterns are used directly as features In other cases simple geometric constructs such as points edges lines ridges and corners are used instead Image patch features are difficult to use if there are significant differences in viewing geometry and lighting conditions or if the image is relatively homogeneous and thus lacking identifiable features Even worse pixel values cannot be directly compared between instruments that use different sensing modalities e.g infrared vs visible or visible vs radar backscatter Feature-based Image Registration One of the methods developed for the Adaptive Sky toolbox addresses the problem of automatically registering images of the same scene or object taken from different viewpoints and at different times The method is a feature-based approach inspired by the work of David Lowe 9 The technique is robust against change in image scale rotation 3D distortion change in viewpoint and change in illumination The method first identifies interest points from scale-space extrema in a difference-of-Gaussians DOG filter and extracts invariant feature descriptors at the interest points The invariant feature descriptors are matched between images to establish tentative correspondences From the tentative correspondences RANSAC Random Sample Consensus 14 is used to estimate an initial homography transformation and select inliers The homography inliers are used to recover the epipolar geometry and reject any remaining outliers The Thin Plate Spline algorithm is then used to estimate the non-rigid transformation and further refine the image registration Segmentation-based Cloud Tracking Another method developed for the Adaptive Sky toolbox focuses on the problem of extracting and tracking blob-like features Segmentation is the process of separating an image into approximately homogeneous regions for example based on intensity color or texture The main challenge is to find matching regions in two images of the same scene despite significant differences in viewpoint and differences in the sensor characteristics We have implemented the maximally-stable extremal region MSER approach 12 and applied this technique to track cloud features in image sequences taken from ground-based cameras MSERs are regions of the image Conceptually they are obtained by finding connected components of thresholded versions of the image at various thresholds Connected components that are stable with respect to their size over a wide variation in threshold are taken to be MSERs In practice more efficient algorithms exist for finding MSERs i.e it is not necessary to explicitly run a connected components algorithm at each threshold value MSERs have the advantage that they are closed under continuous geometrical transformation of image coordinates and closed under monotonic transformation of image intensities making them especially useful for tracking the movement and formation of clouds After MSERs are extracted from the images the next step is to identify matching MSERs between the two images Because we are dealing with images taken from the same viewpoint with relatively small time separation between images we are able to reliably perform this matching using simple location size and shape features The approach in 15 uses more sophisticated affine-invariant moment features but we have not found that to be necessary in our work with CuPIDO cloud sequences 6 RESULTS Results of the feature-based image registration algorithm are presented for images of clouds and land taken from the MODIS instrument on Terra and the MODIS instrument on Aqua On a given day there are a number of footprint collisions between these two instruments in which one instrument images a particular geographic area and sometime later the other instrument images part of the same geographic area In the northern latitudes of the United States and southern latitudes of Canada these footprint collisions occur with approximately 3 hour time separation Figure 1 a shows an image taken by MODIS on Aqua centered roughly on Washington state while Figure lb shows an image taken by MODIS on Terra of the same general area taken about three hours later Figure 1 Aqua MODIS image centered on Washington 4 


state b Terra MODIS image of the same general area taken three hours later Figure 2 shows extracted DOG interest points from the Terra image At each interest point SIFT descriptors 9 are extracted These descriptors provide a robust description of the gradient information in a local neighborhood of the interest point Figure 4 shows tentative matches between SIFT descriptors in the two images Subsets of these tentative matches are used to estimate a homography transformation between the two images A homography transformation can be estimated from just four correspondences The number of tentative correspondences that are consistent with the estimated homography is used as a figure-of-merit to say how good is the estimated homography Different homography estimates are obtained and evaluated using different subsets of the tentative correspondences The best homography is retained as a first order solution Correspondences that are at least loosely consistent with the homography are then idenified as inliers while the other tentative correspondences are rejected as outliers The process is repeated using epipolar geometry in place of the homography transformation Epilopolar geometry is captured through the so-called fundamental matrix F which can be estimated from a minimum of seven correspondences Although seven is the minimum we have used the more robust 8-point algorithm in our work RANSAC is again used to estimate F and the best F is identified Correspondences that are loosely consistent with F are retained while others are rejected as outliers In the final step a thin plate spline TPS is used to allow for smooth nonlinear deformations between the two images This technique is commonly used in medical image registration The final result is shown in Figure 4 Here we have created a color image in which the red component is the original Terra MODIS grayscale image from Figure lb and the cyan component blue and green channels is the TPS-warped version of the Aqua MODIS grayscale image from Figure la Regions that appear gray are areas where the two images align well Colored regions show areas where the registered images did not map well Aside from the red areas in the corners which represent areas seen by MODIS Terra but not by MODIS Aqua most of the registration differences are due to cloud motions which for our studies is the scientifically-interesting component Note that this result is obtained in a completely data-driven manner we do not rely on the satellite ephemeris or attitude data except to note in a coarse way that there is a footprint collision between the two instruments Results of the MSER extraction and tracking algorithm are shown in Figures 5\(abc Figure 2 DOG interest points on the Terra image of Figure lb Matched keypoints on 11 Matched keypoints on 12 20 0 0 40 5060 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 Figure 3 Tentative matches between SIFT descriptors in Aqua MODIS and Terra MODIS images 5 


Figure 4 Co-registration of Aqua MODIS image and Terra MODIS image 3 hour time separation Red  Terra image Cyan  warped Aqua image 7 DISCUSSION The feature-based image registration algorithm appears to work quite well for registering the land The next step is to establish registration between the cloud elements One possibility for this step is to remove all the features that have been successfully accounted for by the geometrical transformation from one image to the other The remaining features could then be re-examined using the same procedure to recover a second dominant motion Because the SIFT features are somewhat sparse in the cloud interiors it is not clear whether this approach will work i.e whether there will be enough features on just the clouds Another option is to adapt the MSER tracking approach that we have thus far mainly considered for the CuPIDO image sequence data to segment the clouds into blobs and then try to establish correspondence between the blobs based on factors such as size shape displacement Here predictive dynamical models for example driven by auxiliary wind information could be incorporated into a Kalman filter framework to improve the association process Figure 5 MSERs extracted from a sequence of CuPIDO ground camera images 5 minute time separation 6

port based spacecraft health monitoring and fault diagnosis As a part of our future work we plan to investigate a systematic procedure to generate the CDM parameters possibly by utilizing information on component fault statistics i.e histograms of faults representing the in\003uences of the faults in a node on its child node as well as by exploiting the structural properties of our model Extension of the proposed CDM to a dynamic Bayesian network-based CDM will also be an interesting research that may be pursued A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is supported in part by a Strategic Projects Grant from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada NSERC R EFERENCES  D L Iv erson 223System Health Monitoring for Space Mission Operations,\224 in Proc 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference  Big Sky Montana USA March 2008 pp 1\2268  J K urien and M D R-Moreno 223Cost and Bene\002ts of Model-based Diagnosis,\224 in Proc 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference  Big Sky Montana USA March 2008 pp 1\22614  A Barua and K Khorasani 223Intelligent Model based Hierarchical Fault Diagnosis for Satellite Formations,\224 in Proc 2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics SMC 2007  Montreal Canada October 2007  227\227 223Multi-Le v el Fault Diagnosis in Satellite F or mations using Fuzzy Rule-Based Reasoning,\224 in Accepted 2nd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aeronautics and Astronauticss ISSCAA 2008  Shenzhen China December 2008  A Barua P  Sinha and K Khorasan i 223A Diagn ostic Tree Approach for Fault Cause Identi\002cation in the Attitude Control Subsystem of Satellites,\224 Accepted for Publication in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems  2008  A Joshi V  Ga vriloiu A Barua A Garab edian P Sinha and K Khorasani 223Intelligent and Learningbased Approaches for Health Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of RADARSAT-1 Attitude Control System,\224 in Proc 2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics SMC 2007  Montreal Canada October 2007  J P earl Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems Networks of Plausible Inference  San Monteo CA USA Morgan Kaufmann 1988  F  V  Jensen and T  D Nielsen Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs  2nd ed NY USA Springer 2007  R Ganguli 223 Application of Fuzzy Logic for Fa ult Isolation of Jet Engines,\224 Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power  vol 125 No 3 pp 617\226623 July 2003  W  W ang 223 An Inte lligent System for Ma chinery C ondition Monitoring,\224 IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems  vol 16 No 1 pp 110\226122 February 2008  T  Y airi Y  Kato and K Hori 223Fault Detection by Mining Association Rules from House-keeping Data,\224 in Proc International Symposium on Arti\002cial Intelligence Robotics and Automation in Space  2001  M A Sw artw out 223BEAM T echnology for Autonomous Self-Analysis,\224 in IEEE Aerospace Conference  Big Sky MT March 2001 pp 2989\2263001  R Gessne r  B K osters A He\003er  R Eilen ber ger  J Hartmann and M Schmidt 223Hierarchical FDIR Concepts in S/C Systems,\224 in Proc 8th International Conference on Space Operations SpaceOps2004  Montreal Canada May 2004  J K orbicz J M K oscien y  Z K o w alczuk and W Cholewa Eds Fault Diagnosis Models Arti\002cial Intelligence Applications  Germany Springer 2004  H A T alebi and R P a tel 223A Neural Netw orkBased Fault Detection Scheme for Satellite Attitude Control Systems,\224 in Proc 2005 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications CCA-2005  Toronto Canada August 2005 pp 1293\2261298  N T udoroiu and K Khorasani 223Satellite Fault D iagnosis using a Bank of Interactive Kalman Filters,\224 IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems  vol 43 No 4 pp 1334\2261350 October 2007  I A Al-Zyo ud and K Khorasani 223Neural Ne tw orkbased Actuator Fault Diagnosis for Attitude Control Subsystem of an Unmanned Space Vehicle,\224 in Proc IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN-2006  Vancouver Canada July 2006  Z Q Li L Ma and K Khorasani 223 A Dynamic Neural Network-based Reaction Wheel Fault Diagnosis for Satellites,\224 in Proc IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN-2006  Vancouver Canada July 2006  A V aldes and K Khorasani 223Dynamic Neural Network-based Pulsed Plasma Thruster PPT Fault Detection and Isolation for the Attitude Control System of a Satellite,\224 in 2008 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN 2008  Hong Kong June 2008  R Isermann 223Model-based Fault Detection and Diagnosis\226Status and Applications,\224 Annual Reviews in Control  vol 29 pp 71\22685 2005  G J W ells R E Zee and C J Damaren 223Hardware Emulation Strategies for Concurrent Microsatellite Hardware and Software Development,\224 Canadian Aeronautics and Space Journal  vol 48 No 1 pp 87\22695 12

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
