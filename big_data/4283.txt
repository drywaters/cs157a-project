Routing protocol selection in Mobile Ad Hoc Network is a big challenge, because of its regular topology changes and routing overhead. In Manet, energy efficient protocols are used to forward data packets one to another without much packet loss. Energy reactive routing protocol is effective routing protocol in Manet and nodes are requires energy efficient routing protocols to bound the power consumption, and lengthen the battery life to improve the life time of the network. The main objective of this paper is to enhance the network performance of different routing protocols when frequent link failure in network due to mobility of the nodes in the network. The performance analysis and simulation are carried out to evaluate network performance using Network Simulator \(NS-2\, based on the different load, node mobility delay, packet sending rate and energy consumption. It has been verified through various simulations, which represent a wide range of network conditions that energy AODV deliver the better performance as that of the modern protocols DSDV, TORA DSDV, DSR and AODV in terms of energy efficiency but it is observed that DSR needs significantly smaller energy overheads than other protocols Keywords  AODV, DSR, DSDV, TORA, MANET, Energy efficient routing I I NTRODUCTION A Network is a set of interconnected nodes. A mobile ad-hoc network [1, 2 is  a n e tw o r k w h e r e t h e r e  is  n o f i x e d  infrastructure. All wireless facilitated devices within the range of each other can discover and communicate in a point-topoint approach without linking central access points [3   Mobile ad networks and devices are becoming increasingly popular because they provide user access to information and communication anytime and anywhere. There is no need for router individually as each node can work as host as well as router accordingly. Each node or mobile device is prepared with a transmitter and receiver. The topology of mobile ad-hoc network is dynamic and depends upon the movement of the nodes accordingly it can change rapidly and unexpectedly. In exacting, a very large number of recent studies focused on Mobile Ad-hoc Networks \(MANETs\ [1, 4   T h e p e r f o r m a n c e  analysis of a mobile ad-hoc network depends on the routing scheme employed, and the conventional routing protocols do not work efficiently in a MANET In MANET Energy efficient routing protocols are the only solution to above circumstances. Most of the existing work of making protocols energy efficient has been done on ìon demand routing protocolsî because thes e protocols are more energy efficient rather than proactive protocols but still these have some problems which have been discussed in the next section. Energy efficiency can also be achieved by sensible flooding at the route discovery process in reverse reactive protocols [1 A n d e n e r gy e f f i c i e n c y  r o ut i ng c a n  a l s o b e  achieved by using efficient metric for route selection such as cost function, node energy, battery level etc It presents a performance comparison of three well-known routing protocols in MANET, based on the result analysis obtained by running simulations with different scenarios in Network Simulator [1, 5   T h e c o mp a r is o n w a s d o n e b a s e d  o n  the parameters, number of sources in the network, duration of pause times, maximum movement speed and sending rate to evaluate the Packet Delivery Ratio \(PDR\, Normalized Routing Load \(NRL\nd average end to end delay To summarize, this paper is organized in 7 sections where Section 2 briefly describes routing protocols in MANET.

II ROUTING PROTOCOL IN MANET Routing Protocol is used to find suitable routes between communicating nodes. They do not have use any access points to connect to other nodes. Routing protocols can be generally classified into 3 categories:-Centralized versus Distributed,Static versus Adaptive, and Reactive versus Proactive [6 7   A Proactive Protocols Proactive protocols are called table driven protocols in which the route to all the nodes is maintained in routing table Packets are transferred over the predefined route specified in the direction-finding table. In this scheme, the packet forwarding is done faster but the routing overhead is greater because all the routes have to be distinct before transferring the packets. Proactive protocols have lower latency because all the routes are maintained at all the times. For Example DSDV, OLSR, WRP CGSR, TBRPF [6 7  B Reactive \(On-Demand \ Routing Protocols In this group of protocol there is an initialization of a route discovery mechanism by the source node to find the route to the destination node when the source node has data packets to send. When a route is found, the route preservation is initiated to maintain this route until it is no longer required or the destination is not reachable. The benefit of these protocols is that overhead messaging is reduced. One of the disadvantages of these protocols is the delay in discovering a new route. The different types of reactive routing protocols are Dynamic Source Routing \(DSR\ Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector routing \(AODV\, and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm TORA\ [7, 13  C Hybrid  Routing Protocols A hybrid protocol means the combinations of reactive and proactive protocols and takes advantages of these two protocols and as a result, routes are found quickly in the routing zone. Example Protocol: ZRP III REVIEW OF EXISTING ROUTING PROTOCOLS In this section, we have brief review of the routing operations performed by the familiar protocols. DSDV AODV, TORA, EAODV and DSR are discussed A Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing \(AODV Protocol The Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing \(AODV protocol is a reactive routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks [8  W h i l e  a  r e a c t i v e r o u t i n g p r o t o c o l  AODV o n l y  needs to maintain the routing information about the active paths. In AODV, the routing information is upholder in the routing tables at all the nodes. Every mobile node maintains a next hop routing table, which contains the destinations to which it currently has a route. In AODV, when a source node desires to send packets to the destination but no route is available, it initiates a route discovery process In the route discovery process, the source node broadcasts route request \(RREQ\ packets which includes Destination Sequence Number. When the destination or a node that has a route to the destination receives the RREQ, it checks the destination sequence numbers it currently knows and the one particular in the RREQ. To assurance the freshness of the routing information, a route reply \(RREP\ packet is created and forwarded back to the source node only if the destination sequence number is equal to or greater than the one specified in RREQ. It uses only symmetric links and a RREP follows the reverse path of the respective RREQ. Upon receiving the RREP packet, each intermediate node along the route information updates its next-hop table entries with respect to the destination node B Dynamic Source Routing \(DSR\ Protocol Dynamic Source Routing \(DSR\ protocol [9 10 and 15 i s  a  reactive routing, on demand routing protocol based on the source routing. The source routing unimportantly allows routing of packets to be loop-free,it avoids the need for up-todate routing information between different nodes and allows nodes that overhear packets containing routes to store this information for their own future use. A node that needs to send a packet to a destination checks in its route store if it has a route available. In a route discovery stage, a node sends the route request to the destination node. It reacts by the route reply than a path is established between the source and destination. Route maintenance phase , it indicates that the source route is broken; it can favor another route to reach the destination C Distance Sequence Distance Vector \(DSDV\ Protocol Destination Sequence Distance Vector \(DSDV\ is a proactive routing protocol and it is based on the distance vector algorithm. In table-driven routing protocols, each node constantly maintains up-to-date routes to every other node in the network. Routing information is periodically transmitted during the network in regulate to maintain routing table consistency. The routing table is updated at each node by finding the modify in routing information about all the available destinations with the number of nodes to that particular destination. As well, to provide loop freedom DSDV uses sequence numbers, which is provided, by the destination node. In case, if a route has already existed before traffic arrives, transmission occurs with no delay. In case of failure of a route to the next node, the node instantly updates the sequence number and broadcasts the information to its neighbors. When a node receives routing information then it ensures in its routing table. If it does not find such entry into the routing table then bring up to dates the routing table with routing information it has found. In case, if the node finds that it has already entry into its routing table then it compares with the sequence number of the received information with the routing table entry and updates the information [11  307 


D Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm \(TORA Protocol The Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm \(TORA\ is a highly adaptive, well-organized and scalable distributed routing algorithm based on the thought of link reversal [1  TORA is proposed for highly self-motivated mobile, multihop wireless networks. It is a source-initiated on-demand routing protocol. It finds multiple routes from a source node to a destination node. The main characteristic of TORA is that the control messages are restricted to small set of nodes in the neighborhood of the occurrence of a topological change. To attain this, the nodes maintain routing information about adjacent nodes. The protocol has three basic functions Route creation  Route maintenance and Route removal TORA can undergo from unbounded worst-case convergence time for very stressful scenarios. TORA has a single feature of maintaining multiple routes to the destination so that topological changes do not require any reaction at all. The protocol responds only when all routes to the destination are lost  IV PROBLEM STATEMENT A Energy issues in Mobile  Ad-hoc networks Ad-hoc networks have to suffer many challenges at the time of routing process. Dynamically changing topology and no unified infrastructure are the biggest challenges in the designing of an Ad hoc network.  If we compare it to the wired system then wireless network has less and more varying bandwidth, so bandwidth efficiency is also a major concern in Ad-hoc network routing protocols. It has Limited power supply is the biggest challenge of an Ad-hoc network so if we want to increase the network lifetime \(time duration when the first node of the network runs out of power\ as well the node lifetime then we must have an efficient energy organization protocol [18  A s  a  r e s u l t a n A d h o c r o ut i n g p r o t o c o l m u s t  meet all these challenges to give the average performance in every case B Energy Efficiency In Mobile ad hoc network, all the devices generally operate on battery seek to track the energy efficiency heuristically by the reducing energy they have consumed, whereas maintaining suitable performance of certain works. Using the power consumption is not only a single decisive factor for deciding energy efficiency. In fact, energy efficiency be able to measured by the duration of the specific time over which the network can have maintain a certain performance stage, which is known as the network lifetime. Therefore routing information to increasing the lifetime of the certain network level is different from the lowest amount energy routing Lowest amount energy routes [12 f r o m  ti me  to t ime a t t r a c t  more flows, and the nodes in these routes enervate out their energy very soon; thus the whole network canít perform any job due to the failure on these nodes. In the other words, the total energy consumed is balanced consumed along with all nodes in the networks. In general routing with highest lifetime stability all the routes and nodes globally maintain in consequence that the network performance level for a longer lifetime. Hence, energy efficiency is not only measured by the power consumption but in more common it can be measured by the duration of time over which the network can preserve a assured performance level V SIMULATION PARAMETERS  A Mobility Mobility model uses a random waypoint model in a rectangular field TABLE 1 SIMULATION PARAMETERS Parameters Values No. of Nodes 50 Simulation Duration 1000 Seconds Environment Size 1500 x 1500 m2 Maximum Movement Node Speed 10,20,30,40,50 m/sec Pause Time 0,10,20,40,100 sec Packet Size 512 bytes Packet Sending rate 20,60,100,150,200 Routing Protocols EAOADV,AODV,DSR,DSDV,TORA OLSR Traffic Type CBR MAC Type MAC 802.11 Simulation Tool NS2-2.34 Mobility Model Random  Way Point In addition, in order to examine the impact of movement speed on performances of routing protocols, we varied the maximum movement speed, while value of pause time and sending rate was kept unchanged. In that case, values of maximum movement speed range from 10 to 50 m/s, while pause time duration is 0 simulation seconds, and sending rate is 100 kbps B Performance Metrics I Packet Delivery Ratio PDR\: PDR shows how successful a protocol is in delivering packets from source to destination in a network II Average End to End delay This is the average end to end delay of all successfully transmitted data packets from source to destination in a network III Normalized Routing Load NRL\ NRL is the ratio of the number of routing packets transmitted in a network VI RESULTS AND ANALYSIS In this section the comparison has done for the success rate and the energy consumption for the three routing algorithms over a wide variety of scenarios and traffic models resulting varying one of the three selected parameters i.e. node velocity packet sending rate and pause time 6.1 Effect of PDR versus varying pause time, movement speed, sending rate 308 


Obtained effects show characteristic differences in performance between considered routing protocols, which are the consequence of various mechanisms on which protocols are based. Although we carried out simulations with 10, 20 and 30 sources, only results with 20 sources are presented in this paper As in [1   o n demandî routing protocols EAODV, AODV and DSR, attain high values of PDR, which means they are efficient protocols from the point of delivering packets to their destination \(Fig.1,Fig.2 and Fig.3\. For EAODV, AODV and DSR protocols, PDR is self-governing of mobility and number of sources, while DSDV has approximately the same PDR under low mobility. Since DSDV protocol uses a ìtable drivenî approach of maintaining routing information, it isnít adaptive to the route changes that occur under high mobility as EAODV, AODV and DSR protocols are. As a result, DSDV and TORA protocol is not suitable for MANETs, because it is slow. Results obtained by running simulations with a changeable sending rate confirm the previous conclusion, but also show that all routing protocols don t perform well when packet delivery ratio increases with respect to network load Fig.1. Packet Delivery Ratio for Pause time Fig.2. Packet Delivery Ratio for Maximum movement speed Fig.3. Packet Delivery Ratio for sending rate 6.2 Effect of Network Load versus varying pause time movement speed, sending rate  On the other hand, in all considered cases, regardless of mobility, source number or network load, DSR and TORA protocol generates significantly less routing load than EAODV, AODV and DSDV protocols as Fig. 4, Fig.5 and Fig.6 shows. In high network load cases, nodes using considered routing protocols send more packets, thereby sending a larger number of routing packets On the other hand, in high mobility cases, connection failures happen very often. Link failures initiate route discoveries in EAODV, AODV, since nodes have only one route per destination in their routing table. Thus, the frequency of route discovery in EAODV and AODV is straight comparative to the number of link failures. That is the reason why a major contribution to E AODVís routing overhead comes from RREQ packets. On the other hand, reaction of DSR to connection failures in link is mild and sources route discoveries less often. The reason is plenty of cached routes at each node and prolongation of route discovery until all cached routes fail. That is the reason why RREQ packets donít contribute so much to DSRís routing overhead. A large contribution in DSR comes from RREP packets t he node s speed was chosen in the range 1-20 m/s and the packet send rate was gradually increased from 10 packets/s to 100 packets/s and the other parameters remain the same as in the previous experiments. All algorithms are able to cope up with an increased load \(see Fig.4\, however, the performance of E AODV is the worst for packet delivery ratio and DSDV TORA and DSR has similar packet delivery ratio. Fig. 6 shows the effect of increasing the sending rate. This effect is analogous to the effect of increasing the number of source. All protocols present quite a steady behavior, the DSDV protocol merit to its table driven scheme, while on demand protocols thanks to their property of learning route information from previous packets.DSR shows lower value of routing load than EAODV and DSDV  309 


Fig. 4 Normalized Routing Load for: a. Pause time Fig.5. Normalized Routing Load for Maximum movement speed Fig.6. Normalized Routing Load for sending rate 6.3 Effect of Average end to end delay versus varying pause time, movement speed, sending rate  Analyzing average end to end delay, we come to the end that DSR routing protocol out performs EAODV and DSDV protocols \(Fig.7, Fig.8 and Fig.9\, unlike the results acquired in [1  w h e r e  E AODV p r o t o c o l  h a s t h e b e st p e r f o r m a n c e s  A s supposed previously, for any network topology change, nodes that use EAODV protocol have to send RREQ packets. In other words, a route discovery process has been to be activated, because EAODV is a routing protocol that has no available route when needed Since of inefficient route maintenance, average end to end delay is the largest for EAODV. On the other hand, DSDV and TORA protocol proactively holds routes to all destinations in its table regardless of topology changes. However, DSR protocol has the best performances, because it doesnít depend on periodical activities, and it uses source routing and route caching, but also maintains multiple routes per destination. It excels especially in low mobility scenarios, which means that in cases when network topology is stable, routes are not stale and that results in the best performances under consideration  Fig.7. Average End to End Delay for: a. Pause time Fig.8. Average End to End Delay for Maximum movement speed 310 


Fig.9. Average End to End Delay for sending rate When a network contains a small number of sources or nodeís sending rate is low, EAODV and DSDV protocols have a similar average end to end delay as DSR, especially when node mobility is low. In that case, the network is less loaded However, with source number or sending rate increasing network load is increasing, and average end to end delay for all three protocols, especially E AODV and DSDV, becomes larger 6.4 Effect of Energy Consumption versus varying pause time, movement speed, sending rate  The energy consumption of the on-demand protocols increases as the maximum motion speed grows. As the movement speed moves from a humans walking MANET scenario to a road cars MANET, the DSR has lower energy per user data than EAODV and DSDV. When speed grows DSR performs better than EAODV, TORA and DSDV The performance of EAODV is the worst for packet delivery ratio and DSDV, TORA and DSR has similar packet delivery ratio Fig. 12 shows the effect of increasing the sending rate. This effect is analogous to the effect of increasing the number of source Fig.10 Energy Consumption for Pause time Fig.11 Energy Consumption for Maximum movement speed Fig.12 Energy Consumption for Packet Sending rate All protocols present quite a stable behavior; some protocols are proactive and reactive scheme, while on demand protocols route information from preceding packets. DSR shows lower value of energy consumption than EAODV, TORA and DSDV On average on-demand protocols \(DSR, EAODV, and TORA present an energy descendent trend as the motion rate drops, the table-driven protocol \(DSDV\ presents an energy consumption that remains practically constant as packet sending rate varies CONCLUSIONS Routing protocol DSDV uses proactive ìtable drivenî routing while EAODV AODV, TORA and DSR use ondemand routing. DSDV protocol periodically updates its routing tables even in cases when network topology doesnít modify EAODV protocol has inefficient route maintenance, because it has to initiate a route discovery process every time network topology changes. Both protocols, EAODV, TORA, AODV and DSR use route discovery process, but with different routing mechanisms. In particular, EAODV and AODV protocol uses routing information into the tables, it use one route per each destination, and destination sequence numbers as a mechanism for determining freshness of routes and route loops prevention 311 


On the other hand, DSR uses source routing and route caching and doesnít have depended on any periodic or time-based operations. In general, we can conclude that in low mobility and low load scenarios, all the protocols react in a similar way while with mobility or load increasing DSR outperforms EAODV, AODV, TORA and DSDV routing protocols. Poor performances of TORA and DSR routing protocol, when mobility or load are increased, are the consequence of forceful use of caching and the lack of any system to expire out of date routes or establish the freshness of routes when several choices are available in the network. A central face is the development of the dynamic routing protocol that can efficiently and finds routes between two communication nodes. As well, in order to analyze and improve existing or new MANET routing protocols, it is desirable to examine other metrics like power consumption, fault tolerance, number of hops, jitter, etc. in various mobility and traffic models R EFERENCES 1 S.Shah,et al,î Performance Evaluation of Ad Hoc Routing Protocols Using NS2 Simulation,î Proceeding of the National Conference on Mobile and pervasive Computing \( CoMPC-2008\,Chennai,India,August 2008 2 S  Do sh i  T  X Bro wn  M i n i m u m E n e r g y R o u t i n g  sc h e m e s i n W i re l e ss Ad hoc networks, IEEE INFOCOM 2002 3 C  Y u  B   L e e a n d H  Y  Y o u n  E n er gy E f f i ci e n t  R o u t i n g Pr ot o c ol s  f o r  Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, Cleveland State University, EFFRD Grant No. 0210-0630-10 4 K.Gorantala,î Routing Protocols in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,î Master Thesis, Department of Computing Science, Umeoa University, Sweden June 2006 5 G  G i r l i n g J  L i  K a m W a  P  O s bor n  R   St e f a n o v a  T h e D e s i g n a n d  Implementation of a Low Power Ad Hoc Protocol Stack, IEEE Personal Communications, 2000 6 R.V.Biradar, V.C.Patil, Dr. S.Sawant, and Dr.R.R.Mudholkar Classification and comparison of routing protocols in wireless sensor networksî, UbiCC Jou rnal, Vol.4 7 E   A l t m a n a n d T  J i me n e z L e ct u r e N o t e s o n N S  S i mu l a t o r  f o r  Beginners, December 03, 2003 8 C  E  P e rk i n s a n d  E  M  R o y e r  Ad  h o c On De m a n d Di s t a n c e  V e c t o r  AODV\ Routing \(Internetdraft\ in: Mobile Ad-hoc Network \(MANET Working Group, IETF \(1998 9 S  B ar akov i e a n d J  B a r a kov i e   C o m p ar at i v e  Pe r f or m a nce E v al uat i o n of  Mobile Ad Hoc Routing Protocols,î Proceedings of  33 rd international Convention on Information and Communication Technology Electronics and Microelectronics \(MIPRO 2010\, Opatija, Croatia, May 2010 10 T C a m p  J  Bo le n g  B   W i l l i a m s  L W ilc o x  a n d  W  N a v i d i  Performance Comparison of Two Location-based Routing Protocols for Ad hoc Networks, Proceedings of the IEEE INFOCOM Conference, pp 1678-1687, 2002 11 O  Ta r i q   F  G r e g   W   M u r r a y  O n  th e Ef f e c t  o f Tr a f f i c  M o d e l to th e  Performance Evaluation of Multicast Protocols in MANET, Proceedings of the Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering pp. 404  407, 2005  J  E  W i es e l t h i e r  G  D  N g uye n a n d A  E p h r em i d es   R e s o ur c e  Management in Energy-limited, Bandwidth-limited, Transceiver-limited Wireless Networks for Session-based Multicasting  International Journal of Computer and Telecommunications Networking, vol. 39, no. 2, pp 113-131, June 2002 13 M G e r l a  S  J   L e e  W  Su  O n D e m a n d Mu l t i c a s t R o u t i n g Pr ot oc ol  ODMRP\r Ad-hoc Networks,Internet draft, draft-ietf-manet-odmrp02.txt, 2000 14 M  Mo ha m m e d  E n e r g y E f f i ci en t L o ca t i o n A i d e d R o u t i ng Pr ot oc ol  f o r  Wireless MANETs, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, vol. 4, no. 1 & 2, 2009  D  B  J o hns o n a n d D  A   M a l t z  D y n a m i c So ur ce R o ut i n g i n  A d H o c Wireless Networks \(Kluwer Academic, 1996 16 D  J o hn s o n D  A   Ma l t z a n d J   B r o c h  T h e D yna mi c Sou r c e R o u t i n g  Protocol for Mobile Ad hoc Networks \(Internet-draft\, in: Mobile Ad hoc Network \(MANET\ Working Group, IETF \(1998 17 V  R i s h i w a l  M  Ya d a v   S   Ve r m a  S   K Ba j a p a i   P o we r Aw a r e R o u t i n g  in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 101-109, October 2009 18 M  M a l e k i a n d M   P e d r a m  Li fe ti m e A w a r e M u lt ic a s t R o u t i n g  in  Wireless Ad hoc Networks, Proceedings of IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2004  E  W i es e l t h i e r  G  D  N g uye n and  A  E p h r e m i d es  E n e r gy E f f i ci en t  Broadcast and Multicast Trees in Wireless Networks, Mobile Networks and Applications \(MONET\, vol. 7, no. 6, pp. 481-492, December 2002 312

shown in Figure 11 The X-axis is the percentage of the normal completion time of Query 5 when a failure is injected Firstly it is not surprised that ParaLite is about twice faster than Hive One reason for the superiority is that not all the operators are checkpointed in ParaLite Moreover Hive uses sort-join while ParaLite uses hash-join In addition the start-up overhead for Hadoop cannot be ignored Hive uses 3 MapReduce jobs to express the query and each takes 10 15 seconds before all map tasks are started Secondly the slowdown for both system are similar However the slowdonw of Hadoop is limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability

necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a similar effectiveness R EFERENCES  D DeW itt and J Gray   P arallel Database Systems the Future of Highperformance Database Systems Commun  vol 35 no 6 pp 85Ö98 1992  J Dean and S Ghema w at MapReduce

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
