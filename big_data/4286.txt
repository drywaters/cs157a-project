255 23th Conference Radioelektronika 2013, April 16-17, Pardubice, Czech Republic Astronomical Image Denoising using Curvelet and Starlet Transform  Elena Anisimova, Jan Bedn Pe tr P ta FEE CTU in Prague Department of Radioelectronics Prague, Czech Republic anisiele@fel.cvut.cz   Abstract 227Astronomical image data acquisition under low light conditions causes higher noise occurrence in these data. There are a lot of noise sources including also the thermally generated noise \(dark current\side used astronomical CCD sensor and the Poisson noise of the photon flux. There are specific image quality criteria in astronomy. These criteria are derived from the algorithms for astronomical image processing and are specific in 
the field of multimedia signal processing. Astrometric and photometric algorithms provide information about stellar objects: their brightness profile \(PSF\ position and magnitude They could fail because of lower SNR. This problem can be solved by subtraction a dark frame from a captured image nowadays. However, this method couldn't work properly in systems with shorter shutter speed and nonlinear sensitivity, such as for example the system MAIA \(Meteor Automatic Imager and Analyser\ Image data from these system could not been processed by conventional algorithms. Denoising of the astronomical images is therefore still a big challenge for astronomers and people who process astronomical data Therefore usage of other denoising algorithms is proposed in this 
paper. We describe our experiences with astronomical image data denoising based on Curvelet and Starlet transform. Novel algorithms have been tested on image data from MAIA system Their influence on important photometric data like stellar magnitude and FWHM \(Full Width at Half Maximum\ has been studied and compared with conventional denoising methods Keywords\227image denoising, astronomy, curvelet transform starlet transform, MAIA I  I NTRODUCTION  Many discrete wavelet transform algorithms have been recently developed [1  Th e m o s t  w i del y k n o w n  on e i s  certainly the orthogonal transform, proposed by Mallat [3 a n d 
its bi-orthogonal version [4 s i ng t h e or t h o g o n a l w a ve l e t  transform, digital signal s can be decomposed as follows  where and are respectively the scaling function and the wavelet function J is the number of resolutions used in the decomposition w j are the wavelet \(or detail\ coefficients at scale j  c J is a coarse or smooth version of the original signal s k represents time axis and l is a time shift. Thus, the algorithm outputs J 1 subband arrays. The indexing is such that 
j 1 corresponds to the finest scale \(high frequencies While the bi-orthogonal wavelet transform leads to successful implementation in image compression techniques results are not convenient for data analysis \(e.g., denoising deconvolution, object detection\. This is mainly due to the loss of the translation-invariance property in the discrete wavelet transform \(DWT\ realized by the Mallat algorithm [1  l e a d i n g  to a large number of artifacts when an image is reconstructed after modification of its wavelet coefficients For this reason, astronomers and physicists have generally preferred to work with the continuous wavelet transform, even if the cost to be paid is a considerable amount of redundancy in 
the transformation and there is no reconstruction operator [5 For some application, such as fractal analysis or object detection, these drawbacks have no impact because there is no need to apply a reconstruction. For other applications, in which reconstruction is needed, some researchers have chosen an undecimated version of the wavelet transform implemented by a very efficient way using so called \300 trous algorithm [5 where this French term means \223with holes\224. This kind of the isotropic undecimated wavelet transform is also called the Starlet transform [7  A series of recent papers [8,9  h o w e v e r  arg u e d  th a t  wavelets and related classical multiresolution ideas deal with a 
limited dictionary made up of roughly isotropic elements occurring at all scales and locations. Moreover, these dictionaries do not exhibit highly anisotropic elements \(e.g curves and edges\. Following on this topic, Cand\350s and Donoho introduced new multiscale systems like curvelets [7  and ridgelets [8 C u rv ele t s  an d r i dg elets  tak e th e f o rm of b a s e  elements which exhibit very high directional sensitivity and are highly anisotropic. In two-dimensions, for instance, curvelets are localized along curves, in three dimensions along sheets etc II M ETHODS USED FOR IMAGE DENOISING  As was mentioned above, two methods the curvelet 
transform and the starlet transform were used for image denoising. First, we would like shortly to describe some important properties of these transforms and algorithms for their realization. After that, we will introduce applied s l  c J,k J,l k   j,l k w j,k J j=1 k k   1

Therefore, the novel denoising methods are proposed  IV A STRONOMICAL IMAGE DENOISING  A Conventional algorithm in astronomy Denoising of captured astronomical images is generally performed by subtracting so called dark frame from these data Dark frame is an image acquired with the sensor in the dark when the input aperture is closed\ essentially just an image of noise inside the image sensor. This noise consists almost of the thermally generated noise inside the CCD sensor   Figure 3 MAIA system design  Another image called flat field could be used in addition to the dark frame. Noise suppression is not a general purpose of acquired image, flat field is used to correct pixel-to-pixel variations in the CCD response as well as any nonuniform illumination of the detector itself.  In our case, we will divide the captured image by the normalized  flat field to avoid the microchannel structure of the image intensifier However, the collection of dark frame and flat field couldn't work properly in systems with shorter shutter speed and nonlinear sensitivity, such is our system MAIA. Denoising methods based on starlet and curvelet transform were therefore tested B Denoising using Starlet and Curvelet transform The way to remove noise from image data is to perform the thresholding of starlet or curvelet coefficients of the processed image after corresponding transform. Thresholding is a method which determines significance of the coefficients. If appropriate coefficient is larger than a threshold, it is significant, otherwise it is not Let us see on the hard coefficients thresholding. Let suppose, that CCD sensor receives more than 40 photons during image acquisition, thus the Poisson noise distribution accumulate inside the sensor be comes almost indistinguishable from the Gaussian [1  G i v e n st a t i o nar y G a ussi a n no i s e  i t  suffices to compare the wavelet coefficients w j,l  j 226 decomposition level l 226 index of pixel\ to the Gaussian noise standard deviation j   Often k is chosen as 3 because of empirical rule which states that for a normal distribution, nearly all values \(about 99.7%\ lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. If w j,l is small, it is not significant and could be due to noise. If w j,l is large, it is significant and is due to the useful signal So, it is necessary to estimate, in the case of Gaussian noise models, the noise standard deviation at each decomposition scale j The appropriate value of j in the succession of the starlet or curvelet is assessed from the standard deviation of the noise s in the original data s and from study of the noise in the starlet / curvelet space. This study consists of simulating a data set containing Gaussian noise with a standard deviation equal to 1, and taking the starlet / curvelet transform of this data set    T he n t h e  s t a n d a r d de vi a t i o n e j is computed at each decomposition level. Due to the properties of the multiresolution approach, the noise standard deviation at scale j  of the data is equal to the noise standard deviation of the original image s multiplied by the noise standard deviation at scale j of the simulated data j  s  e j Table I gives the e j  values for the 2D starlet transform using the cubic B3 spline scaling filte    TABLE I D EPENDENCE OF SIMULATED G AUSSIAN NOISE STANDARD DEVIATION ON DECOMPOSITION LEVEL  Decomposition level j  1 2 3 4 5 2D image 0.889 0.200 0.086 0.041 0.020  w j,l  0 if w j,l k j w j,l  if w j,l k j  3

Shutter speed used in MAIA system is 1/60 s which is a very short period of time. Longer exposure times however could not be used because the main purpose of the MAIA system is to precisely record trajectory of meteor\222s fall, which could take just fraction of second There is image processing using the starlet transform left Its denoising properties are better than in case of dark frame subtraction method and worse than in case of the curvelet transform. Nevertheless, if we look at the Tab. III, we can affirm that the Starlet transform damages scientific astronomical data least than other two techniques.  Magnitude and FWHM deviations of almost all selected stellar objects are within the allowed range \(1 for FWHM and 0.3 for magnitude Artifacts caused by starlet coefficients thresholding are not as strong as artifacts contained in reconstructed image after curvelet transform denoising \(Fig. 6\.  Thus, the Starlet transform is the most suitable method for noise suppression in astronomical images acquired by our nonlinear system with shorter shutter speed A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work has been supported by the project of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic No. 205/09/1302 \223Study of sporadic meteors and weak meteor showers using automatic video intensifiers cameras\224 and by the project of the Student grant agency of the Czech Technical University in Prague SGS13/212/OHK3/3T/13 \223Advanced Algorithms for Processing and Analysis of Scientific Image Data\224 Authors would like to thank Pavel Koten from Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic and Stanislav V\355tek from FEE CTU in Prague for supply of the testing videos from MAIA system and their conversion into appropriate video format   a\ \(b\ \(c\ \(d Figure 6 Original image without noise \(a\, noised image \(b\ which almost corresponds to denoised image after dark frame subtraction, den oised  image using the starlet transform \(c\ and the curvelet transform \(d R EFERENCES   S.

Furthermore, in the datasets which only knows the number of groups, the Calinski-Harabazs and Davies-Boulin index with the real number of groups can be used to determine which the largest quality clustering, thus is finding the corresponding \003 value for that clustering. From both index have a growing trend, the clustering analysis based on both allows finding more reliable clustering of better quality As for the datasets that lack of any information describing the actual grouping, both indexes are used again to define the quality VI C ONCLUSIONS  In this article we checked some of the most used cluster validation index to determine the clustering quality. This quality was analyzed based on the result of all the indexes, to know its quality and finally which of them quantifies the actual, being the F-measure the one that offers the most reliable results. The results presented correspond to those obtained from the clustering step of the methodology presented in [2 s o  d etai le d p r es en ta ti on an d an aly s is   The clustering result is quite close to the expected and through this analysis can be seen that for these datasets an optimal \003 value can be specified as follows: 0.1 < \003 <= 0.2 Consequently, for determining the quality of clustering in datasets with information about the real grouping, the Fmeasure gives the clearest value about the quality of the clustering result. As seen in the case of datasets with lack of information no index is the best, and then both are used The Future lines for this issue are oriented to the proposal to implement different validation index and analyze their behavior, as well as work with other datasets to parse through the index an optimal \003 value, and compare if is the same as in this paper A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank to the Instituto TecnolÛgico de Toluca and also acknowledge the PROMEP/103.5/12/4783 project for their financial support R EFERENCES  1

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
