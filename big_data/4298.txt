INTRODUCTION  Palmprints share many of the discriminative feature s with fingerprints however they posses larger skin area a nd therefore provide more features to be analyzed Pal mprint recognition is widely used in biometric application s, such as access control and because about 30 of the latents  recovered from crime scenes are from palms they ar e also used in forensics [1    Visible palmprint details can be subdivided into tw o groups big details like ridge flow direction and crease and small details, like individual ridges, valleys, minutiae points \(ridge endings and splits islands and even pores on the ridges Fig. 1\ [2    In this work we concentrate on the visible small pa lmprint details ñ individual ridges and their tracking Since palmprint ridges appear in images as lines th at are darker than the surrounding valleys line detection  algorithms may be used to extract them State of th e art techniques incorporate enhancement of the image qua lity by phase congruency [3   i m a g e  p r o c e s s i n g  w i t h  e d g e  d e tection methods and conversion into binary representation b y thresholding the pixel intensities 4   O t h e r  a d v a n ced palmprint image processing techniques involve wavel ets [5   Zernike moments [6  a n d  P h a s e O n l y  C o r r e l a t i o n   7      Figure 1. The principal lines, ridges, and minutiae in palmprint [2   Since the images usually are distorted simple regi on growing algorithm for ridge tracking cannot be used  therefore information of several adjacent ridges b ecomes useful Also other palmprint details like crease  usually appear one by one, not in groups of parallel lines therefore they can be distinguished from ridges The cross section of several adjacent ridges form a pattern of repeating minimums and maximums that can be approximated with harmonic functions like sine wav e 8   Therefore, the transforms, based on these functions such as 2D Fourier and Wavelet transforms 5   a s  w e l l  a s  f ilters derived from them, such as Gabor filters [9   m a y  b e used to clear the unwanted noises In this research we extend the idea of Non-Halo Com plex Matched Filtering NH-CMF from 10   t h e r e f o r e   f o r increased clarity this method is described in deta ils in the 978-1-4673-4989-5/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 


next two sections. Then we present our modification s to the method and discuss the acquired results    2. RELATED WORK  Complex Matched Filtering algorithm was introduced in 11   B e i n g  d e v e l o p e d  f o r  p a l m  v e i n  i m a g e  p r o c e s s i n g in biometrics 12   i t  s h o w e d  a  s i m p l e  a p p r o a c h  f o r  e x traction of line-like objects LLO such as lines and edges  of arbitrary directions and even scales latter depend s on the kernel parameters The approach was based on match ed filtering and mainly presented the method of combin ing several matched filtering results into one using c omplex coefficients The result of CMF is a matrix of vectors   y x v    further called as an ìoutput imageî\, which has the same di mensions as the input image   y x f  Each output vector   y x v   is assigned to the corresponding pixel of the input im age   y x f  Magnitude of the acquired vector   y x v   shows how similar is the pixel's neighborhood to the LLO and the angle of this vector     y x v Arg    shows the direction of found LLO Therefore not only the LLO's are extrac ted during CMF but also the image is prepared for the segmentation e g contour tracking procedure An gular information provided by the CMF in the each image pixel points in the direction where the next pixel of the same LLO most probably will appear Thus the line/contour t racking task is simplified However, in its initial form, the CMF had a disadva ntage of producing the Halo Artifact  false vectors around the extracted regions. In [10   t h i s  p r o b l e m  w a s  i n v e s t igated, the CMF method was improved and the Halo artifact appearance was eliminated. The Non-Halo CMF \(NH-CMF  showed a performance that is visually comparable to  the result of matched filtering while still providing the additional information about LLO direction  3. NON-HALO COMPLEX MATCHED FILTERING  Consider the input image   y x f   and the line detection matched filter kernel   n y x M j   which can be rotated to arbitrary angle of p j   N n n   1 where N  is total count of used angles and n   0 N 1 Figure 2 shows the rotated kernel which is used in  this experiment \(left\, compared to the ridge pattern it supposed to match \(right The cross-correlation value   n n y x s j   0 0  of this kernel placed with its center in pixel   0 0  y x with the underlying image region is defined by the following equation  Figure 2. Filter kernel and ridge pattern to extrac t             D n n n y y x x M y x f y x s j j      0 0 0 0       2 The summation of values is accomplished within the kernel boundaries D  for variables x  and y  To process the image according to the CMF or NH-CMF algorithm it is fir st necessary to correlate the image with all possible rotated kernels acquiring matched filtering values   n n y x s j   0 0  for each n  and in each image pixel   0 0  y x  Each of the N  values shows the similarity between the image regio n around   0 0  y x and the kernel. This feature was exploited in [10 to prevent filter from processing negative values of c orrelation which results in a Halo Artifact production and will be exploited in this work for the other purpose The Halo Artifact is removed by eliminating any neg ative values of correlation from further processing       2       n n n n n n y x s y x s y x c j j j    3 The algorithm continues with the doubled angle assi gnment and summation, which can be expressed in form        n j n n n e y x c y x c j j 2      4 and, finally, the angle decrement         y x c Arg j e y x c y x v  5.0          5  The acquired vectors smoothly follow the direction of the detected ridges as shown in Figure 3 up but thi s is not always the case More frequently the palmprint images which are us ed as forensic evidence contain the ridge structure, tha t is hardly noticeable and is covered with noise artifacts or crease of other direction In this case the NH-CMF becomes us eless because it is aimed to detect individual lines not  a set of overlapping lines \(Figure 3 \(down The possible application of NH-CMF in ridge trackin g task in the field of forensics makes it an interesting c hallenge to adapt this algorithm to handle images where differ ently oriented lines ridges and crease are overlapped but must be detected separately 


 Figure 3. NH-CMF result for different palmprint are as: with clear ridge structure up and overlapped with crease  a problematic area \(down   4. DETECTION AND SEPARATION OF THE OVERLAPPING LINES  In the case of overlapping lines NH-CMF detects al l of them scattered around the image region Therefore statistical approaches can be used to analyze their  significance and directions For this task we use m agnitude weighted angle histogram MWAH Suppose having a s et of I vectors I i v i  1    where I is the pixel count in the analyzed image region. Let i v  be the magnitude of vectors and     i v Arg   be the floored angle in degrees The magnitude weighted angle histogram h  can then be defined by the following equation            k v Arg i i i v k h      6 where k  is the analyzed angle in degrees k 0Ö179 Thus we ensure that the vectors that have longest magnit ude have biggest impact on the calculated histogram values For non-problematic image regions where clear patt ern of similarly oriented ridges is present, the MWAH will always show one dominating peak, denoting the ridge flow d irection Fig. 4 \(left\\. For problematic regions, the MWAH presents multiple peaks \(Fig. 4 \(right\\, each peak correspo nds to the different LLO being overlapped The analysis of MWA H peaks allows us to choose the preferred LLO directi on as well as to know the direction and proportion of the unwanted details We analyze MWAH for partially overlapping regions of 71x71 pixels chosen as a tradeoff betwe en computation speed and statistical precision of MWAH  Once the direction of interest j  x  y  is found in radians the detail rejection function r  j  can be formulated for example, as in \(7  Figure 4 MWAH for different type of image regions  clear ridge pattern with one direction left and problematic region with overlapping ridge and crease structures \(right             max max max 1 2 1   2 cos 1   r y x r r y x r     j j j j      7 where r max  is tunable unwanted detail rejection level e g 64  5. APPLIED ALGORITHM MODIFICATIONS  We leave matched filtering part of the NH-CMF algor ithm which is performed by 2 and 3 unchanged Since  the acquired values   n n y x c j    represent the image fragment match with the filter kernel, and we donít need the details of unwanted angles to be matched next thing we apply is the match rejection          n n n n n y x c y x r y x c j j j j           8  Further algorithm continues unchanged         n j n n n e y x c y x c j j 2         9         y x c Arg j e y x c y x v   5.0             10  The result is NH-CMF with angular preference  and the preferred angle is defined by value   y x   j for each pixel The processing of an image consists of two steps 1  The input image is processed with original NHCMF As a result the output image   y x v    is acquired and analyzed with MWAH The preferred angle   y x   j  for each image region is assigned, according to MWAH pe aks In our experiment the highest peakís angle was automatically chosen 2  The input image is processed again using the modified NH-CMF taking the angular preference into account 


 6. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The method described in this paper shows how incorporating the NH-CMF and MWAH it is possible to  improve the filtration result of a palmprint Figur e 5 shows the comparison of NH-CMF and proposed modified vers ion of NH-CMF with angular preference The output image    y x v    shows the improvement of filtration quality over t he original NH-CMF \(Fig. 5 \(middle\ over Fig. 5 \(left and Fig 5 right over Fig 3 down Using angular prefer ence we are able to fine-tune filter performance to detect only details of interest, and after refiltering the image, some details that were not seen after first filtration become visible However when dealing with images of such low quality it is important to be careful with image processing methods becaus e false detections may occur, which is unacceptable in fore nsics  7.

the çcost rate based strategyé and çlocal-optimisation based strategyé can smartly choose to store or delete the datasets in one cloud storage service \(as shown in Table I\, thereby largely reducing the cost rate for storing datasets with one cloud service provider. If more cloud storage services are available as shown in Figure 4, the simulation of çT-CSB algorithm with two additional storage servicesé demonstrates further reduction of the cost rate by taking bandwidth cost into account. Table I shows the number of datasets transferred and smartly stored in two representative cloud storage services with our T-CSB algorithm. Furthermore, how much cost can be reduced depends on the price of available storage services. In the simulation of çT-CSB algorithm with additional Haylix storageé, although some datasets are transferred to Haylix for storage \(as shown in Table I\, the cost rate only drops slightly comparing to the çlocal-optimisation based strategyé \(as shown in Figure 4\. This is because the price of Haylix is not much cheaper than Amazon S3 cloud. In contrast, in the simulation of T-CSB algorithm with additional Glacier storageé, our T-CSB algorithm significantly reduces the cost rate \(as shown in Figure 4\ by transferring datasets to Glacier 13 for storage \(as shown in Table I From the above simulation, we can see that for different price models of cloud storage services, our T-CSB algorithm can always store the datasets accordingly, even in the situation that the price difference is minor \(e.g. the simulation of çTCSB algorithm with additional Haylix storageé\. Hence our TCSB algorithm is very effective in reducing the cost \(i.e. costeffective\ for storing generated application datasets with multiple service providers in the cloud VI R ELATED W ORK  Today, research on scientific applications in the cloud becomes popular [1    30 Co m p ar i ng t o  t h e  traditional computing systems, e.g. cluster, grid and HPC systems, a cloud computing system has cost benefits in various aspects [4   Wi th A m azon c l ou ds  c o s t m ode l an d  BO I N C  volunteer computing middleware, the work in [1 an aly s es  th e cost benefits of cloud computing versus grid computing. The work by Deelman et al. [11 a l s o  a p p lies Am azon  cl ou ds   c o s t  model and demonstrates that cloud computing offers a costeffective way to deploy scientific applications. The work mentioned above mainly focuses on the comparison of cloud computing systems and the traditional distributed computing paradigms, which shows that applications running in the cloud have cost benefits. However, our work focuses on reducing cost for running application in the cloud This paper is mainly inspired by the research in the area of scheduling, in which much work focuses on reducing various costsé for applications [2 sy st e m s [3 1 o r d a t a ce ntr e networks T h e d i ffer e n c e i s t h a t  sc h e d u l i ng a i m s  at  improving resource utilisation whilst our work investigates the trade-off among computation, storage and bandwidth costs which is a unique issue in cloud computing due to the pay-asyou-go model. Another important foundation for our work is the research on data provenance. Due to the importance of data    13 Data stored in Glacier usually need 3 to 5 hours to become available when users retrieve them. As analysed in Section II.B, usersê delay tolerance is out of the scope of this paper. Hence we only focus on the cost in the simulation provenance in scientific applications, many works about recording data provenance of the system have been done [9   Recently, research on data provenance in cloud computing systems has also appeared M o r e spe c ific a lly  Ost e r w e il e t  al e s e n t ho w t o ge ner a t e a da ta  de r i v a t i o n g r ap h  fo r execution of a scientific workflow. Foster et al. [1 pr o p o s e  the concept of virtual data in the Chimera system, which enables the automatic regeneration of datasets when needed Our DDG is based on data provenance, which depicts the dependency relationships of all the generated datasets in the cloud. With DDG, we can manage where the datasets are stored or how to regenerate them As the trade-off among computation, storage and bandwidth is an important issue in the cloud, much research has already embarked on this issue to a certain extent. First plenty of research has been done with regard to the trade-off between computation and storage. The Nectar system [15 is  designed for automatic management of data and computation in data centres, where obsolete datasets are deleted and regenerated whenever reused in order to improve resource utilisation. In [11  De elm an et al  p r es en t th at st o r in g so m e  popular intermediate data can save the cost in comparison to always regenerating them from the input data. In [2 A d am s e t  al. propose a model to represent the trade-off of computation cost and storage cost. In [33   th e au th o r s  pr o p o s e th e C T T SP algorithm that can find the best trade-off between computation and storage in the cloud, based on which a highly cost-effective and practical strategy is developed for storing datasets with one cloud service provider [3  How e v e r th e a b ov e w o rk  di d n o t  consider bandwidth cost into the trade-off model. In [6 B a li g a  et al. investigate the trade-off among computation, storage and bandwidth in the infrastructure level of cloud systems, where reducing energy consumption is the main research goal. In [3   Agarwala et al. transform application data to certain formats and store them with different cloud services in order to reduce storage cost in the cloud, but data dependency and the option of data regeneration are not considered in their work. In this paper we propose the T-CSB algorithm which can find the best tradeoff among computation, storage and bandwidth costs for storing datasets of linear DDG in the cloud. This algorithm can be utilised for cost-effectively storing generated application datasets with multiple service providers in the cloud VII C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  In this paper, we have investigated the unique features of storing large volume of generated scientific datasets with multiple cloud service providers in the cloud. Towards achieving the cost-effectiveness, we have proposed a T-CSB Trade-off among Computation, Storage and Bandwidth algorithm to find the minimum cost storage strategy for datasets of linear DDG, which also represents the best trade-off among three key factors \(computation, storage and bandwidth for the cost of data storage in the cloud.  This algorithm can be utilised for cost-effectively storing generated application datasets with multiple service providers in the cloud. General simulations indicate that our T-CSB algorithm is very effective in reducing cost for cloud storage In our current work, we assume that the storage of one cloud service provider have a unified price. However, in the

real world, the price of cloud storage is different according to different usages. In the future, we will incorporate more complex pricing models in our datasets storage cost model Furthermore, methods for forecasting dataset usage frequency can be further studied, with which our T-CSB algorithm can be adapted to different types of applications more easily A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research work reported here is partly supported by Australian Research Council under DP110101340 and LP130100324, Shanghai Knowledge Service Platform Project No. ZF1213.
