User-Oriented Modelling of Scientific Workflows for High Frequency Event Data Analysis Aarthi Natarajan University of New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales, Australia 
aarthin@cse.unsw.edu.au Abstract 227 Whether it is research scientists in computational physics, astronomy, genomics or financial services, all these varying disciplines have been challenged by the analysis of Big Data.  They are all required to perform multi-step analysis tasks to turn this data into actionable insight, from which critical decisions can be made.   Two data processing models that have rapidly evolved in the past decade to support data analysts are Complex Event Processing and Scientific Workflows.  Our 
research proposes a hybrid approach, which extends scientific workflows, to incorporate the handling of event-streams.  This model not only aims to provide a more efficient approach to analysing high frequency event streams, but also facilitates conceptual modelling of processes - to enable domain experts to build abstract, exploratory analysis processes in a user-friendly manner without the concerns of underlying technology, and transparently maps them to concrete solutions at run-time I  I NTRODUCTION  Today, many areas of sciences are dealing with massive information streams or \223Big Dat a\224.  Big Data is characterised by several dimensions \226 
Volume exponential growth rate Velocity increasing frequency of data generation Variety  complexity and diversity of  data types\hese characteristics pose varying challenges to domain scientists conducting data analysis.  Our research focuses on handling of temporal events a subset of Big Data characterised by high frequency event streams  The industry has increasingly adopted Complex Event Processing \(CEP\ a solution to fast and efficient processing of these event streams in real-time CEP focuses on detecting patterns of interest on event streams that are correlated in a causal, spatial or time dimension process, analysing their impact and acting upon them 
 However, CEP solutions have several drawbacks.  Lack of useability, inadequate provenance support and difficulty in reproducibility of analysis results make CEP models unsuitable to model complex scientific analyses and domain scientists often use scientific workflows to represent complex sets of computations.  Our research explores a hybrid approach, called as Scientific Event Processing SEP that extends scientific workflows to incorporate the handling of high frequency event streams, that is aimed at providing data analysts a more efficient way of conducting event analysis  This paper is organized as follows:  Section II draws a comparison of existing data processing techniques and 
establishes the motivation for our work. Section III provides an architectural overview of our proposed system.  Section IV discusses on how our proposed system can be validated Section V concludes this paper II  BACKGROUND This section explores the relative merits and demerits of both data analysis models and looks at how an integrated approach that unifies the two models would be beneficial  A  Complex Event Processing CEP   CE a s em er g e d as a  m odel t o res pon d t o h i g h  frequency data streams.  CEP engines look for patterns and relationships between unrelated events that signal new opportunities or critical threats and trigger a reaction in 
response to the detected pattern.  For example, high-frequency financial data is increasingly becoming more available to both market participants and researchers.  Several types of events relevant to the financial market have been identified such as an OrderEvent \(a market participant submitting an order to the market\radeEvent \( a timed action that relates to exchange of products between two market participants\which have been used to study market behaviou   Despite its wide adoption in the industry, CEP solutions are not without their limitations.  Currently, a wider platform that is able to integrate diverse technologies to support variety of functional and non-functional requirements is still a subject of research, as CEP technologies today are stand-alone

Current CEP solutions are only semi-automated. Data analysed by event processing systems is still required to channel through several pre-processing and post-processing tasks.  What we need is to build an infrastructure that allows the entire spectrum of processing phases from data acquisition filtering, assimilation to high-end computation tasks to be captured into a single Event Processing Network EPN\ a model that allows different components of the event processing architecture implemented with different technologies to be plugged in with minimal effort B  Scientific Workflows Scientific Workflows have emerged as a paradigm to represent and manage complex distributed scientific computations [2 t i f i c d a ta an al y s is co n s tit u t e s a pipeline of several analytical tasks such as querying single or multiple data sources, transforming data \(e.g. cleaning enriching, aggregating, summarizing\, analysing correlations detecting patterns and testing or discovering models.    Each step in the analysis process is a process or computation to be executed, which is typically achieved by end-users through a software program or statistical tool such as SPSS, SAS, and MATLAB or Business Intelligence \(BI\ol.  Currently several workflow projects such as Tavern g s 9 Kepler [1 h a v e been dem o ns trated in a v a riety of s c ie n t i f ic applications.  A complete survey describing the state-of-theart in workflow technologies is discussed in [11   Scientific workflows promise acceleration of scientific discovery through automation of computation tasks and providing support for provenance information, ensuring reproducibility of analysis processes and consistent results and sharing of analyses.  However, current workflow projects focus only on orchestration and execution of a sequence of tasks to process large data sets, and are not suited to process complex entities like event.  The article in [12 fu rth e r distinguishes between event-based and work-flow based processes.  An event-based approach is seen as a more dynamic solution, as it allows domain users to respond to situations in the context of each specific event and respond appropriately to each.  The context of a specific transaction determines the route chosen for that specific transaction While a workflow based approach is seen as being more restrictive to domain users because of its prescriptive nature It starts with a flow in mind and activities that happen are only secondary to the flow  A challenge inherent across both CEP and scientific workflows including notable open-source projects Esper Taverna, is that the technologies are not tailored to be userfriendly.  Domain users would benefit from a more graphical based abstract event processing model, rather than a programmer based model, that would allow them to tailor their own event processing networks   We look at a motivating case-study that involves a fictional analyst interested in detecting unusual price movements in trade data for Telstra exchange on the Australian Stock Exchange \(ASX\n the year 2011 and explore possible reasons behind the price jumps F rom a u s e r\222s perspective, the conceptual model is fairly simple - select an event source, detect abnormal price jumps, visualise the price jumps.  Realisation of this conceptual model however involves the use of complex price detection algorithms and comprises multiples steps: \(1\cquisition of stock data \(2 Transformation of data to a format compatible to underlying CEP engine \(3\rice Jump Detection \(4\ualisation Detection of price jumps can be realised using a CEP engine but other pre-processing and post-processing tasks requires manual coordination, using a variety of tools.  CEP alone cannot achieve complete automation of the above process Switching between different CEP engines or configuration of different price jump algorithms makes the analysis task more time-consuming. Reproducibility of analysis results also presents a challenge.  Use of scientific workflows might seem a better solution to solve reproducibility and automation, but domain users are again confronted with multiple tools and technologies that require tremendous human effort.  To orchestrate the multiple steps of analysis into a workflow requires bridging the data flow between the different components in a seamless manner  The wide spectrum of technologies available across both CEP and workflow engines has itself become an obstacle to domain-experts from purely focusing on the science.   As nontechnical domain experts are the real participants of the data analysis process, a data analysis framework from a user\222s perspective must be designed.  Domain experts are not technical, but they know their data.  They should have the flexibility to freely design an abstract, conceptual model of their analysis process, which is purely tied to the functional behaviour of the process and captures user\222s view point without specifying the underlying resources that actually implement the process.  They should be able to seamlessly interoperate with diverse tools and use existing functions and packages.  They should be able to build their process in an incremental and iterative fashion. They need to perform analysis in a collaborative manner   What we need are \223hybrid processes\224 that have work-flow like structures extended to incorporate event processing.  Such an integrated solution can capitalise on the merits of both paradigms.  It would preserve the reproducibility, automation and transparency of scientific workflows and also benefit from the non-prescriptive and powerful expressive nature of eventbased approaches.  It is also imperative that the \223hybrid processes\224 be defined at a layer of abstraction, where domain experts can conceptually orchestrate a network of event processing components into a process model, that is stable and sustainable over a rapidly changing technology  Our research realises this vision through a framework called as Scientific Event Processing  SEP SEP is a novel approach that adds a new dimension to current scientific workflow practices through the incorporation of event 307 


processing.  By adopting the principles of Service Oriented Architecture SOA  E P al s o al l o w s  u s er s t o bu i l d conceptual models of their analysis process that can be easily mapped to a variety of technology solutions.  SOA is an architectural approach that organises software components into interoperable, standards-based services service-enabled technologies that can be assembled together to create a solution to meet a particular business need. The next section presents an architectural overview of our proposed system III  OUR  PROPOSED  APPROACH Scientific Event Processing SEP\s a proposed hybrid solution that extends scientific workflows to include the processing of temporal event-streams, in a way that preserves the current principles of the scientific workflow model A  Event and Event Pattern Concepts An Event Instance is \223anything that happens or is contemplated as happening\224 A n ev e n t in s t an ce belong s to an Event Type All similar event instances are grouped under the same event type, for example the stream of event instances from a blood pressure monitor sensor.  A Temporal Event Stream is a set of event instances that are ordered for example on a timestamp.  An Event Pattern is an abstract template that matches Event Instances based on their content.  An event processing engine applies an Event Pattern on an event stream to detect and generate Event Pattern Instances \(EPI  B  Design Overview The following key design principles are proposed in support of this solution 1  Creation of abstract service components  Users should be able to build an abstract model of their event analysis process.  This is accomplished by defining abstract service components \(ASC  These components are purely functional entities from a user\222s viewpoint and can be easily mapped to a choice of suitable service-enabled  technologies  Based on the model described in h r e e  types of abstract service components are defined as shown in Table II, depending on the type of function carried out on the event stream TABLE  II TYPES  OF  ABSTRACT  SERVICE  COMPONENTS  ASC ASC Role of abstract service component Event Import Service Extract Event Instances EI\rom event sources Event Source EI Event Processing Service Filter Produces a subset of events, based on some filtering critieria,  eg:- first 100 instances EI + Filter Expression EI Transformation \(Tx  Takes input event instances and outputs event instances that are function of the input event  instances, eg translation, aggregation, merging  EI +Tx  Function EI Pattern Detection  EI + Pattern Template Matched EPI Event Export Service EPI  or EI Event Consumer 2  Composition of abstract service components into an abstract event processing network  Domain scientists will be able to build a conceptual model of their event analysis process from the set of abstract service components defined earlier as shown in Figure 1.  This model depicts an abstract event processing network EPN and the nodes represent abstract service components  Fig. 1  Conceptual Modelling of Analysis Process Composition rules will be defined to ensure that only meaningful event processing processes can be constructed Examples of valid rules are shown in Table III TABLE  IIII EXAMPLES OF VALID COMPOSITION RULES  Composition Rule Validity Import Filter Pattern Match Export Valid Import1 Merge Export Invalid \226 Merge must have two input sources Import1, Import 2 Merge  Transform Export Valid  The abstract EPN is a crucial element in our design, as it facilitates modelling the event processing at a layer of abstraction independent of underlying technology.  The abstract EPN will be captured in a template that is based on SCA Service Component Architecture  Assembly Model specifications C A prov i d es a m odel f o r com pos i ng applications that follow the principles of SOA and provides a set of specifications that describe how components implemented with different technologies can be composed together in a standard way.   Concrete service definitions will be added to this abstract template to generate a concrete workflow during the mapping phase.  These process templates are persisted to allow them to be re-used.  As domain experts examine event sources to engineer new workflows, preexisting templates will be suggested to end-users.  Users will have the flexibility to re-run the pre-existing models or customise components in the template to explore new models These process templates will assist in both consistent reproducibility of analysis results and also accelerate the pace of scientific discovery  3  Mapping of abstract event processing network to a concrete workflow  Abstract service components defined in a process template will be mapped to service-enabled technology solutions   308 


Mapping is accomplished by maintaining a catalogue of services in a service repository To select candidate services each service in the catalogue will be associated with a service type \(as defined in Table II\at will be matched against the type of the abstract service component.  The service definitions of the selected concrete services are added to the abstract process template to generate a concrete SCA composite workflow model.  This SCA composite can now be executed on any application server that supports a SCA runtime  Event streams flowing between the abstract service components are based on a common Canonical Data Model  Software components called adapters  are created where appropriate to transform data to and from the canonical model Three types of adapters will be defined \226 \(1\put adapters \(2 output adapters \(3\e ad apters. The system architecture for our proposed system is shown below  Fig. 2 SEP System Architecture C  Validation Using our proposed framework, the case-study presented in Section II is modelled as shown in figure 3  Fig. 3 An event analysis process to detect price jump events in Telstra stock IV  CONCLUSIONS Currently, no research has successfully unified event processing and scientific workflows, and provided the ability to model workflow processes in a user-oriented manner Siddhi s t rea m o ri e n t e d C E P en g i n e repres en t s t h e  closest work to our research, but user-oriented modelling is not dealt with in Siddhi.  Categorisation of abstract services in this paper is inspired by the work in ADAGE [14 A DAGE  is an architectural pattern to allow non-IT domain experts to effectively express analysis processes.  This paper extends ADAGE by formalising the concept of ADAGE abstract services using SCA specifications and their mapping to concrete services and also introduces the idea of reusable flexible processes from a user\222s perspective through use of process templates  In summary, this research proposes a novel approach to integrating handling of temporal event streams, using scientific workflows that is intended to not only provide domain users a more efficient approach to analyzing event streams, but also enable domain expert users to build flexible abstract models of their event analysis process and transparently maps them to concrete solutions.  The next phase in our research is to build an initial prototype and validate the prototype using case-study discussed in Section II R EFERENCES  1  D.Luckham and R.

  Fi g 3 V C ONCLUSIONS  This study refined our previous investigation into Bayesian network generation. In that earlier study, we decomposed any cycles found in a dependency graph into a Bayesian network. However, in such a case, the non-cycles structure remains as the original dependency graph structure Moreover, the dependency graph is derived from the Heuristic miner algorithm, which derivation does not follow the principle of Bayesian network construction, namely dependency \(independency\mong vertices. To remedy this shortcoming, in the present investigation, we employed mutual information test \(MIT o construct the Bayesian network. MIT was not originally designed for the field of business process management, and so the data set used to calculate MIT is not in the form of event logs. Thus, we propose dynamic programming for MIT calculation. Our proposed method was proved to entail less computational complexity than the recursive procedure for the original MIT calculation. Moreover, we validated our method using real port process analysis. The case study reported in these pages covered six days of observation and involved almost four hundred process instances. Considering that event logs contain time-series data, we would like to enhance this method in a more applicative direction, specifically with respect to the order Markov chain in a dy namic Bayesian network A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea NRF\ed by the Ministry of Education \(2013013143 and the National Research Foundation of Korea \(NRF\ grant funded by the Korean government \(MEST\ \(No 2012R1A1A2008335 R EFERENCES  1

 However, this does not return the result expected, explained as follows. The number of tuples in the Chunk table grows as the number of columns in Private table grows. In our running example, since each tuple is represented in two columns in the Chunk table, we cannot assume that the number of entries for Tenant 17 would be a multiple of a fixed number \(2, in our case List the hospitals and their number of beds For the Index table layout For Chunk table layout, this query could be expressed as Note a restriction here which assumes, by default, that State is assumed is of type Str1, which may not be true Find number of beds for Tenant 17 For the Index table layout, this query is formulated as follows The above query could not be expressed for the Chunk Table layout since selecting any value from the attribute çInt1é would include values corresponding to other possible attributes of all the tenants Find details of tenant, aid, name, and hospitals For the Index table  This query cannot be expressed over the Chunk Table layout Find details of hospitals and beds for each tenant This query for the Index table layout can be expressed as follows, which includes two join operations over the common attributes among the tables, namely ext_base ext_hospital, and ext_beds This query is not possible to express for the Chunk Table layout. This is because in a Chunk table, data values of similar type are stored in one column, and hence having predicates over Tenant, Chunk, and row in the WHERE clause do not help in retrieving the right data.While queries of types 0, 1, and 2 measure expressivity of the schema, we also compare the Chunk table and Index table layouts based on their space requirements. In the Index table layout, common data among tenants is always stored in the base table. The supporting tables would only include necessary rows. This reduces the space utilization to a large extent. We hence compare the sizes of Chunk table and the Base table of the Index table layout. Figure 7 illu strates the results of this comparison V CONCLUSION We studied suitable date models for multi-tenant databases, which is important to manage big data in the context of cloud computing paradigm. We proposed a data model that improves chunk model in space utilization as well as query processing. The correctness of the proposed model was discussed and illustrated through various query types We note that in terms of space, the Index table layout takes almost two third of the space taken by the Chunk table layout. We observe that the query processing times of Index table layout for queries of Type 0 improve by an order of magnitude. We also observe that the query processing times for queries that can be posed both against the Chunk table and the Index table layout \(Type 1\most the same. We compile an exhaustive set of queries as Type 2. These queries could not be supported by the Chunk table layout. This is due to the inflexibility of the Chunk table layout and poor design. Since the Index table layout is a ver tically partitioned schema, we can take advantage of column store features. This is an advantage as most of the queries for SaaS are posed on individual columns The index column of the base table can be further indexed, sorted or even hashed if the application demands  This is useful in case the schema has to be

further extended to a data warehouse like application scenario as many CUBE operations involve individual columns. The result of our experiments and analyses indicate that our proposed Index layout is more expressive than the Chunk table layout, and results in much improvemen t in performance in terms of space utilization through compression and is more expressive for supporting a wider range of query types. Its vertical partitioning and its column-store like design leads to significant increase in query processing performance. Other advantage of the Index table layout is that the mapping step of the Index table is much less complicated than that of Chunk Folding    Figure 7.

All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
