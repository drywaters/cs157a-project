Data Mining based Fragmentation and Prediction of Medical Data   Hnin Wint Khaing University of Computer Studies Mandalay, Myanmar snow.hwk@gmail.com  Abstract   Data mining concerns theories, methodologies, and in particular, computer systems for knowledge extraction or mining from large amounts of data Association rule mining is a general purpose rule discovery scheme. It has been widely used for discovering rules in medical applications The diagnosis of diseases is a significant and tedious task in 
medicine. The detection of heart disease from various factors or symptoms is an issue which is not free from false presumptions often accompanied by unpredictable effects. Thus the effort to utilize knowledge and experience of numerous specialists and clinical screening data of patients collected in databases to facilitate the diagnosis process is considered a valuable option In this paper, we presented an efficient approach for the prediction of heart attack risk levels from the heart disease database. Firstly the heart disease database is clustered using the K-means clustering algorithm, which will extract the data relevant to heart attack from the database. This approach allows mastering the number of fragments through its k parameter Subsequently the frequent patterns are mined from the extracted data, relevant to heart disease, using the MAFIA 
 Maximal Frequent Itemset Algorithm algorithm. The machine learning algorithm is trained with the selected significant patterns for the effective prediction of heart attack We have employed the ID3 algorithm as the training algorithm to show level of heart attack with the decision tree. The results showed that the designed prediction system is capable of predicting the heart attack effectively  Keywords-Data mining; Heart Disease; Frequent Patterns MAFIA\(Maximal Frequent Itemset Algorithm\lgorithm I  I NTRODUCTION  Hospitals and clinics accumulate a huge amount of 
patient data over the years. These data provide a basis for the analysis of risk factors for many diseases. For example we can predict the level of heart attack to find patterns associated with heart disease One of the major topics in data mining research is the discovery of interesting patterns in data. From the introduction of frequent itemset mining and association rules, the pattern explosion was acknowledged: at high frequency thresholds only common knowledge is revealed, while at low thresholds prohibitively many patterns are returned  A majority of areas  related to medical services such as prediction of effectiveness of surgical procedures, medical tests, medication, and the discovery of relationships among clinical and diagnosis data 
also make use of Data Mining methodologies [1    The effectiveness of medical treatments can be estimated by developing the data mining applications. Data mining is capable of delivering an analysis of which courses of action prove effective eved by co m parin g an d c ontrasting causes, symptoms, and courses of treatments  In this paper we presented prediction of the risk levels of heart attack from the heart disease database. The heart disease database consists of mixed attributes containing both the numerical and categorical data. These records are cleaned and filtered with the intention that the irrelevant data from the database would be removed before mining process occurs. Then 
clustering is performed on the preprocessed data warehouse using K-means clustering algorithm with K value so as to extract data relevant to heart attack. Subsequently the frequent patterns significant to heart disease diagnosis are mined from the extracted data using the MAFIA algorithm Finally, we used the ID3 as training algorithm to show the effective risk level with decision tree. The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows: In Section 2 a brief review of some of the works on heart disease diagnosis is presented. The fragmentation of risk level from heart disease database and extraction of significant patterns from heart disease database is presented detailed in Section 3. Architecture of the system is depicted in section 4 Experimental results are specified in section 5.The 
conclusion and future works are described in Section 6 II  R ELATED WORK  Tremendous works in literature related with heart disease diagnosis using data mining techniques have motivated our work.

Association rule mining is a major data mining technique and is a most commonly used pattern discovery method. It retrieves all frequent patterns in a data set and forms interesting rules among frequent patterns. Most frequently used association rule mining methods are Apriority and FPgrowth 7   Frequent Itemset Mining \(FIM\ is considered to be one of the elemental data mining problems that intends to discover groups of items or values or patterns that co-occur frequently in a dataset m  Heart disea s e  encompasses the diverse diseases that affect the heart. Heart disease was then major cause of casualties in the United States, England, Canada and Wales as in 2007. Heart disease kills one person every 34 seconds in the United Sta r o nar y h ear t di s e a s e Cardio m y o p at h y  and  Cardiovascular disease are some categories of heart diseases The term cardiovascular diseaseŽ includes a wide range of conditions that affect the heart and the blood vessels and the manner in which blood is pumped and circulated through the body. Cardiovascular disease \(CVD\ts in severe illness, disability, and death [1   III  THEORITICAL BACKGROND  A  Fragmentation of heart attack data using K_mean clustering The wide acceptance of the relational approach in dataprocessing applications and the continuous improvement of commercially existing relational databases has increased the interest for using database in non-conventional applications such as computer-aided design \(CAD\raphic information systems, image, and graphic database systems 10  The relat iona l app r o a c h d i sti n guishes two ki nds of  fragmentation: horizontal and vertical. There are many algorithms developed for horizontal and vertical fragmentation n  t his paper, we propo s e d  k m e an clustering based fragmentation. Clustering is the process to divide a data set into several classes or clusters, and the same data objects within a group are of higher similarity while data objects in different groups are of lower similarity Clustering medical data into small yet meaningful clusters can aid in the discovery of patterns by supporting the extraction of numerous appropriate features from each of the clusters thereby introducing structure into the data and aiding the application of conventional data mining techniques. In this paper, we proposed the most popular distance measure Euclidean distance which is defined as dist \(i, j j i x x       2 2 2 2 2 1 1       jp ip j i j i x x x x x x        where   ip i i x x x i   2 1  and   jp j j x x x j   2 1  are two p _dimensional data objects The steps involved in a K-means algorithm 1  i x points denoting the data to be clustered are placed into the space. These points denote the primary group centroids 2  The data are assigned to the group that is adjacent to the centroid 3  The positions of all the j x centroids are recalculated as soon as all the data are assigned Steps 2 and 3 are reiterated until the centroids stop moving any further. This results in the separation of data into groups from which the metric to be minimized can be deliberated The preprocessed heart disease database is clustered using the K-means algorithm with K value as 2. One cluster consists of the data relevant to the heart disease and the other contains the remaining data. Later on, the frequent patterns are mined from the cluster relevant to heart disease using the MAFIA algorithm  B  Frequent pattern mining using MAFIA  Frequent Itemset Mining \(FIM\ is considered to be one of the elemental data mining problems that intends to discover groups of items or values or patterns that co-occur frequently in a dataset. The extraction of significant patterns from the heart disease data warehouse is presented in this section. The heart disease database contains the screening clinical data of heart patients. Frequent Itemset Mining FIM\is considered to be one of the elemental data mining problems that intends to discover groups of items or values or patterns that co-occur frequently in a dataset. It is of vital significance in a variety of Data Mining tasks that aim to mine interesting patterns from databases, like association rules, correlations, sequences, episodes, classifiers, clusters and the like. The proposed approach utilizes an efficient algorithm called MAFIA \(Maximal Frequent Itemset Algorithm\ which combines diverse old and new algorithmic ideas to form a practical algorithm I n th is paper, we presented the MFPA \(Maximal Frequent Pattern Algorithm\ algorithm for the frequent patterns applicable to heart disease are mined from the data extracted MFPA algorithm Pseudo code for MAFIA MAFIA C  MFI Boolean IsHUT  name HUT  C head  C tail if HUT is in MFI Stop generation of children and return Count all children; use PEP to trim the tail, and recorder by increasing support For each item i in C trimmed_tail IsHUT whether i is the first item in the tail newNode C I MAFIA \(newNode MFI, IsHUT  if IsHUT and all extensions are frequent Stop search and go back up subtree If C is a leaf and C head is not in MFI  


Add C head to MFI  The cluster that contains data most relevant to heart attack is fed as input to MAFIA algorithm to mine the frequent patterns present in it C  Decision Tree Representation Decision trees are a popular logical method for classification. A decision tree is a hierarchical structure that partitions data into some disjoint groups based on their different attribute values. Leafs of a decision tree contain records of one or nearly one class, and so it has been used for classification. An advantage of decision tree methods is that decision trees can be converted into  understandable rules. A most widely used decision tree system is C4.5, its ancestor ID3, and a commercial version C5.0 .Decision trees have been mainly used to build diagnosis models for medical data. When it is used for exploring patterns in medical data, work in shows that it is inadequate for such exploration 1  I n this pap er, we  u s ed the ID3 alg orith m   uses the information gain measure to select among the candidate attributes at each step while growing the tree Information gain, is simply the expected reduction in entropy caused by portioning the examples according to this attribute. The information gain Gain \(S , A of an attribute A, relative to a collection of example S, is defined as               v A Values v v S Entropy S S S Entropy A S Gain     1  i c i i p p S Entropy 2 1 log       2   where p i is the proportion of S belonging to class i  IV  S YSTEM ARCHITECTURE    Heart Disease dataset K-Mean clustering Classify the pattern using ID3 algorithm MAFIA\(Maximal Frequent Itemset Algorithm Display effective heart attack level Cluster relevant and irrelevant data Select Frequent Pattern  V  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  The results of our experimental analysis in finding significant patterns for heart attack prediction are presented in this section. With the help of the database, the patterns significant to the heart attack prediction are extracted using the approach discussed. The heart disease database is preprocessed successfully by removing duplicate records and supplying missing values as shown in table I. The refined heart disease data set, resultant from preprocessing is then clustered using K-means algorithm with K value as 2 One cluster consists of the data relevant to the heart disease as shown in table II and the other contains the remaining data  Then the frequent patterns are mined efficiently from the cluster relevant to heart disease, using the MAFIA algorithm. The sample combinations of heart attack parameters for normal and risk level along with their values and levels are detailed below  In that, lesser value \(0.1 weight comprises the normal level of prediction and higher values other than 0.1 comprise the higher risk levels. Table III show the parameters of heart attack prediction with corresponding values and their levels. Table IV show the example of training data to predict the heart attack level and then figure 2 shows the efficient heart attack level with tree using the ID3 by information gain

These days, the exploitation of knowledge and experience of numerous specialists and clinical screening data of patients gathered in a database during the diagnosis procedure, has been widely recognized. In this paper we have presented an efficient approach for fragmenting and extracting significant patterns from the heart disease data warehouses for the efficient prediction of heart attack.

VII  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  Subgroup discovery is referring to discovery of relations among attributes and predicted classes. This problem has been generally studied in the past with techniques enabled by statistics, datamining and human experts. It is considered as a hybrid between predictive modeling and descriptive analysis where subgroups of similar data are formed pertaining to predicting a particular target class. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for subgroup discovery by using Bayesian network. By this method, probabilities of likenesses for each relation can be explicitly calculated \(that has an advantage of white-box modeling\ and each subgroup can be represented by rules that are readily interpretable for modeling the relations We verified this method by using a small example and reasonable results are produced preliminarily. In the future, we would be working on constructi ng a software prototype that implements this new scheme. We will be putting it to work on actual datasets in large volume so that their results can be further evaluated and compared against other subgroup discovery algorithms for benchmarking. We are also working on evaluating the performance of various quality functions other than WRAcc\ for the purpose of subgroup discovery Considering the good results that Bayesian network has achieved in classification, it is believed that it can yield good results in subgroup discovery scheme as well  R EFERENCES   1  J.

B b \(6 Fig. 2. ARAM neural network If any of the inequalities of \(6 inhibited, if all nodes are inhibited, a new uncommitted node is added. The Match Tracking process is started if needed When each match criterion is satisfied in the respective module, resonance occurs and the learning process follows During learning the selected node K learns to encode the input and target vectors by adjusting its weight vectors W aK and W bK similarly to \(5 B. Multi-label Extensions It has been shown in [7] that standard algorithms do not perform well on the muti-label datasets due to the use of the WTA rule \(2 been proposed: A set of Nb best categories with the largest activation values is chosen according to the rule: a category k is included in the set, if the relative difference \(TK?Tk is below a predefined fraction t of the activation range r = TK ? Tmin, where Tmin is the minimum activation of committed neurons. Activations of the Nb categories are subsequently normalized, uk = TkPN b s=1 Ts The resulting distributed output pattern P is calculated as follows P Nb s=1 usps. \(7 where for FAM ps = W br with r such that W ab sr = 1 which means that between neurons s of ARTa and r of ARTb an association in the Map field exists, and ps = W bs for ARAM. Thus, P contains a score for each label that is proportional to the number of neurons among the Nb best categories predicting this label. Since the fast learning of ART networks leads to varying performance with the input presentation order, voting across several networks trained with different orderings of a training set improves classi 


fication performance. The sum over the output of Equation 7 pattern P , which is used to determine the predicted classes Finally, a postprocessing filter method [12] is applied: the signals P are sorted descendingly, then all corresponding output classes are included in the multi-label up to the point of maximum decrease in the signal size from one class to the next A small modification is made in the ARTb weights, which now count label occurrences during learning by increasing their values by 1 each time the corresponding multi-label is presented. This modification leads to changes in the ARTb activation calculation of ML-FAM which is Tk = |B?W bk Another difference between the multi-label and the standard algorithms is that the former ones do not use Match Tracking with raising vigilance: The winner is simply inhibited C. Comparison of Classifiers To compare the two ART-based networks with other MLclassifiers, we chosen ML-kNN described in [8] and BoosTexter [9] which is an implementation of Boosting for the field of text categorization, based on the well-known AdaBoost algorithm [15]. ML-kNN and BoosTexter were chosen since these popular MC algorithms are nearest-neighbor- and rulebased, respectively, and therefore allow a comparison of the results of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM with algorithms based on other approaches than neural networks IV. PROXIMITY MEASURES FOR HIERARCHIES Approaches for quantitative comparison of graphs and trees are either defined on an abstract level, taking into account only the pure graph structure, or make use of the field specific semantics encoded in the graph. From the former category, we utilized the Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED  whereas Taxonomic Overlap \(TO  field of concept representation, which also deals with hierarchical structures encoded in graphs and trees. Additionally the Lowest Common Ancestor Path Distance \(LCAPD new tree distance measure, developed especially for the type of hierarchies common in HMC. A description of the mutual differences between these measures and the motivation for the development of a new metric are given at the end of this section 


A. Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED [10] is based upon the idea of transforming one hierarchy into another via certain local editing operations The distance between two hierarchies is the minimum total number of operations needed for transforming the one into the other. Three modification operations are considered: A node i is deleted by transmitting its children to its parent and removing i from the hierarchy. Inserting is the complement of deleting: Inserting i as a child of j makes i the parent of some subset of the children of j. Changing a node means changing its label. In order to make computation in polynomial time possible, the constraint that disjoint subtrees have to be mapped to disjoint subtrees is included in the definition [10], [16 The original definition does not include any normalization For two hierarchies with q labels each, 2q is the highest possible CTED  corresponding to deleting all labels of the first hierarchy and inserting all labels of the second hierarchy We normalize the CTED by 12q which results in distances in 0, 1 B. Taxonomic Overlap TO [11] compares the nodes of two hierarchies according to how many ancestors and descendants they share. We describe a version adapted to our experiments. Define semantic cotopy as SC\(i,H i j Given two hierarchies H1 and H2, the corresponding overlap for i ? L is defined as O\(i,H1, H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 Note that this is a symmetric expression in H1 and H2 with values in [0, 1]. The TO of H1 and H2 is the average of all overlaps TO\(H1, H2 1 q  i?L O\(i,H1, H2 For two identical hierarchies, TO is 1, while it is 0 if H1 and H2 are totally unrelated. Since the two other hierarchy 


proximity measures used in the experiments are distances with smaller values indicating higher similarity TO? := 1? TO to simplify comparisons C. LCA-Path Tree Distance Since in a hierarchy a parent is a more general concept than any of its children, the locations of the same label i in two hierarchies H1 and H2 can be compared by how far one has to travel up the chain of ancestors in both hierarchies until a common ancestor is found. For a label i ?

AH2\(i  lca\(i,H1, H2 Since 0 is an ancestor of all labels in all hierarchies, the LCA always exists. Note that usually lca\(i,H1, H2 lca\(i,H2, H1 We use the LCA to measure how far apart the positions of a label in both hierarchies are: If a label i has the same parent in both hierarchies it is regarded as being in the same position, otherwise the distances of i to its LCA in both hierarchies are used to measure how far apart both locations are. The cost for i is defined as d\(i,H1, H2 2 k=1 dHk\(i lca\(i,H1, H2 D\(i,H1, H2  0, if pH1\(i i d\(i,H1, H2 8 This can be seen as the length of the path from i to lca\(i,H1, H2 i,H1, H2 As D is not symmetric, the complete LCA-path distance

Comparison All three hierarchy proximity measures presented above reflect different concepts of tree similarity. It is thus not surprising that CTED and TO*, although they perform well in the domains they were designed for, may produce counterintuitive results when used in the field of HE. This is demonstrated by the hierarchies shown in Figure 3: Despite the fact that the relationships between the nodes in both hierarchies are completely different, their CTED and TO are 0.33 and 0.44, respectively. Their LCAPD, on the other hand, is 1.00. Thus only LCAPD marks both hierarchies with the highest possible distance Some hierarchies used in our experiments contain nodes with exactly one child \(single-child labels that TO* does not distinguish between such labels and their children, in the following sense: Given a hierarchy H and a single-child node i, we denote with H ? the hierarchy 


that is obtained from H by swapping i and its child. Then TO?\(H,H CTED or LCAPD V. EXPERIMENTS We tested the proposed data mining system with four multi-label classifiers: ML-FAM, ML-ARAM, ML-kNN and BoosTexter on three real-world datasets with increasing complexity from the text-mining field. In our experiments we compared extracted hierarchies to the original hierarchy by means of three hierarchy proximity measures: LCAPD CTED, and TO The experimental setup of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM had the following parameter values: choice parameter 0.0001; learning rates ?a,b = 1.0 for fast learning; vigilance parameters ?a = 0.9 and ?b = 1.0. The parameter t was chosen to be 0.05 for the 20 newsgroups dataset and 0.02 for the other datasets. The number of voters V was set to 9 Following [8], we used 10 nearest neighbors \(k = 10 Laplace smoothing \(s = 1 BoosTexter was trained using 500 boosting rounds as in 8] and the threshold for converting rankings into multi-labels was set to 0 [9 A. Multi-label Classification Performance Measures We used a large set of performance measures for evaluation of the MC experiments: First, two example-based measures for multi-label predictions: Accuracy \(A measure \(F  of the predicted labels are actually present while F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall calculated on the per-instance basis. The larger the A and F values, the better the MC performance Then two label-based measures were calculated on the basis of binary counts for each label: the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives We used the micro-averaged version of F1 with the binary measures counted on the whole test set. The perfect performance corresponds to F1 = 1. Additionally, micro-averaged precision and recall were used for computing the Area Under a Precision-Recall Curve \(AUPRC  precision corresponds to the proportion of predicted labels in the test set that are correct and recall to the proportion of labels that are correctly predicted. AUPRC has been claimed 


to be a well-suited performance measure for MC tasks where the number of negative instances significantly exceeds the number of positive instances [6]. Another advantage of AUPRC is its global nature and independence of a certain threshold value. The closer the AUPRC value is to 1, the better the performance Since these measures are based on the comparison of multi-labels, they depend on a transformation from rankings to classes. As a contrast we also used four wellknown ranking-based performance measures: One-Error OE RL C cision \(AP  for all ranking-based performance measures except AP. OneError evaluates how many times the top-ranked label is not in the set of proper labels of the instance. Ranking Loss is defined as the average fraction of pairs of labels that are ordered incorrectly. Coverage evaluates how far we need, on average, to go down the list of labels in order to cover all the proper labels of the instance. Average Precision evaluates the average fraction of labels ranked above a particular label i ? mt which actually are in mt And finally, the special hierarchical loss function H-loss 2] were utilized. Following [3], normalized costs were calculated: ci := 1/|c\(p\(i i ? L i of all direct children of i. Hierarchical loss \(H-loss consider mistakes made in subtrees of incorrectly predicted labels and penalizes only the first mistake along the path from the root to a node. The smaller the H-loss value, the better the performance B. 20 Newsgroups Dataset We modified the popular single-label dataset 20 Newsgroups [18], [19] by considering eight additional labels corresponding to the intermediate levels of the hierarchy faith, recreation, recreation/sport, recreation/vehicles, politics, computer, computer/hardware, science. This dataset is a collection of almost 20,000 postings from 20 newsgroups sorted by date into training \(60 40 data were preprocessed by discarding all words appearing only in the test documents and all words found in the stop word list [20]. Afterwards, all but the 2%-most-frequent words were eliminated to reduce the dimensionality. Documents were represented using the well-known TF-IDF \(Term 


Frequency  Inverse Document Frequency scheme [19]. The TF-IDF weights were then normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Conversion to TF-IDF and normalization were performed separately for training and test data. This resulted in the 1,070-dimensional dataset with 11,256 training instances, 7,493 test ones and 28 labels To test the performance of two HE algorithms, we first extracted hierarchies from the True Test Multi-Labels \(TTML and calculated the corresponding proximity measures. Both algorithms successfully extracted the original hierarchy We studied the performance of the multi-label classifiers and their ability to infer the class hierarchies in the presence of only partly available hierarchical information. We performed a series of HE experiments with multi-labels having a decreasing number of inserted non-leaf labels describing the levels in the hierarchy. We randomly removed such labels from 20%, 30%, and 40% of the training instances leaving them single-labeled. The results for predicted test multilabels are shown in Table I where the bold face marks the best classifier, and the first column \(left result of HE by Voting and the second \(right Thresholding \(referred as GT Comparing classification performance, one can see that the ART-based networks are superior to both the other classifiers in terms of most performance measures and that ML-FAM slightly outperforms ML-ARAM. Taken together they win on at least 6 and at most 8 out of 9 evaluation measures. BoosTexter has the second best performance, but its predictive power degrades more quickly with the increase in the number of single-label instances. The poorest MC results were shown by ML-kNN, its performance decreased very fast with any reduction in the number of multi-labels For example, F1 decreased by 15% while removing 40% of labels instead of 30%. It is also interesting to note that when trained on the dataset with 40% removed labels, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM significantly outperformed ML-kNN trained on the original dataset with all labels The hierarchy proximity measures confirm the good quality of predictions produced by the ART-based networks: The hierarchies were correct extracted by both HE algorithms of Section II-B even with 40% removed labels. The predictions of ML-kNN were the worst: The Voting variant of the HE 


algorithm could not extract the correct hierarchy with 30 assigning five labels incorrectly to the root label. None of the HE algorithms could extract the correct hierarchy in the absence of 40% multi-labels. With 40% and Voting, the number of labels falsely assigned to the root was 13, while with GT it was only three. For BoosTexter, Voting assigned two labels wrongly to the root label in the experiment with TABLE I 20 NEWSGROUPS ALL, -20%, -30% AND -40% RESULTS Measure all 20% 30% 40%ARAM FAM kNN BoosT.

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the 


root label in the hierarchies of the ART networks.

Here, GT extracted a much worse hierarchy as shown by CTED being 0.15 higher for GT than for Voting For BoosTexter both HE methods built the same hierarchy and no label was wrongly assigned to the root. All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
