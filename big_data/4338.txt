I I NTRODUCTION The growing adoption of a set of best practices collectively referred to as Linked Data for publishing structured data on the Web has made it possible to link and share many disparate previously isolated distributed autonomously generated and managed data across virtually every domain of human endeavor The community-driven Linked Open Data LOD effort allows structured data to be represented using Resource Description Framework RDF in the form of subject-predicate-object triples also called RDF triples which describe a directed graph where the directed labeled edges encode binary relations between labeled nodes RDF stores and associated query 
languages such as SPARQL of fer the means to store and query large amounts of RDF data LOD also enables integration of previously isolated distributed data such as data stored in multi-relational databases At present LOD include a few hundred linked data sets that together contain Figure 1 A motivating scenario of two RDF stores that are linked to form a 
chain 
of RDF stores Facebook users share posts about news items published in New York Times in excess of a few trillion RDF triples These co v er a broad range of domains including government life sciences 
geography social media and commerce The emergence of LOD offers unprecedented opportunities for using disparate data sources in predictive modeling and decision making in such domains We motivate the problem of learning predictive models from multiple interlinked RDF stores using the scenario shown in Fig 1 In this case one might want to use data from Facebook and New York Times to predict the interest of a user in belonging to a Facebook group based on the distribution of tags associated with the New York Times news stories that the user has shared with her social network on Facebook This is an instance of the node prediction 
problem 
 In general b uilding such predicti v e models entails using information from multiple interlinked physically distributed autonomously maintained RDF stores In such a setting it is neither desirable nor feasible to gather all of the data in a centralized location for analysis because of access memory bandwidth and computational restrictions In other settings access to data may be limited due to privacy and conìdentiality constraints 9 This calls for techniques for learning predictive models e.g classiìers from multiple interlinked RDF stores that support only access to data e.g via a query interface such as SPARQL Barring 
indirect 
Lin et al who proposed an approach to learning relational Bayesian classiìers from a 
remote RDF store using statistical queries against its SPARQL endpoint to the best of our knowledge there has been very little work on this problem Against this background we consider the problem of learning predictive models from RDF stores Speciìcally we i introduce statistical query based formulations of several representative algorithms for learn

from its root and leaf projections is a special case of the matrix reconstruction problem Hence we can adapt existing approaches from CT and one of the simplest such methods is Algebraic Reconstruction Technique ART AR T is an iterati v e algorithm for solving a system of linear equations where each equation encodes the projection angle and its projected value from a matrix Here we describe the update equation in our simpliìed case of column and row projections Let be the element of rowand columnof an bymatrix representing our reconstructed matrix and let and be its column and row projections respectively Let and be the true column and row projections respectively i.e those computed from the original matrix Then the update equation is where is a relaxation parameter between 0 and 1 III L EARNING C LASSIFIERS FROM M ULTIPLE I NTERLINKED RDF D ATA S TORES We now turn to the problem of learning predictive models from multiple  interlinked data sources Consider the scenario shown in Fig 2 We assume that each data source corresponds to an RDF store that can be queried through an access interface e.g SPARQL query server and optionally a sandbox that is set up with write access for each user i.e learner We can use SPARQL 1.1 update queries to store intermediate results of queries in the sandbox for use by the learner Also we can use SPARQL 1.1 federated queries to retrie v e query results from other remote servers as needed and store them in the sandbox for use by the learner Thus an RDF data set is fragmented across sites into data set fragments such that  we further assume that the learner may be subject to access constraints associated with such that  An access constraint may restrict the class of queries that can be answered by a data source e.g due to privacy considerations or the query answering capabilities of the data source The task of learning from multiple interlinked RDF stores can be stated as follows Deìnition 2 A Distributed RDF Learner is an algorithm that given the fragments of a training data set distributed across the sites through a set of access interfaces with access constraints  a hypothesis class  and a performance criterion  outputs a classiìer that optimizes using only the interactions against that are allowed by  It is useful to consider three generic ways in which an RDF data set can be fragmented across multiple interlinked RDF stores A Characterizing RDF Data Fragmentation The simplest case of RDF data set fragmentation corresponds to the setting where there are no links between individual data stores However in general the data stores may contain triples edges that link two or more data stores E.g a triple could be in while could be in  We refer to the set of all resources that play the role of either the subject or the object of an RDF triple in a data set as the resources of a data set we use the term subject resources to refer to the set of all resources that appear only as the subject of an RDF triple in the data set we use the term object resources to refer to the set of all resources that appear only as the object of an RDF triple in the data set We can now identify three special cases of data fragmentation across multiple interlinked RDF stores Fig 3 1 The link-free normal form LFNF where different fragments do not share any resources 2 The out-link normal form OLNF where different fragments do not share any subject resources 3 The in-link normal form ILNF where different fragments do not share any object resources The scenario in Fig 1 is an example of OLNF Note that formally an RDF store holds a set of triples edges and in

Figure 5 RDF Schema of Last.fm data set Figure 6 Projection and matrix errors at various stages of ART approximation Figure 7 Classiìcation performance using data reconstructed at various stages of ART approximation general the resources nodes are not necessarily owned by any data store thus it is possible that a set of data sources can simultaneously conform to both OLNF and ILNF as in Fig 3 However in practice the domain name of a resource often indicates its ownership hence if a set of data sources satisfy both OLNF and ILNF we can use the domain name of the resources to determine which normal form is more appropriate to use We further note that the three normal forms described above are not exhaustive i.e an RDF data set can in general be fragmented in ways that do not conform to any of the three normal forms considered here We observe that obtaining the statistics needed for learning classiìers from multiple RDF stores when the data fragmentation corresponds to LFNF reduces to combining the results of the statistical queries from the individual sources e.g the root and leaf projections see Fig 4 top Because we can decompose the statistical queries in this fashion the communication complexity of learning classiìers from multiple RDF data sources in LFNF is equivalent to that of learning classiìers from a single RDF store obtained by taking the union of the RDF triples from the respective sources

WLOG we focus on only OLNF We consider a chain of interlinked RDF stores e.g Fig 1 Speciìcally we address the problem of obtaining the sufìcient statistics in Sec II-C without having to gather the data from multiple RDF stores into a central location First we describe how to obtain the leaf and root projections in such a setting Consider an attribute  and let be the number of resources shared between and  We deìne a bymatrix where the value at rowand columnis the total number of paths that connect the shared resources indexed by and respectively We set to be number of instances and set to be number of possible values for attribute  Now we have and  We note that it is more efìcient to multiply the matrices from the left to right for  and from right to left for see Fig 4 bottom Thus the leaf projection is computed starting at by transferring 1 to  and so on ending up with at which is then transferred to the learner The root projection is computed in a similar fashion starting at and working towards It is easy to see that the communication costs associated with the computation of the leaf and root projections respectively are given by and  In the case of required by CCVD NB\(Dir and NB\(Pol we rst gather the leaf projection and the root projection as described above and use ART to reconstruct the corresponding see Sec II-D which is used to construct the predictive model In the case of aggregation we use the approximated to compute the aggregation function  We note that NB\(Ber and NB\(Mul classiìers can be learned from the leaf projections for each class  alone which guarantees that the classiìers learned from an OLNF fragmented RDF data set are identical to their centralized counterparts that are learned from the data set obtained by combining the fragments IV E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS We used a real world data set crawled from a social music network Last.fm 3 using its API its schema is shown in Fig 5 We selected two disjoint groups that contain approximately equal number of users 2098/2081 and include those tracks and artists whose number of occurrences are greater than or equal to 45 and 100 respectively Likewise we eliminated all the trackês tags and artistês tags that occurred fewer than 350 and 120 times All collections of tags are preprocessed by removing stop words and stemming using Apache Lucene The resulting data set is converted to RDF format which includes 8340 tracks attributed to one or more of the 3753 artists From this data we extracted two subsets i Dataset-Track which includes only the tags associated with the tracks and ii Dataset-Artist which includes only the tags associated with the artists In both cases the task is to predict the group of the user We simulate the OLNF setting by suitably fragmenting the datasets For example in the case of Dataset-Track we store the triples of and in and the triples of in such that resources are shared between and

The rst set of experiments was designed to compare the performance of the proposed approaches to learning classiìers from an RDF data set that is fragmented in OLNF across multiple RDF stores with their centralized counterparts that have access to the entire data set in a single location We trained two aggregation models and four generative models described in Sec II-B the aggregation coupled with a naive Bayes classiìer Mode+NB the CCVD aggregation coupled with a logistic regression classiìer CCVD+LR and the four naive Bayes generative models NB\(Ber NB\(Mul NB\(Dir and NB\(Pol Note that NB\(Ber and NB\(Mul need only leaf projections and therefore their models under OLNF is provably exact with respect to its centralized counterparts The rest of the classiìers in the OLNF setting rely on the ART approximations of and hence their performance is a function of the quality of the approximation In this experiment the termination threshold difference between the true projection and its ART reconstruction is set to of the size of the matrix and is set to  The results in Table I show that i not surprisingly the performance of Mode+NB CCVD+LR NB\(Dir and NB\(Pol that rely on ART approximation of the needed statistics in the OLNF setting is always no better than that of their centralized counterparts which do not have to rely on the ART approximation and can instead use the statistics obtained directly from the entire data set ii NB\(Pol despite its reliance on the ART approximation in the OLNF setting shows performance that is competitive with its centralized counterpart although the latter has the advantage of using statistics obtained directly from the entire data set and iii NB\(Mul surprisingly is quite competitive with NB\(Pol in both centralized and OLNF settings despite using less information than NB\(Pol The previous experiment used a xed termination threshold for the iterative ART approximation procedure Be3 http://www.last.fm is a function of the quality of the approximation which in turn depends on the the number of ART iterations we designed an experiment to explore this dependence In this set of experiments we used 80 of the data for training and 20 of the data for testing First we measure the error of the reconstruction as estimated by i projection error which is the sum of absolute differences of each element between the true and reconstructed leaf and root projections and ii matrix error which is the sum of absolute difference of each element between the true and reconstructed matrices We also measure the classiìcation accuracies of the trained models in the case of Mode+NB CCVD+LR NB\(Dir and NB\(Pol which make use of the ART approximation The results summarized in Fig 6 show that the projection error approaches zero after a sufìciently large number of iterations however the matrix error remains relatively high even after 1000 iterations In the case of classiìcation accuracies we note three clear trends shown in Fig 7 i Mode+NB using the ART approximation does not quite approach Mode+NB that uses statistics obtained directly from the data regardless of the number of ART iterations ii the performance of NB\(Dir lags that of NB\(Pol during the rst few iterations of ART but both achieve comparable performance with increasing number of ART iterations and iii CCVD+LR starts off with the worst performance but shows steady improvement with increasing number of ART iterations However theoretical underpinnings of these observations remain to be investigated The third experiment was designed to measure the communication cost of obtaining the projections required by the ART approximation Since the size of query is negligible compared to the query results in our setting we measure only the size of query results transferred as the size of the underlying data set is varied We used Dataset-Track and Dataset-Artist described in Sec IV-A considering subsets of users ranging from 400 to 4000 in steps of 400 retaining in each case only the resources tracks artists tags that are connected to the subset of users We recorded the size of raw RDF data in TTL format the size of leaf projection

the size of root projection and nally the size of matrix stored as an adjacency list The results of this experiment summarized in Fig 8 show that not surprisingly the size of raw data as well as matrices are signiìcantly larger than the leaf and root projections demonstrating the advantages of ART approximation in learning classiìers from large OLNF-fragmented RDF data sets over alternative approaches that transmit the data or the matrix as opposed to only the leaf and root projections from the data source\(s to the learner In the case of DatasetArtist we observe that the size of matrix even exceeds that of raw data and this can be explained by the fact that a majority of artists are shared among indirectly connected to different users which blows up the size of the matrix whereas in the RDF representation the artist resources and their tags only appear once in the data set V S UMMARY AND D ISCUSSION The emergence of many interlinked physically distributed and autonomously maintained RDF stores such as the LOD cloud offers unprecedented opportunities for predictive modeling and knowledge discovery from such data However existing machine learning approaches are limited in their applicability because it is neither desirable nor feasible to gather all of the data in a centralized location for analysis due to access memory bandwidth computational restrictions and sometimes privacy or conìdentiality constraints Against this background we propose to learn classiìers from multiple interlinked RDF stores via their SPARQL query interfaces Speciìcally we have i introduced statistical query based formulations of several representative algorithms for learning classiìers from RDF data ii introduced a distributed learning framework to learn classiìers from multiple interlinked RDF stores iii identiìed three special cases of RDF data fragmentation and describe effective strategies for learning in each case iv considered a novel application of a matrix reconstruction technique from the eld of Computerized Tomography to approximate the statistics needed by the learning algorithm from projections using count queries thus dramatically reducing the amount of information transmitted from the remote data sources to the learner and v reported results of experiments with a real-world social network data set which demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach Most of the existing work on learning predictive models from RDF data e.g 19 assume that the learner has direct access to data Lin et al proposed an approach to learning relational Bayesian classiìers from a remote RDF store in a setting where the learner can only query the RDF data store through a restricted class of statistical queries This paper extends the work in to the setting of multiple interlinked RDF stores using a larger class of predictive models including Mode+NB CCVD+LR NB\(Dir and NB\(Pol where for practical reasons we have to approximate the relevant statistics Our approach takes advantage of SPARQL 1.1 update queries and federated queries which e xtends the remote access frame w ork rst introduced in to multiple RDF stores As opposed to federated query processing approaches for RDF data  22 23 which focus on the problem of answering queries formulated in a general purpose query language from multiple RDF data sources our focus in this paper is on answering restricted classes of statistical queries needed for learning classiìers from RDF data Restricting the classes of queries to those that useful in the learning predictive models from RDF data allows us to take advantage of optimizations such as the efìcient accumulation of projections Sec III-B The work of w as inspired by a general learning framework proposed by Caragea et al for learning classiìers from distributed data 24 Ho we v er  to the best of our knowledge the approaches described in this paper are among the rst of their kind for learning classiìers from an RDF data set that is fragmented across multiple interlinked RDF stores ART the method for reconstructing an approximation of a matrix from its projections is among the simplest such technique originally developed in the eld of CT Other promising matrix reconstruction methods worth exploring in our setting include ltered backprojection and quadratic optimization The kinds of RDF data fragmentation considered in this paper are relatively simple albeit interesting special cases It would be interesting to consider learning classiìers in a setting where an RDF data set is fragmented across multiple RDF stores that are connected through more complex linkage patterns including in particular trees and DAGs as opposed to the linear chains considered in this study Lastly it is of interest to consider richer classes of predictive models and the corresponding learning problems including those that model dependency between attributes e.g adaptations of statistical relational learning or feature construction strategies for linked data A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported in part by a grant IIS 0711356 from the National Science Foundation NSF and in part by the Iowa State University Center
