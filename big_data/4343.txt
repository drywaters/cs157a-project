only see a short distance ahead because of heavy rain each pixel of the scenes taken by camera is not always covered by rain If pixel is affected by rain this pixel has large intensity but this pixel has original chromatic information Consequently we make a recovery to original color value via decreasing intensity to original value Proposing recursive data processing we can estimate the intensity value of each pixel And this method needs the periodic reset If unsuitable estimated mean value is determined because of heavy noise henceforth 
cleanly captured scene has little weight effect for estimated mean value Accordingly we reset the weighted value between estimated intensity and new captured one Additionally the proposed method has big advantages including small equation by repeatedly estimating the mean of intensity and handling in real-time and benefits that too simple and it can implement to real time processing And we obtain more pure scene than existing methods Keywords Rain Removal Kalman Filter 1 INTRODUCTION In indoor environment video is captured in 
ideal environment because artificial illumination is formed Other hands in outdoor environment it is important to remove weather effect Because natural environment have various noise such as steady weather condition fog mist and haze and dynamic weather condition rain snow and hail 3 Therefore it is difficult to implement in robust environment that vision algorithms such as feature detection segmentation and object recognition Removal of bad weather effect is developed by Garg and Nayar In steady weather water droplets or smoke particles are very 
small and steadily float in the air By modeling the scattering and chromatic effects he gets the good results In dynamic weather he developed the physical properties of Rain Using spatial temporal property detect the rain region For reduce the false alarm Garg and Nayar use compute spatio-temporal correlation But this method has complex processes 2 Another proposed method that by properly setting a camcorder's parameters such as exposure time aperture etc the rain could be removed when recording the video 
But this method cannot handle the scenario of heavy rain and motion blurred.[4 Zhang proposed that incorporates both temporal and chromatic properties of rain in video The temporal property states that an image pixel is not always covered by rain throughout the entire video The chromatic property states that the changes of R G and B values of rain-affected pixels are approximately the same In rain detection K-mean Clustering divide between rain and background region By a blending replace the rain region 
But this method is not a real time processing 1 We propose a new algorithm that Intensity estimation using Kalman Filter in real time system 7 Assume that camera and captured object are fixed We calculate the estimated intensity using Recursive data processing for real time processing Proposed method is very simple and has good results 2 PROPERTIES OF RAIN 2.1 Temporal Property of Rain Fig 1 show that the spatial temporal property of rain The pixel of n frame has large intensity when rain is 
captured Therefore rain produces sharp intensity variations at a pixel Rain has the temporal property states that an image pixel is not always covered by rain throughout the entire video Although pixel is covered by rain this pixel has chromatic information Therefore we make a recovery to original color value via descend intensity to original value ID_ nnlf n I Frm I jb I   Ud_ Fig 1 The intensity change at a pixel due to a falling raindrop 494

As an example, Figure 5-1 illustrates the fault stage classification procedure for a sy stem with three fault stages Transient features are a pplied to all GM-HMMs         Figure 5-1 Block diagram for a GM-HMM based  classifier  The fault stage classification can be made based on Bayes\222 Theorem.

The test duration was 2000 minutes Acceleration data were recorded on two channels at 5.0 Hz sampling frequency. Two channe ls provide the chance to limit part of the noise and also provide with information  about the optimum placement of the sensors. Table 6-1 summarizes the operating conditions for this experiment  Table 6-1 226 Operating conditions for one experiment      Figure 6-1 shows the vibration data at one channel. The major change of the accelera tion data occurs after the healthy condition of bearing illustrating high vibration peaks. While bearing working at healthy condition, i.e. the first 600 minutes, the acceleration response is bounded within    6 determines the volume of the k th cluster D k its orientation and A k its shape  261 2V. As the coating wears out, the balls begin to touch the bare metal surface As a result, the vibration signal register \223impact-type\224 shocks that appear as spikes. It should be noted that to extract detailed information for feature analysis, the gain on the system was chosen as 100x based on the healthy working condition, i.e. when coating was available. Hence, when the balls contact the races and spikes occur, the signal exce eds the DAQ board\222s margin and this result in a saturated signal          Figure 6-1 Vibration signal over a period of 2000 minutes  Figure 6-2 shows the friction data collected in the same experiment. From the friction data, we can see the evolution of bearing faults. There are fo ur stages marked as Normal Fault A, Fault B and Fault C, which are not easily observable in the vibration data shown in Figure 6-1. The challenging task is to detect these four stages from the vibration data alone. The friction data is used as the reference signal for the algorithm development only          Figure 6-2 Friction signal collected in the same  experiment and four bearing stages  Microscopic examination of the races at the conclusion of the experiment revealed meta l on metal contact. Shown in Figure 6-3, this evidence is limited to parts of the ball finger print on the race. The ball footprint as can be seen in Figure 6-3 is toward the outer edge of groove. Contrary to the ungrooved bearings, no packing effect can be seen in the turning points of the ball footprint. This is due to the fact that ball cages have 12 balls in grooved bearing contrary to 8 balls in un-grooved ones which with 30 degree oscillations cover the turning points of neighbor ball and prevent the packing  Figure 6-4 shows a close-up of the highlighted area in Figure 6-3. Delaminated plates of oxide layer are formed because of sub-surface cracks propagation. Formation and wear of oxide layer can be regarded as the major friction controlling mechanism        5-8 265\r 265 r y y y y y  013 013   G k kkkk cccc c c f f P AP AP 1

Both Shan non entropy and infinity-norm of random covariance matrix are estimated. Figure 6-5 shows the DoR measures together with the vibration data and related friction data. In this figure, the third plot shows the temporal trend of Shannon entropy and the bottom plot is the temporal trend of random covariance matrix inf-norm  It can be observed that both Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix inf-norm have accurately captured the bearing fault evolution. Alth ough the four stages are not  clear in the vibration data, they are clearly observable in the  DoR trends. Moreover, the trend shapes of Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix inf-norm are very similar which indicates that the random covariance matrix inf-norm can be used as an effective measure of randomness of random variables  Since randomness of Fault C is relatively similar to the randomness of Fault A and Fault B, we only construct three feature vectors associated with Normal, Fault A and Fault B In fact, based on tribological an alysis, the stage of Fault C is directly related to bearing failure. In other words, when the bearing is in the stage of Fau lt C, the system can no longer operate appropriately                            Figure 6-5 Temporal trend of Shannon entropy 3 rd and inf-norm of random covariance matrix bottom\imated from the vibration data \(top The four stages of bearing faults can be clearly seen in the DoR trends  Figure 6-6 shows three cluste rs in the feature space which are associated with three bearin g stages. It can be observed that these three clusters are well separated, which indicates that the features made of Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix infinity-norm can be used to identify the fault stages of the ball bearing. However, the Fault C cluster is missing, which makes it impossible to classify this stage based on clusters. In our monitoring algorithms, we use GM-HMM to infer this fault stage             Figure 6-6 Feature space with three well-separated feature clusters associated with fault modes  


   8 6.3 Fault Classification Using GM-HMM  We have applied 10% of the data shown in Figure 6-1 for the training of a GM-HMM. Three separate GM-HMMs were trained, each representing one stage  Normal, Fault A or Fault B. They were then fused to generate the final states from the complete model. We then applied all of the data including training data\o the  trained GM-HMM. The state transitions are shown in Figure 67. In this figure, the four fault states are obtained from the analysis of randomness of the signal \(see Figure 6-5                    Figure 6-7 Classification of GM-HMM using the feature space shown in Figure 6-6  From Figure 6-7, we make the following observations  1  GM-HMM made the correct transition from 223Normal\224 to \223Fault A\224. Th ere is a small transient transition period in which states \223Normal\224 and 223Fault A\224 alternate frequently. This phenomenon makes physical sense since mechanical system changes states gradually  2  After the transient tran sition from \223Normal\224 to 223Fault A\224, the bearings are in \223Fault A\224 state. As the bearings are wearing out gradually, they start a  long transition period with states varying among 223Normal\224, \223Fault A\224 and \223Fault B\224  3  Bearing stay at \223Fault B\224 fo r a long period of time  4  As bearings continue wearing out, they enter in a new state which is not modeled by GM-HMM during the training phase. One can see that the states vary between \223Fault A\224 and \223Fault B\224 Based on the tribological analysis, data in this region are associated with bearing failure or \223notuseable\224 stage. Although our GM-HMM does not provide a new state for this region of data, it can clearly be inferred through the frequent transitions between two fault states, \223Fault A\224 and \223Fault B\224  In many industrial applications, the data related to machinery failure are difficult, if not impossible, to get. It is practically important to infer the failure state using nonfailure data. The results shown in Figure 6-7 clearly indicate that GM-HMM can be used to predict bearing failures without actually using the failure data C ONCLUSIONS  We present a feasibility analysis for the development of an online ball bearing fault detection and identification method which can effectively identify va rious fault stages related to the dynamics of vibration related to the contact in the coated ball bearings. To detect the ball bearing faulty stages, we have developed a new degree of randomness \(DoR\nalysis methodology using Shannon entropy and random matrix theory. Test results have shown that DoR can be used to detect the small abnormal tran sient signals associated with the bearing friction and wear evolution. To identify the fault stages, we have further developed a set of stochastic models using hidden Markov model \(HMM\ theory. Instead of using the discrete sequences, our HMM can incorporate the feature vectors modeled as Gaussian mixtures. To facilitate online fault identification, we build a HMM for each fault stage. At each evaluation time, all models are evaluated and the final health determination is refined based on individual detections. Test results using laboratory experiment data have shown that our system can identify coated ball bearing faults in near real-time  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The work is supported by NASA STTR Phase II funding under contract NND08AA57C.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
