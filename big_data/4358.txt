due to the development of information technologies, mobile network services and application of big data.  Nowadays, ecommerce has reached a stage in which e-businesses are far beyond the online trading of buy-pay-deliver, but covers a much broader spectrum of line business activities, such as financing which indicates that e-commerce has been transited from monetary transfer to credit transfer. The financial services for ebusinesses have now incurred fundamental changes in credit risk management, with significant impacts on the traditional credit system, such as timeliness, service quality, cash flow and liquidity and scalability of services, etc.  In this paper, based on an onlinecredit scoring model, we identified important factors that improve the prediction accuracy of a credit scoring model and 
reduces the probability of default, which also demonstrated the important role of non-financial data in credit risk control in the e-businesses environment Keywords- e-commerce; credit risk management; non-financial data; financing service I  INTRODUCTION  The fast advancement of information technologies, the penetration of mobile network services, and the application of big data have been constantly empowering the growth of ecommerce since it was born in 1993. In early 21 st century, ecommerce only accounted for less than 1% of retail sales in US due to lack of sufficient trust on the Internet [1  Sin c e th en  with information technology development, consumers can 
easily get more and more information in e-commerce, which lowered their perceived risk and improved their perceived trust The enhanced trust was positively related to consumers\222 ecommerce participation, so it largely helped e-commerce development [2  Th e ec o m m e r ce v o lu m e acc ou n t e d f o r 4 of  retail sales in US in 2010 [3 In  ad d i ti o n th e em erg e n c e o f  mobile technology facilitates e-commerce conducted from a wired network to a wireless network [4   In th e l a st t w o  decades, we have witnessed how financial services, specifically e-payment services, contributed to the development of ecommerce. For example, advanced service like e-payment directly benefits e-commerce growth since it provides advanced competitive advantage for online consumers via lowering the cost of modernizing operations    
In the meantime, e-commerce has in turn rewarded the finance industry with innovative ideas and cutting-edge efinance services, which are making the e-commerce ecology more prosperous. E-finance is defined as \223the provision of financial services and markets using electronic communication and computation\224 and it mainly covers the use of electronic payments, the operations of financial services and the operation of financial markets [6 o w a d a y s  e fi na nc e ha s re ac hed a stage in which e-business are far beyond the online trading of buy-pay-deliver, but covers a much broader spectrum of online business activities, including loan, mortgages, guaranty insurance, pledge, vouch, etc. All these are credit-based indicating that the financial mechanism in e-commerce has 
been transited from monetary transfer to credit transfer. In this way, financial services for e-businesses have now heavily relied on credit risk management, the same as they are in brickand-mortar businesses The financial services in e-commerce are not just simply applications of financial services in the cyber world, but also incurring fundamental changes in credit risk management. Efinance has significant impacts on the traditional credit system such as timeliness, service quality, cash flow and liquidity, and scalability of services, etc. Although banking industry has provided online loan application service, most financial institutions still evaluate applicants\222 creditability and predict the probability of default by using official financial data and 
non-dynamic transaction information provided by applicants 7  H o w ev er in th e ec o m m er ce m ark et  th e t r an s act ion s  ar e  conducted online and could have huge changes within minutes even seconds. The information used in traditional credit risk management cannot be updated in real time. Its hysteresis makes traditional method unsuitable for credit analysis in ecommerce [8 o r ex am ple  b o r r o w e rs 222 accu rat e r e a l t i m e  credit status and business information in e-commerce cannot be reflected by financial data, which is usually updated monthly or quarterly. The disability of being dynamic may significantly influence the accuracy of credit-scoring. So the traditional method is not suitable for online-credit scoring. In addition unless provided by borrowers, the objective and comprehensive 
information about their business transactions is almost inaccessible for financing institutions, especially when the borrowers try to hide something having negative impacts on their credit. Therefore, a new method of analyzing creditability in e-commerce is urgently desired The credit risk of e-commerce mainly comes from two sources: virtual feature of the Internet and information asymmetry [9  T h e vi rt ua l fe a t u r e o f t h e I n t e r n e t m a ke s t h e traditional method of credit risk analysis ineffective in risk 978-1-4673-4843-0/13/$31.00 © 2013 IEEE 


prediction in e-commerce market. In a traditional business practice, where credit risk analysis is mainly based on financial data and conducted off-line, the process of analysis usually takes weeks or even months. However, in e-commerce transactions, rapid updating the business information makes financial institutions have great difficulties to get accurate financial information in time to analyze credit correctly Moreover, organizations in the e-commerce market, especially small and medium enterprises, have comparatively higher capital turnover than normal entity companies. The traditional financing process takes too long time to satisfy their capital demands. Therefore, financial institutions need to apply a more efficient and effective credit scoring method to satisfy borrowers\222 financing needs, as well as to control the credit risk Additionally, for commerce market, lots of prior researches investigate the factors that could help to mitigate the information asymmetry, and are mainly focused on two aspects hard credit information and soft credit information. Hard credit information is financial information, while soft credit information is defined as the non-financial data about business In this paper, we argue that not only financial data but also non-financial data should be used to evaluate credit in ecommerce market since the mature aspect of soft information for mitigating information asymmetry. Although measurable financial factors are important, it cannot represent a comprehensive picture about credit. For example, the traditional method of credit risk analysis cannot measure the social network in e-commerce market. The non-financial factors \(quality of management, market position, transaction details, etc.\ provide a deep insight into credit measurement Therefore, to control credit risk in e-commerce market, an online credit analysis system taking account of non-financial data is needed urgently, which uses dynamic data and takes both hard and soft credit information into account In this paper, we identify important non-financial factors by using a comprehensive dataset about e-commerce transactions It is provided by a Chinese network technology company who owns the most prominent B2B market in China. This research contributes to credit risk management in e-commerce by revealing the fundamental difference between online credit scoring and traditional credit scoring. It also contributes to efinance business by revealing key factors in the online credit risk analysis. And it adds to the big data application area by considering non-financial data in credit risk analysis. Finally this paper demonstrates that the e-commerce market has promising future and it\222s ready for other e-finance derivatives\222 development II  O NLINE CREDIT SCORING FOR E COMMERCE  Credit scoring is a technique that uses information collected by banks and/or other financial institutions to reduce the probability of customer default, which indicates credit risk [10  The traditional credit scoring model used to control credit risk is mainly built upon the information about an applicant\222s ability to repay, project risk, and willingness-to-pay. Firstly, an applicant\222s ability to repay is usually measured by financial data that can demonstrate his existing capital and financial status, such as the balance of checking account and cash flow Secondly, accurate prediction on project risk is essential to control credit risk. Most applicants apply for loan service because of lacking capital to run projects. Therefore, the characteristics of projects and characteristics of applicants determine the projects\222 risk. The project risk is high in both situations: people with high risk sense apply for financing a low risky project and people with low risk sense apply for financing a high risky project. Lastly, willingness-to-pay should also be included in the credit scoring model. According to the Theory of Planned Behavior \(TPB\\223people are rational individuals and behavior motive is an important basis for detection of behavior\224 [1 T h ere f or e i t  i s  po s s i b l e t h at a borrower does not fulfill debt service obligations if the perceived costs associated with repayment exceed the benefits even though he has the ability to repay  For a  s p e c ifi c  de b t  or loan, the borrower\222s willingness-to-pay largely depends on his perceived value of trust and the priority of debt. It can be perceived from the historical behavior, such as payment record default record, etc To some extent, an online credit scoring model is different from the traditional one due to its unique characteristics. For example, compared with traditional credit scoring, it is hard to obtain formal record of financial activities of a business via financial statement. However, the e-commerce platform records every single transaction which can be used as alternatives for online credit scoring. In e-commerce, credit risk management is still based on measuring the applicant\222s ability to repay, project risk, and willingness-to-pay. But the information used here is non-financial data. The e-commerce market is commonly viewed as an open community offering both opportunities and threats. Community-based reputations can help financial institutions evaluate trustworthiness in the ecommerce environment and predict community members\222 future debt behavior [1 Th u s  t h e  a p p l i c an t 222 s re pu t a t i on can  be considered as his social capital and used to demonstrate his ability to repay. In terms of project risk control, the online credit scoring model uses real-time transaction information which should be more accurate than traditional methods. Is the project common for the borrower? How is the total business situation? How big is the involved market risk if compared with other members in e-commerce market? All the transaction information is available and updated online, so the online credit scoring model is more dynamic than traditional methods. The willingness-to-pay can be seen from the historical behavior although the used information is not the same. Instead of evaluating financial data, historical records on the fulfillment of a contract, such as records of fulfillment, quality of fulfillment, and dependency on the project, are used to demonstrate borrowers\222 willingness-to-pay In 1999, Gebauer and Scharl de scr i b e d f o ur p h a s e s  i n  e-commerce transactions process: information \(seeking and collecting information\, negotiation \(establishing a contract settlement \(defining transactions\ and after-sale [15  Fr om th e  perspective of procurement, the process is divided into two phases: contracting \(sourcing and available to promise\ and settlement \(transaction and delivery\ [1   T h e s p e c i f i c activities among different phases can have some overlaps due to the different sequence of pay and delivery in online transactions. As mentioned before, the data used in traditional credit scoring model is financial data, which is mainly about 


payments. It seems that traditional method can only control risk and analyze credit in the settlement phase. However, in ecommerce, all the other phases before settlement involve credit For example, the inquiry record shows how many potential customers are interested in the product. Comparing the inquiry record with the number of successful transaction, a convert rate may indicate the probability of business success in the future and the reliability of the business owner. In the negotiation phase, if the borrower is willing to disclose his business information and commit to reinforcing the relationship with the financial institution, he shows willingness to trade and could be more trustful than others who do not have willingness to disclose [1  According to our date set, the guarantee transaction service that the financial institution provides to its B2B customers does not only deal with the lending issue, but also covers problems in other aspects, such as the buyer\222s payment issue, the quality of product/service, the timeliness of delivery, the follow-up after sales, etc. Any inaccuracy in above fields leads to lost and commercial disputes between buyers and customers in ecommerce, which will involve compensation and guarantee payment. The traditional financing method does not cover such kind of issues, so we would like to investigate some unsolved problems. For example, since credit issue exists in negotiation and contract phases, will a credit scoring model starting credit measurement from contract phase be better? To measure the credit in contract phase, what kind of indicators should be used How to do credit scoring if no financial information available To try to answer these questions, we propose some hypotheses and test them by using non-financial transaction data in the real world. We investigate the relationship between non-financial data in e-commerce transactions and default probability. We find that transparent information, willingness to disclose information and dependency on e-commerce are influential factors in e-commerce market III  N ON FINANCIAL FACTORS IN CREDIT SCORING  E-commerce platform records all the details about each online transaction except for payment information and enables the financial institution to have lots of information to evaluate customers\222 credit. Being able to use dynamic data is the unique characteristic of the online credit scoring model. Therefore, any online change can be traced and monitored. The transparent information lessens information asymmetry [18 Fo r t h e financial institution, the reduction on information asymmetry provides it with more correct data that can be used in credit scoring model to get more accurate default prediction. For the TP members, the transparency acts as an invisible power that monitors their activities and has them fulfilled debt obligations which reduce the default probability. Thus H1a. Transparent information reduces the probability of default by enable lenders to monitor borrowers\222 online activity H1b. Transparent information improves the prediction accuracy of online credit scoring model by reducing information asymmetry  In B2B market, companies do businesses online. They have the right to change settings and post some information on the website to make their products attractive. To facilitate doing businesses online, they can also disclose firm\222s information such as address, phone number, decorate website, bind telephone with website, etc. Their willingness to disclose information in e-commerce exchanges shows their trust on the website [19  Tru s t bet w een borrow e rs a n d len d ers i n crea s e s  the longer they work together [20   T h e c o o p e r at io n a l w a y s  increases with a higher frequency of contact in the relationship which indicates their business dependency on the market Attempts to reduce dependency can be seen as evidence of a lack of trust  T h e  p e r c e p t i on  of de pen d en cy  m a k e s  companies value the relationship with the e-commerce platform, which is the financial institution. Therefore, if borrowers\222 business is mainly accomplished online, they probably will not do harm to the relationship. From another perspective, the lending relationship can be considered as a specific asset. The more efforts borrowers commit to the relationship, such as pay for an annual fee and protection fun the cost is high. Therefore, if the costs associated with the breaking lending relationship are higher than the benefits, the borrowers will try to make payments on time and avoid default Thus H2a. The willingness to disclose in e-commerce exchanges increases the dependency on the e-commerce market H2b. The dependency on the ecommerce market reduces the probability of default  IV  M ETHOD  In this paper, we use a data set provided by a Chinese network technology company who owns the most prominent B2B market in China \(called as \223financial institution\224 later To promote the development of e-commerce and facilitate transactions among small and medium enterprises, the financial institution launched a program named \223TP\224 providing credit guarantee service to companies who registered in its B2B market \(called as \223customer\224 later\e credit guarantee service includes loan and guarantee payment The customers who joined the TP program are TP members and can obtain some credit grant provided by the financial institution. Meanwhile, to join the program and maintain the membership, TP members need to pay the yearly fee. It means for the financial institution, the more TP members, the more collected fee. However, it faces credit risk in this e-finance environment, such as losses if TP members do not have the ability to repay. Therefore, how to measure customers\222 credit and control the risk are big challenges The data set contains the information about 10,116 customers in the B2B market. For each customer, there are supposed to have 104 variables to describe its business characteristics, transactions, and the credit grant in the financial institution. To find out the key factors having influence on the probability of default, we use Neural Network in a data mining software SAS for regression analysis, analyzing the 


relationship between independent variables \(non-financial data and dependent variable \(the number of default\. The variables used as predictors provide a comprehensive picture about customers\222 business behavior, which can be grouped into three aspects. The first group refers to the behaviors acted by customers. Does the customer bind his cell phone to e-platform Does he log in the trade link frequently? The second group refers to the behaviors incurred within transactions, such as the transaction amount within last 30 days, the credit grant, the total number of successful transactions, etc. The last group refers to objective and stable characteristics, such as TP type TP period, and other data that may not be changed frequently In the analysis of each variable, we classified the customers according to different levels of the variable and tried to find the relationship between the single variable and the default record Then, we did group analysis by including variables with similar characteristics in credit model simultaneously and tried to find the relationship between cluster variables and default record  V  R ESULT  According to the results of regression for number of default some key factors are statistically significant \(p<0.1\. It shows that the distribution of default for TP members is much lower than that for non-TP members. And the variables related to TP program are significant in the model. TP period refers to the length of membership, which is classified as short term membership, mid-term membership and long term membership The results indicate that the length of relationship should be included in the credit scoring model, since the distribution of default for customers with the long term relationship is much lower than that for customers with the mid-term relationship and short term relationship. In addition, TP product type is also a key factors having impact on the distribution of default Customers who pay for long lending period have a strong willingness of building or maintaining the relationship, which indicate that they value their reputation and will protect it by making payment on time TABLE I  R EGRESSION A NALYSIS FOR N UMBER OF D EFAULT  Independent variable No. of Default \(p-value TP Type 0.146  0.034 TP Year 0.056  0.047 TP Product 0.029  0.10 No. of Complaint 0.095  0.054 Bind cell phone to e-platform 0.114  0.038 Decorate website 0.088  0.043 Change Company Disctionary 0.495  0.089 Issue Valid Offer 0.002  0.04 p < 0.10 TABLE II  T HE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TP  T YPE AND T HE D ISTRIBUTION OF D EFAULT  TP Type The Distribution of Default TP Type The Distribution of Default TP member 0.133 Non-TP member 0.408 TABLE III  T HE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TP  Y EAR AND T HE D ISTRIBUTION OF D EFAULT  TP Year The Distribution of Default Short Term \(1 year and less 0.99 Mid-Term \(2-4 years 0.24 Long-Term \(above 5 years 0.07 TABLE IV  T HE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TP  P RODUCT AND T HE D ISTRIBUTION OF D EFAULT  TP Product The Distribution of Default One Year 0.25 TwoYear 0.12 TABLE V  T HE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN N O  OF C OMPLAINT AND T HE D ISTRIBUTION OF D EFAULT  No. of Complaint The Distribution of Default 0 0.15 1 0.75 2 0.86 TABLE VI  T HE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN N O  OF C OMPLAINT AND T HE D ISTRIBUTION OF D EFAULT  WHEN TP YEAR IS CONTROLLED  TP Year No. of Complaint The Distribution of Default Short Term \(1 year and less  0 0.15 1 0.74 2 0.85 Mid-Term \(2-4 years 0 0.04 1 0.18 2 0.21 Long-Term \(above 5 years 0 0.01 1 0.05 2 0.06  It can be seen that the e-commerce platform contains various information about B2B customers and TP program covers more information about TP members than general customers. In other words, the data about TP members is more transparent than that about non-TP members. Therefore, the credit risk of lending money to TP members is more controllable and measurable than the risk of lending money to general customers, which supports the hypothesis H1a Additionally, one variable can be classified into different levels which enables us to do more accurate analysis. After divided into three categories according to the length of relationship customers can be further classified as groups having record of 


complaint or not.  In this way, we can find out how the number of complaint impacts the probability of default if customers have the same length of relationship. Seen from the results, the distribution of default for the customers who have length of over 5 years is much lower than that for the customers who have length of less than one year, even if their have the same number of complaint. It is obvious that the credit risk is very different between these two groups. We did the similar analysis by clustering different variables. The results of multi-level analysis show differences when compared with previous single level analysis. Therefore, the credit scoring model with transparent information can provide a more accurate prediction for customers with different characteristics by analyzing information from multiple angles. This conclusion supports the hypothesis H1b The TP members have different level of activity. Basically a B2B company will have relatively active online actions if most of its businesses are conducted online. It can be seen from the frequency of logging in, the number of feedback, the theme style, the authentication on website \(email validation and mobile phone verification\, etc. All these variables can also demonstrate the company\222s willingness to disclose. The more activity it has, the more information it would be disclose According to our results, there are some key factors that can have impact on the prediction of default. The customers who revised or decorated its website have a lower distribution of default than those do not. If the customer binds his cell phone to e-platform, the distribution of default will decrease from 0.23 to 0.16. In addition, the distribution of default can decrease from 0.46 to 0.14, if the customer changed its company dictionary. These trends support the hypothesis H2a The degree of dependency on e-platform varies among B2B companies. The willingness to disclose is also a signal of willingness to trade. The authentic information that customers input into the e-platform shows customers\222 willingness to trade and their dependency on the e-commerce market. This conclusion supports the hypothesis H2b TABLE VII  T HE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WILLINGNESS TO DISCLOS AND T HE D ISTRIBUTION OF D EFAULT  Bind Cell Phone to e-platform The Distribution of Default Yes 0.16 No 0.23 Decorate website   The Distribution of Default Yes 0.089 No 0.192 Change Company Dictionary   The Distribution of Default Yes 0.14 No 0.46 Issue Valid Offer   The Distribution of Default Yes 0.22 No 1  VI  D ISCUSSIONS   C ONCLUSION  This research makes academic contributions to online credit-scoring in e-commerce by pointing out its fundamental differences with traditional credit-scoring method and the importance of non-financial data in credit scoring. In ecommerce, the credit evaluation could start from the very beginning of the transaction process, since the characteristics in each phase can demonstrate borrowers\222 credit to some extent. Therefore, the credit ri sk in e-commerce is measured not by using the data about payment in the settlement phase but by using the transaction information in previous steps collecting information, negotiation, and contract\ addition some key non-financial factors have influence on the prediction of the credit scoring model, which has been ignored in traditional methods. This paper also has practical contributions by revealing key factors in online credit scoring and providing some guidance to financial institutions in efinance industry. According to the results, the online credit scoring model can be improved to produce more accurate prediction. There are a lot of unanswered questions about credit evaluation in e-commerce and e-finance, which leaves a wide area for researchers to discuss. In the future, the studies on credit in e-commerce could discuss deeper issues. Based on our results, it is believable that the result of prediction on default probability could be different if combining more variables as cluster variables. From other perspectives, to investigate the role of online credit scoring in e-financing area it is necessary to find more theories to support practical phenomenon. What are the fundamental differences on credit measurements between contract phase and settlement phase What kind of theories is needed to support the credit scoring model used in contract phase? With the rapid development of e-commerce, the problems with credit evaluation will become more complex. The e-commerce market has promising future and it\222s ready for other e-finance derivatives\222 development A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research has been sponsored by National Social Science Foundation of China \(11AZD077\d the grants from the Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan province in 2010, 2011, and 2012  1  S.E.

puting demands onto physical machines having heterogeneous capacities can be modeled as a multi-dimensional bin-packing problem They assume that each virtual machine comes with its failure rate i.e the probability that the machine will fail during the next time period But they do not consider that services should be duplicated on different machines to derive a robust solution The authors focus on formal speci“cations of the problems as we usually do before deriving complexity results then they show and prove complexity results For instance to prove Theorem 5.1 they use a reduction to the 3-partition problem  F or the e xperiments the y consider only machines far below our study because they say that computing the reliability of an allocation takes time  In authors study the problem of ener gy-a w are resource allocation for hosting long-term services or on-demand compute jobs in clusters They do not capture the possibility of copies but they have a constraint on the RAM available on each node The objectives and constraints lead to greedy algorithms This work is similar to our work but the main differences are that for each job allocated to a machine we must have to decide the fraction of CPU to use and we need also for an estimate of the RAM consumption of the job The fraction of CPU is for studying a form of heterogeneity but it does not include all the cases that can be derived from our heterogeneous modeling We do not model the commonly-used Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling DVFS power management technique  17 as it is no w a v ailable on most processors including processors for smartphones and tablets DVFS is able to reduce the power consumption of a CMOS integrated circuit by scaling the frequency at which it operates and when the load varies dynamically VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we explain how to optimize the energy consumption in a context where volunteers nodes are used for building a cloud Our proposal consists in two models one in homogeneous context and the other one in heterogeneous ones We then propose various experiments using Matlab for solving the combinatorial problem in order to observe the system behavior suggested by our models The simulation results show that our modeling is effective and suitable for real volunteer cloud environment For future since we need to of”oad the copies of applications to various machines with different availability patterns we should also consider more realistic issues including the performance and user experiences on the devices network latency and data transportation and communication time We can also use a weighted objective function for energy consumption and other performance overheads like application migrations The network-dependent factors have signi“cant impact on user-perceived performance of the hosting applications The network communications also consumes lots of energy The cellular connectivity is one of the biggest contributors of energy consumption in a smartphone The task af“nity and QoS guarantees are also important in real volunteer cloud environment VII A CKNOWLEDGMENT The funding supports of this work by Natural Science Fund of China No 61003077 Natural Science Fund of Zhejiang Province Y1101092 and Research Fund of Department of Education of Zhejiang Province No GK100800010 are greatly appreciated In France this work is funded by the FUI12 Resilience project from the ministry of industry R EFERENCES  Jean-P aul Smets-Solanes Christophe C  erin and Romain Courteaud SlapOS A Multi-Purpose Distributed Cloud Operating System Based on an ERP Billing Model In Hans-Arno Jacobsen Yang Wang and Patrick Hung editors

We now evaluate the overhead of the FChain system Table II lists the CPU cost of each key module in FChain We observe that most modules in FChain is light-weight The most computation-intensive module is the abnormal change point selection component which is triggered only when a performance anomaly occurs F Chain also distributes the change point computation load on different hosts and executes them in parallel to achieve scalability The online validation takes about 30 seconds for each component since we need some time to observe scaling impact for deciding whether we have made a pinpointing error However the online validation is only performed on those suspicious components pinpointed by the integrated fault diagnosis module The FChain daemon running inside the Domain 0 of each host imposes less than 1 CPU load and consumes about 3MB memory during normal execution IV R ELATED W ORK Our work is rst closely related to previous black-box fault localization schemes F or example NetMedic p rovided detailed application-agnostic fault diagnosis by learning inter-component impact NetMedic rst needs to assume the knowledge of the application topology To perform impact estimation NetMedic needs to nd a historical state that is similar to the current state for each component However for previously unseen anomalies we might not be able to nd a historical state that is similar to the current state for the faulty components Under those circumstances NetMedic assign a default high impact value whic h sometimes lead to inaccurate diagnosis results as shown in Section III In comparison FChain can diagnose previously unseen anomalies and does not assume any prior application knowledge Oliner et al proposed to compute anomaly scores using the histogram approach and correlates the anomaly scores of different components to infer the inter-component in”uence graph As shown in Section III it is dif“cult for the histogram-based anomaly detection to perform online fault localization over suddenly manifesting faults Moreover unrelated components can have indirect correlations caused by workload uctuations which will cause their system to raise false alarms In comparison FChain is more robust to different types of faults and workload uctuations To achieve black-box diagnosis researchers have also explored various passive network traf“c monitoring and analysis techniques such as Sherlock  O ri on 27 S N A P  28 However those analysis schemes can only achieve coarsegrained machine-level fault localization Additionally during our experiments we found that previous network trace analysis techniques cannot handle continuous data stream processing applications due to the lack of gaps between packets for extracting different network ows Project5 and E2EProf performed cros s correl a t i ons bet w een mes s a ge traces to derive causal paths in multi-tier distributed systems WAP5 e x t e nds t h e b l ack-box caus a l p at h a nal y s i s t o support wide-area distributed systems Orion di s c o v e rs dependencies from network traf“c using packet headers and timing information based on the observation that the traf“c delay distribution between dependent services often exhibits typical spikes LWT propos ed t o di s c o v e r t he s i mi l a ri t y of the CPU usage patterns between different VMs to extract the dependency relations hips between different VMs However as shown in our experiments dependency-based fault localization techniques are not robust which can make frequent pinpointing mistakes due to various reasons e.g the back pressure effect in distributed applications common network services pinpointed as culprits Furthermore existing dependency discovery techniques need to accumulate a large amount of trace data to achieve reasonable accuracy Particularly network trace based techniques only support requestand-reply types of applications which fail to discover any dependency in continuously running applications such as data stream processing systems In contrast FChain provides online fault localization which does not require any training data for anomalies or a large amount of training data for normal behaviors FChain is fast which can quickly localize faulty components with high accuracy af ter the performance anomaly is detected A urry of research work has proposed to use end-to-end tracing for distributed system debugging Magpie  i s a request extraction and workload modelling tool that can record ne-grained system events and correlate those events using an application speci“c event sch ema

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
