1 Introduction 
A critical factor of success in todayís governments is to effectively communicate their messages to citizens and build strong alliances with them by empowering their participation in the decision making process. Some countries have established promising e-Government initiatives with the objective of enhancing the accessibility of government services and information for their citizens. Since e-government can improve government management efficiency, it is very important 
to improve the public service by the publicís need to e-governmentís development  However, the e-government website design mainly concentrates on website features that would enhance its usability with the government centric approach. The governments tend to design and launch online services based on their understanding of what citizens need without actually measuring what increases citizens willingness to adopt the e-Government services E-Government services should be the maximum from the needs of the public, based on the interests of the public as the center design services, and improve 
service efficiency, reduce service costs, improve service quality, providing the public with the largest service efficiency Government public services need to attach importance to the principle of demand-oriented and then carry out all system construction and services work. To achieve this goal, government institutions and the public must be interactive with information on the public information needs and study the real need of public This process needs to do the public opinion collections However, such the user feedback commonly is containing a big text data from diversity of the citizens 
The big data of the userís feedback is about turning imperfect, complex, often unstructured data into actionable information. This implies leveraging advanced computational and analytical tools such as text mining tools, to reveal trends and correlations within and across large data sets that would otherwise remain undiscovered This study proposes an application of Topic Models to do analysis of the big text data of the e-Government userís feedback The topic models are a popular method for modeling the term frequency occurrences in text documents. Based on the qualitative analyses approach 
the study analyzes userís opinion and recommendation to the e-Government services. The paper also describe designing evaluation sheet, data collection and analysis strategies of a case study in e-Government portals evaluation The study of this project aimed primarily to investigate the effects of cultural, soci al politic situation and other country-specific factors on the development and diffusion of e-government. Specifically, the project aimed to Providing a model of evaluation for e-government

3.2 Topic Models for Text Mining 
reflect the needs of the citizens 3 How do the peoples fell about the utilization of e-Government services Many studies were conducted to evaluate e-government provision of services through the Web Those studies generally fall in two categories, those that borrow lessons and suggestions from the evaluation of the web characteristics with contents of services and performance approach; and those that concentrate on the characteristics of the web with web structural and network analysis approach. Both of the categories are focusing on measuring the rating of services to evaluate the website source, services and/or characteristics of the web An evaluation model based on a rating of services and user needs/expectancy to evaluate user satisfaction of resources and services are never used in those studies The work of Wood et al s a s t u d y  t h at  t ri e s t o  utilize lessons and ex periences from evaluation of a web site services performance. The authors suggested use of a multidimensional Web evaluation strategy, which includes methods such as usab ility testing, user feedback usage data, and Web and Internet performance, etc. that are common in the evaluation of commercial Web sites A study of Wang et al w a s aim e d t o dev e l op an d evaluate a model for e-government services that focuses on how characteristics of si te interact with both the services and citizens to influence the efficient delivery services. It was also aimed to help answer why a government websites designed to be citizen-centric in service delivery succeeds or fails. A research was done by Wangpipatwong et al i s a s t u d y t o i n v e s t i g ate  factors that influence the adoption of e-Government websites directly from citizens. This work typically focused on characteristic of information quality and system quality of the e-government websites. The authors suggested that characteristics of information quality significantly influence the adoption of the e-Government websites. The study concluded that efficiency accuracy, relevancy and completeness are more significance factors than timeliness and precision of the information in the e-Government websites. The work of Hasigawa et al [4 i s  a ty p i c a l  s t u d y t o ex am in e the e-government progress level based on questionnaire survey. The authors suggested use three progress levels input, output, and outcome\ measuring the e-government achievement. The authors considered that the progress level is high with achieving the outcome Those studies are focusing on measuring the rating of services, without evaluate user needs/expectancy to the resources and services Researches by Kojima et al, and Patricek et al represent the second approach to evaluation of e-Government Web sites. The work of Kojima et proposed a method of websites grouping based on link structure in order to compose the whole structure of a site by considering semantically related pages as one virtual document. The work of Patricek is a s t u d y th a t  tries to improve e-Government evaluation using arrange of techniques from web metric and social networks analysis. The authors examined two forms of structural characteristics of the websites: internal structure that is indicative of navigability of a site, and external structure that is indicative of hubness and authority of a site Above studies are focusing on measuring the characteristics of the web with web structural and network analysis approach, without evaluate user needs/expectancy to the services This paper presents a case study of Indonesian central government institutional e-Government services. Studies regarding Indonesia e-Government evaluation are still rare e A u th or f o u n d a f e w res earch  s t u d ies   Research performed by Sarosa e v a lu ated th e lev e l o f  e-Government adoption in Yogyakarta. Another research study was performed by Wahid to evaluate the content focus and quality of e-Government websites at the districts/cities level  u thor also already conducted previous study to evaluate the status of development and information quality and services, user preferences and behaviors of the Indonesia central governmentís e-Government portals [10, 11, 12, 13  H o w e ve r   information regarding user preferences and actual factors improving user to access the e-government services is very important but currently still not clearly understood This study presents an evaluation based on a quantitative analysis approach of the Indonesian central government institutionís e-Government services Topic models are a probabilistic generative model for discrete data, where each user has a probability distribution of selecting each topic, and each topic has a probability distribution overall data An early topic model was proposed by Hofmann w h o dev e l oped probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis \(LSA Blei et al 16 intro d u ced L a tent Dirichlet A llo catio n \(L D A  model which is a Bayesian mixture model for discrete data where topics are assumed to be uncorrelated. In LDA, the generation of a document collection is modeled as a three step process. First, for each document, a distribution over topics is sampled from a Dirichlet distribution. Second, for each word in the document, a single topic is chosen according to this distribution. Finally, each word is sampled from a multinomial distribution over words specific to the sampled topic The Correlated Topics Model \(CTM is an extension of the LDA model where correlations between topics are allowed  Topic models have previously been used for a variety of applications, including information retrieval 18  geographical information retrieval d an aly z ing log data of human behavior such as web usag  news article reading  w e l l as pu rch a si ng beh a v i or

 T h i s s t u d y propos es an a ppl i cat i o n of T opi c Model s to analyze of the big text data set of the userís feedback The general research framework of this study adopted a problem-based research cycle presented by Levy, et al  L e vy  s re s earch c y cle a res earch e n deav or m i gh t  best be viewed as a structur e that incorporates a number of distinct but related elements, including the research problem that drives the research, along with the goals research questions, literature review, methodology results, and conclusions. The research problem serves as the starting point for the research, and is a unifying thread that runs throughout all of the elements of the research endeavor. Research goals essentially detail what the research study intends to do in order to address the problem, thereby answering the question: ìWhat will this study do Figure 1 shows the general framework of this study. To achieve the study goals described in Section 3, this study addresses the indicated research questions \(Section 2 This study employs both qualitative and quantitative data analyses to produce and explore new findings Qualitative analysis and litera ture review is conducted to support and validate all of the issues This paper presents an evaluation based on the concept of a public value methodology for e-Government portal evaluation. This concept is a new approach for performing an analysis and evaluation of governance quality. The key points of this concept were developed in the mid-90 T h i s con c e p t t a k e s i t s root i n pu bl i c  administration practice, as a basis for monitoring the efficiency of administrative reforms and the development of public service quality standards. Such purposes are perhaps most clearly identifiable in respect of universal entitlements such as health, education housing and sanitation, personal security, and justice Moore argues that public values must relate to citizens desires and perceptions One of the modern applications of this concept is the analysis and evaluation of various services and tools of governance quality improvement. Today, one of the most effective tools of government quality improvement is the development of e-Government. The Author has adapted and extended this concept to address e-Government, with application to the case study of Indonesia The Public Value can be defined as the value created by government activities, and the added value arising from these activities can be interpreted as the difference between the benefits received from and resources given to the government by society In mapping the territory of what it is the public value, Kelly et ti fy th ree  categories; \(1\ublic services, \(2\ublic policy outcomes, and \(3\blic trust. By these three elements the public value concept is closely interrelated with the good governance principles developed by the United Nations, and also with the governance quality criteria used by the World Bank to calculate GRICS Governance Research Indicator Country Snapshot indices The public value concept enabled an analysis and systemization of the characteristics used by different researchers to evaluate the level of development and quality of e-Government portals, which resulted in the specification of five major indicators for assessing regional government portals [2 1  p e nne ss  2   Transparency, \(3 teractivity, \(4\n-centricity and \(5\ability. The Author has adopted and extended this concept to ev aluate e-Government in Indonesia  Figure 1: A General Research Framework The study mainly used three types of data collections e-mail, online website, and in person interview. Online data collection was undertaken trough mailing list of Indonesian societies, and government institution websites. In-person interview was conducted to the citizen in some area of Indonesia \(Jakarta, Bandung Surabaya, Malang, Gresik, Yogyakarta, Balikpapan Samarinda, Makassar, etc The online data collection took place between the beginning of August 2012 and the end of December 2012. The data collection in some internet cafÈs started on 10 August and finished on 25 August 2012.

Table 1 illustrates statistical characteristic of the collected datasets. After the questionnaires have been completed coded paper questionnaires are entered into Excelís CSV spreadsheet. The respondentsí ID, Age and opinion data are entered into first, second and third column of the sheet. We used Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox \(TMT\orm analysis of the collected datasets that have substantial textual component 27  The Stanford TMT provided some features that give ability to do Topic Models Analysis, and the study utilized the following features 1 Importing text datasets from cells in Excelís CSV spreadsheets 2 Using LDA model to create summaries of the text datasets 3 Selecting parameters for training LDA model such as the number of topics, number of top words in the each topic, filtering most common words and selecting the column containing the text datasets   4 Slicing the LDA topic models output and converting it into rich Excel-compatible outputs for tracking word usage across topics and respondent categories Figure 2 shows script source used to train the LDA topic model The data was imported from a CSV file with name ìsurvey-data.csvî. The program is set to read terms with more than 4 characters, because some terms and conjunctions commonly used in Indonesian language wrote in 3 or 4 alphabet characters. For example me you be-,that and The number of topics was set to categorize the datasets into three topics. Table 2 shows a summary of the topic model after finishing the data training. The table represents the top-ten terms in the each topic Table 3 shows how many times the terms of topic have occurred in the each group of respondents Figure 2 A part of scripts code and its parameters for the LDA topic model analysis Table 2 A summary of the top-ten terms in the topics

Figure 4 Characteristic of the proportion of each topic in the group of the respondentsí age category The result on the table 2 shows that the respondents feel that the e-Government services should make benefit for citizen. In this analysis, the datasets were categorized into three topics. Base on the summary of the top-ten of most frequency occurred terms in each topic, terms of the topic 0 represent the importance of providing online services and database The topic 1 shows the identification of need to provide up to date information from the government institutions and the importance of public opinion gathering. Topic 2 indicate that the e-government services should provide information of economy and business circumstances such as economic indicators, the governmentís regulations on such businesses, opportunities for investor, bidding information and online transaction Base on the ratio of the topics, 55.9% of the documents is close to the co ntent of the topic 2. Its indicate most of the respondents feel that the e-government services should provide online transaction services and up to date in formation related to the economy and providing information of business chance with the government institutions. The topic 0 was described in the 33.9 % of the documents The importance of providing online services and database was represented in the one-third of the respondents opinions. Only 10.2% of the respondents opinion said the importance of providing the most up to date information of government institution activities and the necessity of the concrete ac tions to provide public opinion gathering services through online public forum and a consultation service corner for citizen  Table 4 and Figure 4 illustrate the characteristics of the each group of respondent category to choose a topic for their opinion on e-Government services The respondents with a group of younger than 20 years old and between 21 to 31 years old make their opinion choice to the topic 2 The result indicates that most of young respondents want to take economically benefit on e-Government services like utilization of online transaction for effectiveness of the government services The middle age respondents made a trend to choose their opinion to the topic 0 Around 80% of the middle age and 67% of the old age groups argued about the providing an online services and database on the e-Government services is very important Only 20% of the middle age and 32% of old age respondents feel the importance of providing online transaction on e-Government services It can be said that the middle and old age groups of citizens suggest providing online services and database in the administration processes of government institutions The LDA topic models can be used to assist an analyzing of a big text datasets of the citizens opinion and recommendation to identify and find out quickly the point of what citizens recommended in. The citizen recommendation can be indentified from the categorized topics and most frequency occurred terms in the each topic. The data analyses of this case study was used a number of parameter to categorize the topics into three different topics More than th ree topics categorizing is also needed to be analyzed and compared with each others By slicing the topics and the groups ID, The LDA topics models also can identify the characteristics of the each group of the respondents The study experimented to show the characteristics of each group of respondentsí age category with their proportion in the each topic The experiment shows that the different of the trend in each group of respondents can be shown clearly In this study, the category of age was divided into only five groups. To analyze and show much more precisely the characteristics, it is needed more specific age categories Identification of the characteristics of the citizens opinions and recommendation is also needed on various type of groups of citizens such as area that the citizens live in, education income, type of internet connection, and so on The government should do frequently evaluation of what are the servi ces needed To improve the usability accessibility, and effectiveness of e-Government services for citizens it is necessary to conduct the servicesí impacts evaluation, periodically The resulting gathered information represents important feedback and opinions from the users. The e-Government website developers will then need to reflect such feedback in the redesign and reengineering of e-Government services. To make much clearer the current status of e-government services and its impacts for the citizen, author consider that it is necessary to conduct other studies with different frameworks and parameters, such as level of infrastructure, users terminal system, internet providers access speed, scale of database, category and type of contents released, web user interface and so on It is also required to conduct analyzing some factors with broader socio-economic framework such as social status and demographics parameters

Query performance and scalability of our approach are reported in Fig 3 Queries and were in the category and had basic graph patterns with one triple pattern Both and yielded larger results compared to other queries returned all graph identiìers in a dataset e.g 100,000 triples for and 500,000 triples for  and returned all triples in a particular provenance graph e.g returned around 400 triples for each dataset Even though these queries were the simplest queries among the UTPB test queries they showed to be more expensive due to larger result sets which is especially evident for query  the only query whose performance was on the order of seconds In the case of both and  which involved no joins the major factor in query performance is the transfer time of nal query results to a client machine and it is hardly possible to achieve better performance on the given hardware By contrast all other queries performed on the order of tens of milliseconds required joins and returned subsets of triples in a particular provenance graph  400 triples Queries were in the category and dealt with various dependencies among artifacts and processes in provenance graphs They all had similar complexities basic graph patterns with three triple patterns each They also returned comparable result sets in terms of the number of triples except query that returned an empty result set for the selected UTPB provenance graph template As a result these queries showed very similar query evaluation performance with being the fastest as it only required the evaluation of its rst triple pattern to compute the nal empty result Queries and were in the category and dealt with data artifacts in provenance graphs contained six triple patterns and two clauses had triple patterns two clauses two and one constructs is the most complex query of all yet it was shown to be efìcient and scalable with our approach The last two queries and  were in the category and dealt with processes in provenance graphs had two triple patterns and one clause While is a complex query with triple patterns and one clause it yielded an empty query result in our experiments due to the selected provenance template In summary the proposed approach and its implementation proved to be efìcient and scalable showed linear scalability and took the most time to execute due to a relatively large result set The other queries showed nearly constant scalability technically linear with a small scope This can be explained by the fact that each query except  dealt with a single provenance graph of xed size with minimal data transfers and fast index-based join processing VI C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we studied the problem of storing and querying large collections of scientiìc workîow provenance graphs serialized as RDF graphs in Apache HBase We designed novel storage and indexing schemes for RDF data in HBase that are suitable for provenance datasets Our storage scheme takes advantage of the fact that individual provenance graphs generally t into memory of

a single machine and require no partitioning Our bitmap indices are stored together with graphs and support both selection and join operations for efìcient query processing We also proposed efìcient querying algorithms to evaluate SPARQL queries in HBase Our algorithms rely on indices to compute expensive join operations make use of numeric values that represent triple positions rather than actual triples with lengthy literals and URIs and eliminate the need for intermediate data transfers over a network Finally we conducted an empirical evaluation of our approach using provenance graphs and test queries of the University of Texas Provenance Benchmark Our experiments conìrmed that our proposed storage indexing and querying techniques are efìcient and scalable for large provenance datasets In the future we plan to compare our approach with other SQL and NoSQL solutions in the context of distributed scientiìc workîow provenance management as well as experiment with a multi-user workload to measure query throughput of our system R EFERENCES  Y  Simmhan B Plale and D Gannon  A surv e y of data provenance in e-science
