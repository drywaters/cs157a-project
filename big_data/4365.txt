the illuminated part of a shallow-junction photodiode and its series resistance 12 3 41 This relation creates an expectation for a big variation of the response time the time for which the photo-generated charge will be removed from the photodiode with the illuminated spot size This is because the time constant of the photodiode which is one of the main factors defining the response time is a product of the series resistance multiplied by the junction capacitance 
In this work the dependence of the charge removal time of a shallow photodiode on the size of the illuminated area is studied Simulation results as well as measurement data show that the response time is changing only slightly with the position and the size of the illuminated spot size when very short light pulses are used After the incidence light is over the discharging of the photodiode continues with a time constant which is highly 
independent of the size and the location of the illuminated part of the photodiode Key words radiation detector deep ultravioletlextreme ultraviolet response time series resistance I INTRODUCTION R ecently the demand for radiation detectors in the spectrum range bellow 200 nm has noticeably increased For example the ever decreasing feature size of the projected on silicon wafers patterns has led to the development of deep ultraviolet DUV 1 93nm and extreme ultraviolet EBU 13,5nm lithography 
The metrology and the dose control of the DUV/EUV pulsed sources require the use of fast and sensitive DUV/EUV radiation detectors Photodiodes are good candidates for this type of applications Due to the decreased penetration depth of EUV and especially DUV radiation in silicon the depletion zone of the photodiodes where the photo-generated charge is collected has to be made very close to the surface 1 Further the electrode can not cover the active surface of the photodiode because it 
will absorb the radiation incidence Instead it is located at the edge of the active area and is often called ring electrode As a result of this the photo-current which removes the photo-generated charge from the depletion zone travels through a thin top layer with a relatively large sheet resistance In fact the series resistance of shallow photodiodes is dominated by the resistance of this thin top layer The series resistance of the photodiode is of importance because it forms a time constant together 
with the photodiode junction capacitance posing a lower limit to the response time of the photodiode Recently reported research shows that the series resistance of the photodiode will be affected by the size and the location of the illuminated area 2 This has led to the concern that the response time of the photodiode is also affected by the size of the illuminated area In order to optimize the design of the readout circuit for DUV/EUV photodiode we need to know its worst case response time For this reason

a study of the response time of shallow-junction photodiodes is carried out Next in the paper we present II an electrical model of the photodiode and SPICE simulation results of the photodiode response time III these simulation results are compared with the simulation results from a FEM simulation IV finally an experimental test set up is presented together with the achieved experimental results and conclusions are made V,Zf Figure 1 Photodiode readout circuit 1-4244-1541-1/08/$25.00 IEEE

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services.
