Initially developed in the scope of Simbol-X  a C N ES form at i on fl y i ng i n st rum e nt  where time-tagging of data science from three detectors is critical to perform on-board processing, the extension can be implemented in all equipm ents where the use of the performing SpaceWire standard is not possible due to its intrinsic synchronization limitation. This limitation gives a lack of precision ten times the data transmission period rate 
plus two periods of the receive r synchronization clock. With the additional feature this uncertainty is reduced to two periods of the receiver synchr onization clock. The extension takes advantage of already existing capabilities of the SpaceWire standard with no impact on the data layer and very limited additional resource needs.

I NTRODUCTION   Simbol–X is a hard X–ray mission, operating in the 0.5 70 keV range, which is proposed by a consortium of European laboratories for a launch around 2013. Relying on two spacecrafts: the mirror and detector \(as sketched on Figure 1\n a formation flying configuration, SIMBOL–X uses a 20 m focal length X–ray mirror to achieve an unprecedented angular resolution \(20 arcsec HEW\ and sensitivity in the hard X–ray range. Simbol–X will allow to elucidate fundamental questions in high energy astrophysics, such as the phy 
sics of accretion onto black holes, of acceleration in quasa r jets and in supernovae remnants, or the nature of the hard X–ray diffuse emission In order to provide detection over the energy range within required resolution and taking into accounts possible detectors candidates, a configuration with two detection layers has been chosen: the focal plane detector system combines a Silicon low energy detector, efficient up to 20 keV, on top of a Cd\(Zn\gh energy detector. An active anticoincidence shield surrounds them except for the solid angle corresponding to the focused beam from the 
mirror \(see Figure 1 detector is to reject events induced by interplanetary charged particles interacting in the imaging detectors environment. In order to co mply with the limited spacecraft to ground telemetry bandwidth the discrimination shall be  Figure 2- Instrument interface architecture  Figure 1- Simbol-X formation flying 


  2 done by the flight hardware. Discrimination is achieved by performing time correlation betw een anticoincidence events and detectors events. Discrimination performance is expressed in term of dead time for the whole instrument which is an input from scientific requirements. In turn this dead time defines the time tagging resolution and accuracy of the various detector event time tagging. Therefore for the Simbol-X instrument an accuracy of 100 ns is required. The interface architecture of the instrument is depicted in Figure 2: the three detection sub-sy stems are interfacing with the Data Processing Unit \(DPDPA\eans of 3 SpaceWire links. For clock distribution purpose the detection subsystems act as destination nodes while DPDPA acts has the transmission node. In the next part of this paper we will focus on the SpaceWire standard Time-Code use limitation and improvement 2  S PACE W IRE STANDARD   The Time-Code is used to support the distribution of system time across a SpaceWire network. A Time-Code is formed by an ESC control character followed by a single datacharacter as shown in Figure 3   3   As specified in EC  when t h e i nput  si gnal  TICK_IN is asserted and th e link interface is in the Run state it shall cause the transmitter to send a Time-Code immediately after the current character has been transmitted Therefore the delay between the moment of TICK_IN assertion and the receiver d ecodes the Time-Code depend on the type of the current character transmitted and its transmitted state. The shortest delay occurs when the current character is an ESC one and its transmission is about to end. The worst delay is when current character is a Data Characters that has just start being transmitted. Best and worst case timings are represented in Figure 4 If the time tagging in SpaceWire node is done by incrementing a time counter with a valid Time_Code transmission, the resolution depends on the TICK_IN frequency. This frequency shall be lower than 1/30th of the transmission frequency in order to be able to transmit something else than Time_Code. For example a transmission frequency of 100 MHz allows a time tagging precision of about  300 ns for a TICK_IN maximum frequency of 33 MHz An alternative to increase time tagging performance is to synchronize a free running counter in the destination nodes with the TICK_OUT signal. The improved time tagging accuracy depends now on the free running counter frequency and the TICK_OUT skew, which is  13 periods of transmission clock. For example with a transmission and free running counter frequencies of 100 MHz the best achievable time tagging accuracy will be around  140 ns The TICK_IN frequency will be chosen in order to minimize the impact of the frequency stability of the free running counters Unfortunately none of the above solutions is suitable for the Simbol-X instrument where an accuracy of 100 ns is required and transmission frequency is limited to 40 MHz due to FPGA performance and margin due to derating rules applicable to space borne electronics   Figure 3 - Data Control Characters and Control codes  Figure 4 – Best and Worst Time-Code transmission delay 


  3 3  S PACE W IRE EXTENSION   The SpaceWire standard encoder-d ecoder is divided in three main functions: a transmitter, a receiver and an initialization state machine The extension to the standard is relying on two new functions that aim   To measure the time delay between a send Time_code request \(following a TICK_IN signal assertion\he effective Time_Code transmission start in the transmitter. Counting the number of rising edges of the transmission clock during this delay does this measurement. Then as soon as the main Time_Code is transmitted a second one is sent carrying the delay measurement This second Time_Code is identified by a specific Time_Code by means of two Control_Flag \(T7T6\ 0-1 while the lower four bits carry the content of the time delay counter    In the receiver when a Time_Code is received Time_out display the Time_Code. If the Time_Code is valid 4  t h e TIC K _OUT si gnal  is asserted. Then if the ne xt received character is a Time_Code and its Control_Flag are 0-1 then the four lower bits are used to get a constant and known delay between the Time_Code sent request and the TICK_OUT negative edge. Otherwise the TICK_OUT is set to 0 after a constant number of periods of clock recovery  To illustrate the benefits of the additional functions the remained of the paper will present resulting performance on the basis of a simple test configuration of simultaneous Time_code transmission toward two SpaceWire nodes Figure 5 With the proposed extension the TICK_OUT of both nodes fall synchronously as shown by the timing diagram in Figure 6. The skew between destination nodes TICK_OUT falling edges depends on propa gation delay mismatches which could be calibrated and corrected as well as the total delay with the TICK_IN rising edge The time tagging now can be generated in different ways Two of them are described below In the first method the time tagging generation is done with a counter that is incremented by the destination node SpaceWire clock recovery and load on TICK_OUT falling edge. This method has the advantage that all the destination node clocks recoveries are related to the same clock from  Fi g ure 6  Time code transmission  Figure 5 – Block diagram of the tested configuration 


  4 the transmission node. Then receiver nodes are immune to local clock mismatch and drift. The time tagging relative accuracy is equal to two transmission clock periods However a drawback may limit the use of the method: when an error occurs on one of the SpaceWire link, the corresponding node lost this time tagging synchronization with other nodes until it receives a new TICK_OUT falling edge In the second method the time tagging generation is done with a counter that is incremented by the destination node host clock and loaded on the TICK_OUT falling edge. In this method as destination node host clocks are independent the TICK_IN frequency shall be chosen in order to limit the effect of the host clocks differential drift. Thus with the proper choice of the TICK_IN frequency the highest time tagging relative accuracy may be as low as two host clock periods 4  I MPLEMENTATION  The block diagram of the SpaceWire and the proposed extension is given in Figure 7. Added functions are the Time_TX” and “Time_RX” functions. No modification of the SpaceWire standard core is required except the Ack_Time signal, which is added to the “Tx” function and used by the new “Time_TX” function. Note: to be able to implement this extension, access to time_code acknowledgement signal and recovery clock is needed Footprints of the additional functions are given in the Table 1 when targeted to XILINX SPARTAN and ACTEL SX devices and VHDL synthesi zed using SYNPLIFY PRO Target FPGA Area footprint TIME_TX Area footprint TIME_RX XILINX SPARTAN3S400 LUTs: 21 LUTs: 38 ACTEL RTSX-SU72 Combinational Cells 20 of 4024 \(< 1 Sequential Cells 16 of 2012 \(1 Combinational Cells 42 of 4024 \(1 Sequential Cells 26 of 2012 \(1 Table1 – Extension footprints If used as a time receiver from a standard SpaceWire it will behave as any others SpaceWire receiver as long as two time_codes are not send consecu tively. In that case the second will be used as a time correction and won’t be transmitted to host If used as a time master with a standard SpaceWire receiver to avoid time_code misleading the time_code correction shall be disabled or the host shall be able to discriminate between default time_code \(Control_Flag = 00\ime correction time_code \(Control_Flag = 01\e: only the use of the null time_code flag is defined, all other codes being reserved for future us es in the present standard specification [1  This extended codec is therefore fully compatible with the standard SpaceWire codec  SpaceWire encoder-decoder Tx Rx State machine Din Sin Dout Sout EnRdRx DataRx FifoEmptyRx FifoRx DataTimeOut TickOut Clock recovery ReqNcar AcqNcar Ncar Req_Time Acq_Time TimeCode EnTxClkIn EnWr Data FifoFull Time_TX Tick_In Time_In Time_Rx Time_Out Tick_Out Reset Rxclk AutoStart LinkStart LinkDisable RunStatus HostClk Clock management En10MClk EnTxClk HostClkValue  Figure 7 – Extented SpaceWire block diagram 


  5 5  N ETWORK   This extension can also be used in a SpaceWire network The same time-code distribution rules shall be followed   The only specific point is to transmit the valid time on the falling edge of TICK_OUT in order to get the full benefit of the extension  Thus with this extension th e accuracy with which system time can be distributed is still dependent upon the number of links over which it is distributed and the operating rate of those links. But now the delay is constant with at least 38 bit-periods \(data character ESC + data character + ESC data character = 10+4+10+4+10\s encountered for each link that time-code traverses. This delay is defined by design in the TIME_RX module to N > 38. Therefore the time-skew across a network is  T skew  N/A i  Tp i  1  Where Ai is the link SpaceWire i operating-rate and Tpi is propagation delay across the SpaceWire link i. This timeskew could be calculated or calibrated depending on the need of the application. Jitte r is introduced at each link by the synchronization of the TICK_OUT by the host clock Finally the total jitter is  T jitter  2*Phost_clk i  2  Where Phost_clk i is the period of the link i host clock For a network with 10 links at 100 Mbits/s, all host clocks at 100 MHz and N = 40, the time skew is 4 µs and the jitter 200 ns. All the time-skew can be corrected on each link with a time sub-counter The time accuracy across a network depends principally on synchronization jitters Using PLL to generate the host clock could increase accuracy  The following figures illustrate the time-code distribution and sub-time counter setting principle The initial state of the network is shown in shown Figure 8 The dotted lines represent the SpaceWire links between routers and nodes. N1 is the time master; the two numbers in the node and router boxes represent the time-counter and sub time-counter. In this example the time-counter unity is 1000 times the sub-time-counter unity  Figure 8 – Initial state of the network  When TICK_IN is asserted in node N1, its time-counter is incremented to 31, the sub-time-counter is reset and a timecode 31 is transmitted \(Figure 9   Figure 9  TICK_IN asserted  The transmitted time-code is received by the router R1 which checks that the time value is one more than its timecounter. Then on its TICK_OUT falling edge it increments its time-counter, sets its sub-time-counter with the transmission delay and sends out time-code on all other links \(Figure 10  Figure 10  Router R1 forwards time-codes  The transmitted time-code is received by N2 and N3. Each node checks that the time value is one more than its timecounter. Then on its TICK_OUT falling edge it increments its time-counter and sets its sub-time-counter with the transmission delay \(Figure 11  Figure 11  Destination nodes receive time-codes 


  6 6  R ESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS   Prototypes of both transmitte r and destination nodes have been developed with XILINX SPARTAN FPGA: a PCI SpaceWire board simulates the transmitter node while 2 detector acquisition boards simulate the destination nodes  The detector acquisition boards normally triggered by   are triggered in this test configuration, by an external function generator, which simulates simultaneous photon hits on the two detectors. On each trigger the acquisition el ectronics generated of time tagged event to the PCI / SpW board. The TICK_IN signal is generated internally to the transmitter node; its frequency being set by software. The presented results are measured with TICK_IN running at 1 kHz  First timing measurement on this prototype is shown in Figure 13   The upper trace \(yellow the TICK_IN signal of the transmitter and the two next traces \(Red and Green\are TICK_OUT signals of the two destination nodes. The rising edge of the TICK_OUT signal is not re-synchronized and then a large jitter of almost 160 ns is measured. This jitter corresponds to what could be obtained with a standard SpaceWire. The falling edge of the same signal is resynchronized with our extension. The resulting jitter is as low as about 4 ns and is due to cables length and propagation delay mismatches  The performance improvement shall be also demonstrated by checking the time tagging of the events. Several configurations have been successively tested in order to compare the performance of our extended SpaceWire core with respect to the standard SpaceWire core combined with the two ways to generate the time tagging in the destination node The first configuration is for a standard SpaceWire operation \(synchronization of time tagging counter on the rising edge of TICK_OUT  In this configuration the time tagging counter is incremented by the SpaceWire link recovered clock \(from the data transmission with a rate of 50 Mbits/s\e time tagging jitter in this configur ation is 200 ns \(see Figure 14 This result is compliant with the timing of the figure when considering the rising edge of the TICK_OUT. Due to limited data transfer in both directions we don’t reach the absolute maximum expected from Figure 4 \(300 ns  In the second configuration the SpaceWire is operated with our extension \(synchronization of time tagging counter on the falling edge of TICK_OUT\his configuration the time tagging counter is incremented by the SpaceWire link recovered clock \(from the data transmission with a rate of 50 Mbits/s Figure 12  Test configuration block diagram  Figure 13  TICK_IN vs TICK_OUT Timing  Figure 14  SpW std and local clock 


  7 The time tagging jitter of the configuration is 40 ns \(see Figure 15\. This result is compliant with the timing of the Figure 6 when considering the falling edge of the TICK_OUT  The third configuration is for a standard SpaceWire operation. In this configuration the time tagging counter is incremented by the local \(100 MHz\ock.The time tagging jitter of the configuration is around 300 ns \(see Figure 16  The fourth configuration is a SpaceWire with our extension operation again. In this configuration the time tagging counter is incremented by the local clock \(100 MHz The time tagging jitter of the configuration is around 30 ns see Figure 17 This configuration gives the best time tagging resolution This is due to the very low differential drift of the destination nodes \(100 MHz boards, which is less than 10 ppm     To confirm this hypothesis, another measurement was made this time with a TICK_IN period of 100 ms \(see Figure 18 The saw tooth is due to the drift of the host clock between within the TICK_IN period. The result shows that oscillators have a differential drift of about 5.6 ppm. The two small windows of the Figure 18 show that the error remains in range of 40 ns for the few first milliseconds following a re-synchronization   Figure 16  SpW std and clock recovery Figure 15  Extended SpW and clock recovery Figure 17  SpW extended and local clock Figure 18  Extended SpW and local clock 


  8 7  C ONCLUSION   We have demonstrated the benefits of the high-resolution extension to the SpaceWire st andard. Initially limited to 280 ns we are able now to ach ieve an accuracy of the time tagging of 40 ns, which represent a gain by a factor of 7 When in free running counter configuration highest time resolution could still be achie ved even with low SpaceWire data rates. In that case the time resolution is dramatically increased with our extension with respect to the standard e.g. the gain is 35 for a data rate of 10 Mbps and a 100 MHz free running counter. As mentioned the footprint of the extension stays very limited which allows an easy implementation in any space FPGA. Such an extension combines the benefits of the SpaceWire standard and highresolution time tagging without the need for another dedicated interface for cloc k and synchronization signal distribution In the Simbol-X instrument, the TICK_IN period is one second and the transmission frequency 20 MHz. Each node will use its clock recovery to increment the time tag counter The time tagging jitter will be th en of 100 ns which is fully compliant with the requirements The proposed extension may open the SpaceWire standard to new fields of application where high timing performances are needed R EFERENCES   ire: Links, Nodes, Routers and Networks European Cooperation for Space Standardization, Standard No. ECSS-E50-12A, Issue 1 January 2003   Ph Ferrando and al SIM B O L-X m i ssi on overvi e w proc.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.

Flash will be available at 512 Gb per die [9 Table  5 highlights the number of die necessary of three discussed technologies to achi eve a recorder of specified capacity in the timeframe given Table 5 - Minimum Device Count by Technology to achieve a Data Recorder of Specified Capacity in the Year shown.  \(Example, a 30 Tb recorder being designed in the year 2020 would require 468,750 CRAM devices or 1,875 NROM devices, or 118 Flash devices  Therefore, a 130 Tb data recorder designed using devices predicted available in the year 2030, would require the following number of devices \226 not including any additional devices used for Error Detection and Correction \(EDAC\ or sparing and word control 200  CRAM: > 1 million devices Year Recorder Capacity CRAM 4Mb NROM 1Gb Flash 16Gb 720,000 2,880 180 64Mb 16Gb 256Gb 468,750 1,875 118 128Mb 32Gb 512Gb 1.02E+06 4,063 254 Required Not Reqiured Required EDAC Technology / Device Capacity /Chip Count 2010 2020 2030 2.88 Tb 30 Tb 130 Tb 


 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.  It is important to note that this may not be the prime candidate, but was chosen for known characteristics Selection of a more appropri ate EDAC code [2 w oul d  most assuredly, bring about a reduction in recorder mass and power One final, important, distinction between the two prime technologies is required The NROM devices analyzed for this paper have built-in an incredibly powerful error detection and correction machine, capable of detecting four bits in error in a single word, and correcting three bits per word [10  W i t h th is m e th od t h e Bit Error Rate is calculated by the manufacturer to be less than 1.18E 19  errors/bit-day \226 equivalent to 3 unrecoverable bit errors every 550 years for the entire recorder; therefore, the package numbers presented here do not include extra devices required for EDAC other than that provided by the chip itself Table 6 - HC-SSR Basic Features 200  Redundant SpaceWire interfaces 200  Redundant Power Converters 200  Redundant Controllers/Supervisors 200  Multi-plane Non-volatile storage 200  Error detection and correction 200  Device isolation to the EDAC Word  Figure 18 - HC-SSR Conceptual Block Diagram

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.  In the figure, nearly two hundred 2-Gbit NROM devices are installed on each face of the 9U card.  \(The whitespace is preserved in this example for passive components and design margin.\e time of this writing, the availability of chip-stacked NROM devices was uncertain and omitted from the trade space Design of a Flash-based memory card would be of similar ilk.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
