212 face recognition; infrared images; intervals\222 number; lattice computing; orthogonal moments I  I NTRODUCTION  The problem of human face recognition has attracted a lot of attention in various applications including video surveillance 1  h u m an m ach in e in ter act i o n  2  c o m p u t er v i s i on  3   etc   Even though successful results have been reported extensively the proposed systems are, in general, characterized by a 
remarkably poor performance under different illumination conditions. Note that \223illumination\224 as well as \223occlusion\224 constitute significant difficulties for face recognition especially in non-structured environments A promising approach for face recognition, especially under varying illumination conditions, is based on thermal infrared images. The latter images represent a face temperature distribution, that is an advantage for both illumination-invariant and robust-to-occlusion face recognition, even in the dark [4   Despite the potential advantages of temperature patterns in face recognition problems, the high cost of infrared cameras has 
discouraged the widespread use of thermal images in the past Nevertheless, the ongoing growth of the semiconductor industry has resulted in an affordable drop of infrared cameras\222 cost as well as an increase of microprocessor speed towards enabling the proliferation of thermal infrared images in human face recognition applications of scale This work proposes a human face recognition system that carries out the following four information-processing tasks 1. Image acquisition, #2. Face localization, #3. Feature extraction, and #4. Classification, as described next The \223image acquisition\224 task #1 is carried out by the camera hardware without any user intervention. The remaining 
three tasks are carried out by user-designed software. More specifically, the \223face localization\224 task #2 carries out stable  or, equivalently robust face localization in the sense that it clearly separates the face from the background on an image The \223feature extraction\224 task #3 is carried out here using orthogonal moments [5   6  To t h e bes t of ou r  k n o w l ed g e   this is the first time that orthogonal moments are employed with thermal infrared images, in particular for human face recognition. Finally, the \223classification\224 task #4 is carried out using techniques from the lattice computing framework outlined next Lattice Computing \(LC\ was initially defined as \223the 
collection of Computational Intelligence tools and techniques that either make use of lattice operators inf and sup for the construction of the computational algorithms or exploit Lattice Theory for language representation and reasoning\224 [7 R e ce nt  work has extended the meaning of LC to denote \223an evolving collection of tools and methodologies that process lattice ordered data including logic values, numbers, sets, symbols graphs, etc\224 [8 LC t e c hni q u es ha ve  b e e n used succ e ssful l y i n  a number of applications including robot localization [9   industrial dispensing [1  s t r u ctu r e i d en tif ic ati o n   1 1  s h a p e

features. The reported experimental results are promising More specifically, the proposed methodology achieves clearly higher classification rates compared to alternative classifiers from the literature The paper is organized as follows. Section II details the proposed face recognition methodology. Section III presents experimental results comparatively with alternative methods as well as alternative feature extraction techniques from the literature. Finally, section IV concludes by summarizing our contribution and discussing potential future work 


212\212    2 is the n  m  th order geometric moment of the M II  T HE P ROPOSED M ETHODOLOGY  The proposed methodology carries out three informationprocessing tasks, namely face localization, feature extraction and classification, as described in this section A  Face Localization As soon as a thermal infrared image is acquired, the human face is localized in order to remove irrelevant image content This step is crucial because it specifies the part of an image where features are to be computed during subsequent steps Would the aforementioned image part include either irrelevant or trivial content then face recognition might deteriorate significantly, even fail Face localization on conventional images is typically carried out either by the Viola-Jones face detector [18 or by  alternative face detectors from the literature. However, the aforementioned solutions typically fail with infrared images due to the high textured nature of the thermal infrared images More specifically, the aforementioned detectors work well with face images where the eyes, mouth and nose regions are clearly discernible. Nevertheless, the situation with a typical thermal infrared face image \(Fig. 1\ is quite different Taking into account the aforementioned difficulties, a new face localization method is proposed here, especially for thermal infrared face images, in five steps 1  Image Conversion to Gray-scale The acquired image coded in the RGB color space, is converted to gray-scale format. Such a conversion removes useless color information by transforming temperature distribution to texture. In particular, the following formula is employed Gray-scale = 0.2989*R + 0.5870*G + 0.1140*B 2  Image Binarization The gray-scale face image, produced in the previous step, is converted to a binary image towards separating the foreground \(useful face information\ from the background \(useless information\ In particular, the Otsu binarization [1 m e t h od i s a p pl i e d t o c a l c u l at e a  suitable threshold value which is then used to produce the binary image by hard thresholding   Fig. 1  A typical thermal infrared image of a human face  3  Morphological Opening and Center of Mass Computation  The binary image of the previous step is morphologically opened by applying erosion, followed by dilation morphological operators [2 t o w a r d s r e m o vi ng i s o l a t ed image parts. The structure element is selected big enough so as to retain only the human face part of the image. Upon successful completion of the opening operation step, only a single segment of the initial binary image remains. Then the center of mass of the aforementioned binary segment is computed by geometrical moments techniques [2 ng the following formulas 10 01 00 00 and  GM GM xy GM GM  1 where 327 N pixels face image f  x  y  n and m are nonnegative integers, i.e n  m 327 128 pixels Fig. 2 displays the output image after each one of the above five steps, respectively, for the infrared face image in Fig.1. In conclusion, the output of the \223face localization\224 task #2 is a face region where redundant information \(e.g., background hair, body torso, etc.\ has been removed B  Feature Extraction We have engaged a feature extraction method on a thermal infrared image localized face so as to achieve dimensionality reduction while, at the same time, preserving discriminatory face characteristics. Therefore, we carried out feature extraction by computing orthogonal moments on a cropped face image \(Fig.2\(e\\. We remark that orthogonal moments are known image descriptors, especially effective in pattern recognition applications, with a capacity to encode image content with minimum redundancy  We experimented with two families of moments, namely Zernike moments \(ZMs\and Tchebichef moments \(TMs defined in the continuous and discrete coordinate space respectively   22   11 00  MN nm nm xy GM x y f x y 002 0,1,2,\205 4  Ellipse Masking The center of mass computed in the previous step is used as the center of an ellipse masked on the face region. We remark that the major and minor axes of an ellipse are selected by trial-and-error. Note that since all human faces share a similar \223oval\224 shape, masking the face with an ellipse discards irrelevant face parts such as hair, ears, etc 5  Face Cropping The image region, already masked by an ellipse in the previous step, is used to select the corresponding part from the original face image. The latter part is finally cropped towards using it for feature extraction. The size of a cropped image is 128

The lattice order relation in F is defined as    0,1  n and 004 are the min and max operators, respectively A strictly-increasing, cumulative real function 0  327 2 size matrix. This is, potentially, a very useful property for the IN representation because it provides a fixed size \223meta-representation\224 for any data vector x length. In other words, a single IN can represent any data population. Therefore, INs emerge as an instrument for dealing with big \(numeric\data including satellite data [24  as w e ll a s  multi-dimensional data [25  No t e th at an  IN r e p r es en ts all  order data statistics [8 1 0 1 1 The representation of a distribution of data samples \(e.g image moments\ by an IN enables the employment of established, useful mathematical instruments for measuring a distance as well as for calculating a \(fuzzy\egree of partial order of different data distributions    1 3    2 3   2  LC-Minimum Distance Classifier \(LC-MDC A traditional minimum distance classifier \(MDC\gns a testing data sample S e class k  ented by a prototype pattern  k P such that  k P corresponds to the minimum distance; symbolically    arg min  k k kD i s tPS f   6 where P k is the prototype pattern of class k and Dist is a distance function that quantifies the \223apartness\224 of P k and S  In our computational experiments below, both a class prototype pattern P k and a testing data sample S are in the Cartesian product F N where F is the lattice of INs.

Our proposed algorithms were implemented in software on the MATLAB platform executed on an Intel Core i5-2410M with 2.3 GHz CPU as well as 8 GB memory A  Benchmark Dataset The Terravic Facial IR benchmark dataset [26 w as u s ed t o  evaluate the performance of alternative pattern recognition schemes. Since this dataset includes images of 20 persons with a variable number of images per person, a subset of this dataset was employed. More specifically, 70 images were selected randomly for each one of the first 10 persons resulting in a total of 700 images. The images are in 8-bit format with 320 r b\003\b are strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, respectively.

The remaining experimental settings were defined per case, as detailed below C  Comparative Experimental Results In order to evaluate the capacity of our proposed LC-MDC classifier we carried out a number of comparative computational experiments with alternative feature descriptors as well as with alternative classifiers  Fig. 3  Sample images from the Terravic Facial IR benchmark dataset a\rson #1.  \(b\rson #2.  \(c\ Person #3.  \(d\ Person #4  First, regarding alternative feature descriptors, we considered Local Binary Patterns \(LBP\, that is a popular texture descriptor used in facial recognition applications [2    29   M or e s p ec i f i c a l l y   he r e w e use d L B P de scr i p t or s fo r the temperature distribution on infrared faces. Note that LBP descriptors are typically employed in the literature in two different configurations including, first, the entire image and second, nonoverlapping blocks covering the entire image; in the latter case LBP histograms of blocks are concatenated resulting in a single histogram, namely LBP-C. In addition, we considered ZMs as well as TMs feature descriptors. Overall the feature vectors for comparison included moments ZMs \(36 features - up to order 10\, moments TMs \(36 features - up to order 5\, uniform LBP \(59 features\ and LBP-C texture descriptors computed in a neighborhood of radius 1 and 8 samples. Note that each image was partitioned in four 64 327 64 pixels size blocks resulting in 59 327 4 = 236 features Second, regarding alternative classifiers, we considered  three versions of the MDC classifier using three different distances, namely Euclidean  Chi Square 2  and Manhattan  respectively, defined as follows Euclidean Distance  212 ps  11 Chi Square 2  Distance  212 ps  13  We remark that \(11\ - \(13\ measure the distance between two vectors  p   s in the space   2 2 1  n ii i ii p s d p s  123  n s ss s    2 1 1  n ii i dps  123    n p pp p  b\003\b v and   327\003\b NN d FF is given by  b\003\b v and  


Third, regarding alternative classification methodologies we considered additional face recognition schemes, as explained below, whose application on the Terravic Facial IR dataset has been reported in the literature [28   3 0    In our classification experiments, the first image of each person in the dataset was used as a training datum, whereas all the remaining images were used as testing data. Hence, 10 feature vectors \(prototypes\ were used as \223training exemplars\224 whereas the remaining 690 feature vectors were used for testing. Regarding, in particular, the LC-MDC classifier each feature vector was represented by a single IN The recognition performance, that is the percentage of correctly classified sample images over the total number of sample images for testing are summarized in Table I, for all feature descriptors as well as for all MDC classifier types Table I demonstrates that moment features produce better classification rates \(between 2% - 11%\ compared to LBP features, for all MDC classifiers. Moreover, the combination of moment features with LC-based MDC using INs outperforms any other classifier. In particular, Tchebichef moments \(TMs produce the best classification result \(94.74%\ outperforming by over 7% alternative MDC schemes. Note that the optimal parameter values in \(10\, that produced the best classification rate \(94.74%\ in Table I, were A   1.197, 0.025, 10.00 D  Additional Experiments Given the superiority of the TMs features as demonstrated above, we further studied how the number of \(moments features effects the classification performance of the LC-MDC To this end additional experiments were carried out for TMs features and the LC-MDC classifier. In particular, TMs moments of order up to 1 /2 /3 ... /10 were computed resulting in \(order+1 2 number of features in each case. Then the TMs moments were used to recognize th e same faces as in the above experiments. The corresponding recognition rates for each TMs feature vector length are summarized in Table II Table II demonstrates that the length of the feature descriptor vector may have a significant impact on the recognition capability. More specifically, Table II shows that an optimum vector length of 16 TMs feature descriptors produces 95.43% recognition rate; that is a performance slightly higher \(around 1%\hich also corresponds to less than half the length of the best performing descriptor length \(36\ in Table I. We point out that our interest is in both effective feature descriptors and small length towards achieving high classification rate with low complexity E  Discussion Table III displays results by alternative face recognition schemes from the literature as well as the aforementioned best 95.43% performance of the proposed LC-MDC classifier. In particular, in [3 a  rec o g n i t i o n pe rf orm a n ce of  8 5  h a s  be en  reported on the same dataset using Center of Gravity \(CoG points as features and a conventional MDC. Whereas, in maximum recognition accuracy of 94.11% has been reported using LBP or Haar wavelet features with PCA and either a Neural Network \(NN\ a conventional MDC on a subset of the Terravic Facial IR benchmark data set Extensive computational experiments here have demonstrated that the recognition performance clearly depends on the selected features as well as on the selected metric of a MDC classifier. A study of the free parameters including the variable\ength of the feature vectors might result in an improvement in classification performance. Nevertheless, such a study is beyond the scope of this work. Therefore, fixed feature vector lengths have been considered here   TABLE I  C OMPARATIVE R ECOGNITION R ESULTS  Feature Descriptor Vector Length Classifier Type   MDC LC-MDC   d 1 d 2 d 3  LBP 59 77.28 84.29 82.71 75.71 LBP-C 236 82.71 85. 43 83.57 83.43 ZMs 36 88.00 87.72 88.14 90.71 TMs 36 87.43 86.86 87.43 94.74   TABLE II  R ECOGNITION R ESULTS   F OR D IFFERENT L ENGTHS OF THE TM S F EATURE D ESCRIPTOR  Order Vector Length Recognition Rate 1 4 78.71 2 9 88.43 3 16 95.43 4 25 93.14 5 36 94.74 6 49 93.14 7 56 85.00 8 81 82.71 9 100 80.29 10 121 87.00   TABLE III  C OMPARATION W ITH O THER S CHEMES  Method Features Type Classifier Type Recognition Rate  o G M D C 8 5   LBP & PCA Wavelets & PCA MDC NNs 94.11 Proposed TMs LC-MDC 95.43  


IV  C ONCLUSION  This work has demonstrated promising experimental results regarding the application of LC classification techniques for human face recognition based on orthogonal moments features induced from thermal infrared images. More specifically, we recorded a clearly higher classification performance of our proposed techniques \(TMs combined with LC-MDC compared to the performance of alternative schemes. We attribute the success of our proposed classification scheme to the synergy of INs, which can represent all order data statistics with orthogonal moment descriptors Future work plans include, first, a study of the effect of various parameters of our proposed classification scheme second, the effect of varying environmental conditions \(such as illumination\ and, third, an extensive comparison with alternative classifiers from the literature. Additional plans include \223big data\224 applications, where INs may represent large data populations 25  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work has been supported, in part, by the European Union \(Social Fund\ and Greek national resources under the framework of the \223Archimedes III: Funding of Research Groups in TEI of Athens\224 project of the \223Education & Lifelong Learning\224 Operational Programme  R EFERENCES  1  S.

The qualitative evaluation was instructive for: a establishing priorities for close processing \(those action items with confidence score =1\\ reducing unnecessary redundancy, c\ informing a deeper understanding of the contents of the archive and d\ indicating what needs to be refined in a next iteration of the algorithm. The exercise of reviewing three sets of clusters took a total of ~8 hours. Not only did this ìdistantî method speed up the process of reviewing and tidying the archive in comparison to reviewing the collection item by item, it also provided significant insight into the formation process and embedded meaning in the collection. Th e curator noted that actions could be determined after close processing of the cluster results, including directives like ìdelete directory,î ìmerge with directory Y after deleting duplicatesî, or ìleave as is VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  As a preliminary attempt to apply general ER framework and techniques in the realm of collection curation, our initial efforts focused on practical benefits for a specific collection Many aspects of this presentation are specifically tied to the test collection and utilize heuristics from that collectionís curator. On one hand, this is necessary due to a lack of prior knowledge or prior models applicable to this problem. On the other hand, the heuristic knowledge, such as series distribution and customized tags lists, simplify the computations and the complexity of the processing workflow. Still, we think that using ER as a framework for data curation processes is a viable approach that can be generalized to other collections with additional learning methods to improve its robustness and effectiveness There is an important part missing from the work presented here, namely the scope of the results in relation to the entire collection. Understanding how complete is the representation provided by the distant processing is not yet possible because there is no suitable benchmark set Creating such a benchmark is not trivial, but is something we will strive for in future work In the future, we want to investigate what kind of results might be produced by further modifying the algorithm as a consequence of observations during the first clustering iteration evaluation and of the emergence of new requirements as the data are cleaned, reorganized, and filtered. We also plan to visualize the cluster review process including other metadata such as identical checksums, and file format identification that can help the curator validate his cluster evaluation and improve action decision making A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  Funding for this work was provided by grants from the National Archives and Records Administration and the Packard Humanities Institute R EFERENCES  1  R  S e rlen  Th e Di s t ant F u tu re?
