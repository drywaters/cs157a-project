For all cities are constructed on geological objects the support of Urban Geology is necessary for urban development, and urban geological information has irreplaceable basic role for rapid development of mega-city regions There is an increasing requirement for the intellectualized integrated multi-dimensional and quick-response geological safety supporting system for mega-city regions \(GSSSMR\ based on the technologies of large spatial databases GIS virtual reality and networks etc meeting the need of guaranteeing geological resources and geological environment safety, and urban planning construction management mitigating and preventing disasters etc After analyzing the requirements of geological information and GSSSMR, we introduce the architecture of GSSSMR. At last based on the research in this paper the development and applications of GSSSMR in Beijing, China are presented en-US Keywords-mega-city mega-city regions geological safety quick-response en-US I  I NTRODUCTION  en-US Cities in China have achieved an unprecedented development in recent years. Up to 2011, the urban population and urbanization rate have reached 691 million and 51.27 respectively [1   I t is  th e f i r s t tim e th at th e u r b an iza ti o n  b r o k e through 50 line And this has formed several mega-city regions with the population of 120 million such as Hong Kong Shenzhen Guangzhou region [2   en-US For the impacts of information technology, communication technology and capital flows there is more essential element and economic centralization in  mega-city regions compared with other small cities. And China has approved a development plan of 14 regions such as Pearl River Delta Beibu Gulf Hainan International Travel Island etc According to the predication of McKinsey Global Institute [3   u r b an  p o p u la ti o n  in China will reach 1 billion, and more than 221 cities will have a population of over a million by 2025   en-US Although mega-city regions have become important engines for promoting economic growth and social development with the significant large-scale economy and po pulation cluster effect, there occur more and more geological problems in  utilization of urban land resource development waste disposal environment protection and natural disaster prevention en-US The fact that cities are built on geological objects determines that urban development is closely connected with the basic support of Urban Geological Survey UGS Up to now lots of cities in China have carried out UGS  and accumulated lots of data in basic geology, engineering geology hydrogeology geochemistry and geological disaster etc  However the huge potential value of geological data has not been fully exploited. In this case, the quick response GSSSMR  taking advantage of the latest achievements of modern information technology such as huge spatial database, GIS, 3D visualization and internet, is extremely urgent for guaranteeing geological resources and geological environment safety and realizing sustainable development en-US II  T HE R EQUIREMENT A NALYSIS OF G SSS MR FOR M EGA CITY R EGIONS  en-US Mega-city regions are the new urban models emerg ed in the early 21st century Specifically Mega-city regions are comprised of a series of 20 to 50 cities which are separated from themselves and connected with their function 4   T h ey  gather around the one or more large central cities and show great economic power by the new division of labor function  en-US Cites is the most active regions of economic activity. Urban geological data, as the important achievement of UGS  are the necessary basic information for urban planning construction management mitigating and preventing disasters They have  the following characteristics en-US S upported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No. 41202238/40742015\, China Postdoctoral Foundation \(No. 20060400348  


en-US  Multi-element  Th is characteristic can be divided into three subtypes. Multi-resources  Compared with other geological investigations UGS may mostly have a higher degree of exploration and accumulate more geological data. These data include both original data such as drill data geophysical exploration data geochemical exploration data and interpreted data such as cross-sections, geological maps. Multi-format Considering the data storage formats there are numeric data, maps, documents, pictures, images, etc in the modeling. Multi-type: 3DUGMS include spatial data, property data and textures etc. They are located aboveground or underground Natural and man-made models are all included en-US  Multi-thematic The data in 3DUGM are collected from diverse thematic areas such as bedrock hydrogeology engineering geology geochemistry geophysics, geological disasters, stratigraphy, etc. The independent and integrated representation and analysis of each thematic data are all needed en-US  Multi-dimensional The 2.5D DEM data 3D geological structure models 3D geological property models and even the 4D dynamic models, for example dynamic representation of underground water level change, all occur here en-US  Multi-scale For different applications with different data accuracy, UGS is concerned with different scale data. For example, large scale models are necessary i n the construction engineering, while small scale models may be enough in urban planning en-US  Massive Data: For the storage of 3D information, data quantity here, often up to TB, is often more than that in 2D GIS The ability of managing and operating massive data is needed en-US  Complex data association Complex data association is common in urban geological investigation data, for example several samples or tests may be referred to one field investigation point en-US The rapid development of the mega-city region s ha s led to more serious resources and environment problems with the following features compared to the small cities en-US  As construction projects become extremely active in mega-city regions the forward-looking geological information are urgently required for set selection  construction management of some major projects such as new regions subways and intercity highspeed rail, etc en-US  Some related issues in  mega-city regions are more prominent  Firstly the more dense population leads to more severe effect of the geological disasters and environmental pollution As a result  the additional geological work are required, such as the geological hazard risk assessment dynamic monitoring and real-time forecasting and warning of land subsidence active fault landslide and groundwater etc The second is the solid waste disposal site section For en-US example domestic wastes in Beijing in 2009 ha ve  reached 6.69 million tons The amount is so much that the landfill site has to be chosen carefully for the worry of water soil and air pollution Thirdly the evaluation of groundwater resources and the emergency water source selection should be strengthened. Lastly as land resources are becoming scarcer it will be inevitab le  of the exploitation and utilization of underground space in the mega-city regions en-US  In mega-city regions more effective and refining management is  needed And scientific and technological means such as IT will be utilized to achieve the quick response of the geological information services and sharing en-US  For there are more qualified personnel in mega-city regions  public will have more requirements for the geological information sharing such as the periodic bulletins of urban geological environmental quality en-US  Urban geological data center which is responsible for the collection, integration and management of the multi-element heterogeneous and mass geological data, are required more urgently en-US In summary GSSSMR an organic part of Digital City aims to build an intellectualized, integrated, multi-dimensional and quick response urban geological safety supporting information system for satisfying urban planning, construction management mitigating and preventing disasters etc These features can be summarized as follows en-US  An efficient management platform for the gathering searching  compiling and updating of multi-themes multi-elements heterogeneous and mass urban geological data en-US  An intelligent visualization and quick response decision platform for urban planning construction management, disaster prevention and reduction en-US  A geological data publishing and sharing platform for the enterprises and public en-US  A comprehensive research platform for professional geologists en-US III  T HE A RCHITECTURE OF G SSS MR  en-US  platform, in which all the diverse urban geological data can be displayed and analyzed in a unified virtual view regardless of their themes data formats and storage positions etc And in this platform urban geological data can be transformed into urban geological information and then urban geological knowledge, and finally the great value for urban development en-US The development of GSSSMR is a systematic engineering with the concern with hardware, software, talent, standards etc There are six main parts in the architecture of GSSSMR \(Fig 1 en-US  Support system Support system includes the infrastructure of networks, hardware, support software

en-US For there are many different applications and decision support subsystems in GSSSMR it is necessary to extract the common functions in the various subsystems to build the bas ic  support platform And data management geological thematic map production, 3D geological modeling and visualization geological data processing and output etc are all included in this platform based on the integration of the 2D GIS and 3D GIS en-US  Mega-cit y geological safety application systems The application systems provide fast intelligent decision support and sharing services functions based on the basic platform  professional evaluation model and 3D geological models What s more for the wide applications the application systems can be divided into several thematic subsystems for example significant engineering project geological safety system And comprehensive analysis system can be conducted based on these thematic subsystems  In addition different sharing services are provided for enterprises  institutes and pub lic  with the concern of information access right en-US The construction of GSSSMR is a huge systematic engineering, overall and stepby step plans are all needed en-US A  Mega-city Geological Data Center en-US Due to the geological complexity and multiplicity of the mega-city regions the investigation content includes many subjects such as hydrogeology engineering geology geochemistry geological disasters stratigraphy and geomorphology etc And the investigation methods include geology drilling geophysical exploration geochemical exploration, remote sensing, test and computer, etc. In addition the range of data includes ground underground and aboveground A special data center is needed for manage and analyze these complex big data which is the data base for GSSSMR. What s more it is necessary to make standard and divide these data into basic geographic data, field investigation data dynamic monitoring data result data and metadata in order to manage them effectively en-US Mega-city geological data have obvious thematic classification and subordinate relationships, and can be divided into spatial data and property data Spatial data are used for describing the location geometry and topologic relationships of geological objects and phenomena while property data are used for describing the quality or character of geological objects and phenomena For the long geological processes geological objects and phenomena have complex shape and spatial relationships. Property data important results from the tough filed investigation and laboratory tests have the same significance with spatial data Urban geological data are obviously different from geographic data for the complicated relationships between spatial data and the existence of massive property data Integrated storage and management of spatial data and property data can be achieved by the object oriented method in which the association relationships are established by defining the primary key fields [5  6  In addition it s better to develop a data access middleware between mega-city geological databases and software. This can provide users with  about the data location, storage modes and data structures, etc en-US 3D geological models data also need to be stored into databases However at present databases which support 3D spatial data especially 3D geological model data are quite limited, and specific data structure and data engine are needed to be developed [5  6   3 D s p a tial  d at a o r g an iz ati o n  an d  s p at ia l  index should also be fully considered [5  6   en-US B  Mega-city Geological Safety Supporting Basic Platform en-US Mega-city geological safety supporting basic platform provides the basic software functions for GSSSMR. It includes the following modules en-US  Data acquisition and collection All the acquired and collected urban geological data can be classified arranged and collected in digital way and standardized Data importation and transformation functions are also included in this module en-US  Data storage and management It provides a unified software environment for the editing centralized management and search for different kinds of data such as maps tables and documents Timely accurate and dynamic data updating is assured in this module en-US  Thematic map compilation Thematic maps such as cross-sections stratum histograms isoline maps statistical charts, can be created, edited and outputted conveniently en-US  3D modeling and analysis This module provides quick construction convenient editing and clear visualization of 3D urban geological models in a 3D scene And the common spatial analyzing assessing and assistant decision-making tools such as model splitting from any position directions and angles excavation simulation isoplane creating are all included en-US  Information publishing It provides a unified internet portal for the sharing and online web services of urban geological data and information en-US  Platform maintenance User management authority management, operation monitoring and fault recovery etc. are included in this module en-US Mega-city geological safety supporting basic platform can be developed based on the integration of 2D GIS and 3D GIS with the consideration of table processing virtual reality information security technologies etc. There are strong spatial correlations in mega-city geological data GIS is suitable for organizing managing and visualizing these massive multithematic and dynamic data and provides strong spatial analyzing functions with the saved topological relationships 2D GIS widely applied in many fields has relatively strong versatility while 3D GIS is not so common and is independently used in different fields for the complicated 3D data models building methods and analysis Therefore the integration of 2D GIS and 3D GIS is one available choice in the development of urban geological information management

In addition, to conform to the habits of geologists graphical guide interface will be used when the related data and system functions are accessed en-US C  Mega-city Geological Safety Supporting Application Systems en-US The application systems which include professional analysis and assessment models  3D  geological model s and application subsystems are based on the basic platform It is also a software system that can provide information sharing and decision-making assistance for governments   en-US 1  Professional analysis and assessment models en-US One important objective of GSSSMR is to provide geological evidence for assessing the urban comprehensive bearing capacity of resources and environment This can be achieved by analyzing and mining the investigation data and their characteristics creating the assessment factors system choosing quantitative or semi-quantitative assessment methods and assessing the geological resources safeguard and geological environment quality with cutting-edge technologies and systematic knowledge en-US  ls include the models for geological hazard risk assessment underground space development and utilization groundwater environmental quality assessment surface water environmental quality assessment soil environmental quality assessment land suitability evaluation, geothermal resource assessment, and the comprehensive assessment of mega-city geological environment and urban ecological environment etc At the same time the dynamic monitoring models of groundwater land subsidence, active fault and landslide, etc. should also be included for the mega-city resource and environment safety assessment and warming en-US All these models could be effectively stored and managed by creating a mega-city geological analysis and assessment model database in which the modes can be conveniently modified and updated Furthermore third-party assessment software interfaces should also be provided in the system for the better opening en-US 2  3D mega-city geological models en-US 3D mega-city geological models including 3D geological structure models 3D geological property models 3D underground buildings and structures DOM Digital Orthophoto Map\ and DEM \(Digital Elevation Model\, etc., are used for describing the terrain, underground geological stratum and structures human engineering activities in urban areas These models can give a clear and integrated 3D display of aboveground and underground natural and man-made objects and reduce the blindness in geological cognition and the risk in mega-city planning, design and construction en-US One of the important features and complexities of GSSSMR is to build links with mega-city 3D geological models such as 3D structural model of bedrock geology Quaternary Geology the 3D structure of the model the engineering geological 3D structural model, 3D attribute model of engineering geology hydrogeology 3D structural model hydrogeological 3D attribute model The further 3D visualization, spatial analysis and application needs to create a suitable geological model with appropriate precise. In addition due to the complexity of the relationship of geometry and topology uncertainty and information incompleteness and complex processing algorithms features of geological data, 3D mega-city geological models is a bottleneck for the development and applications of the system [7-10   Du r in g  t h e construction of urban 3D geological model, researchers have to focus on multi-element data multi-method integration and automatic-semi-automatic modeling, etc [11   en-US 3  Multi-thematic application subsystems en-US Based on the needs of mega-city geology safety, the related application subsystems is to be created, such as the subsystems for dynamic monitoring of geological hazards major engineering geological safety assessment underground space development and utilization and comprehensive analysis of mega-city geology safety etc And the related application subsystems should be firstly constructed for solving the urgent problems facing in mega-city regions en-US D  Beijing Geological Safety Supporting System B gsss en-US As the rapid increase of the population more than 20 million now and accumulation of varies functions in Beijing there are many geological problems such as groundwater resources shortage land subsidence dynamic faults and groundwater pollution etc The safety of geological resources and geological environment has increasingly become the bottleneck for the sustainable development of Beijing en-US Based on the shortage of energy and strategic resources and the active, hidden  unexpected and non-normal natural disasters  Beijing Geology and Mineral Exploration and Development Department provided the  engineering and one-system plan  in  the Beijing Eleventh Five-Year geological exploration and development plan. In other words, they include the protection engineering of important strategic resources land groundwater shallow geothermal energy and underground space resources  the urban geology security engineering and BGSSS And BGSSS is the core of Beijing Digital Urban Geology en-US Based on the Beijing 3D  Geological Survey Project the first stage project of BGSSS has achieved the construction of basic platform including the functions of massive and multielement geological data collection and management thematic map compilation 3D geological modeling and visualization information publishing, and platform maintenance, etc. As with the professional analysis and assessment model, the monitoring of land subsidence groundwater and shallow hypothermia as well as groundwater flow model and simulation have been initial ly  achieved There are 55,003 field investigation points  25,000 drill data and 200 thematic result maps in the constructed Beijing comprehensive geological database en-US Furthermore 3D geological models of the bedrock strata the Cenozoic strata and engineering construction layer in Beijing have been built based on the idea of point  line  surface  solid with a clear display of spatial structure and association relationships of different geological objects An information hall with hundreds of square meters, equipped with 3D visualization devices, was also put into use. The application of the system is shown in Fig 2 And this system is the first

Communication between the 2D and 3D system was also implemented en-US In the second stage, the deep collection and integration of geological information resources in the institute of Beijing Geological Data Center with good updating mechanism will get to work  An integrated analysis subsystem of groundwater environment and land subsidence will be formed based on the groundwater environment monitoring net and the land subsidence monitoring net  The multi-disciplinary crosssystem and comprehensive analysis and decision-making assistance of urban geology will also be achieved. This phase of the project is going on smoothly en-US IV  C ONCLUSIONS  en-US Along with the increasingly rapid pace of urbanization in China, there occurs some mega-city regions with the cluster of talent capital technology and information It becomes increasingly urgent for the intellectualized integrated multidimensional and quick-response mega-city geological safety supporting system in order to guarantee the geological resources and geological environment safety and sustainable development  However it  may be some difficult to develop such a system for that it involves several professional fields with complexity high technical content and a wide range of services  Based on the geological data and application characteristics this paper analyzed the requirements of geological safety supporting system for mega-city regions, then design ed  the architecture of the system and carried out the construction of Beijing geological safety supporting system This study can be helpful for other mega-city regions for different mega-cities may have many common needs for the system construction  In addition this study may also be referenced for the system construction in the other scale cities en-US REFERENCES en-US 1  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Lue Book of Cities In China Annual Report on Urban Development of China NO.2 NO.3 NO.4 NO.5, 2009 2010 2011 2012 en-US 2  Bridging the Urban Divide, UN.

In the data, we included year, MSRP, weight, resolution max FPS, and Focus Points as our main indicators. We choose output-oriented TFDEA model to calculate base on our project objective. The basic structural properties of DSLR camera are price, weight and size, which are selected as structural indicators. Resolution, max FPS, and Focus Point are selected as functional indicators Conceptually, TFDEA calls for testing each technology The technological rate of change 002 for product k at any time t, is represented by 002 013i 013r 1  B r iefly   000 013g\001á\013h represents the i th input and 000 013p\001á\013h represents the rth output of technology k. The variable 005 013i 013r 014 also serves as the objective function and represents the amount of additional output which should be achievable by technology k at time period 000 013d if k were stateof-art at that time. The variables 002I 013h\001á\013i describe how much of technology j is used in setting a target of performance for technology k. According to TFDEA method, the algorithm is shown as above in Fig. 10 To predict the characteristics of DSLR camera technology in 2012 and beyond, we need the past technical characteristics of comparable DSLR camera. Thus we examined indicators fo r the data collected from the more than 100 DSLR to obtain the ideal result by trying on different types of inputs and outputs combination  V  RESULTS  Table 2 illustrates the best-fit result of the model Dynamic frontier year is selected to use the effective date to define the second goal as maximum value. Output orientation model is used because DSLR trend tends to improve resolution and frame per second \(FPS\ore than weight and price. Therefore, finding how the output of the DSLR technology is increased at the same level of input is our goal CRS imply that outputs are increased in the same proportion inputs. The Average Rate of Change is shown at 1.244200 which means DSLR efficiency is improved around 24 percent every year. Frontier year at 2006 means the dataset is divided into before 2006, at 2006 and after 2006. MAD \(Mean Absolute Deviation\ is 1.767841, which means it could be 21 months error when this forecasting model is applied to the DSLR model. The second portion of the table illustrates that the model uses 2 inputs, MSRP and weight, and 3 outputs resolution, Max FPS and FP, for forecasting DSLR technology. There are 50 camera s of the 115 analyzed that are State of Art \(SOA\when they are released to the market and 10 cameras are still the SOA in 2006. 12 out of 50 stateof-art cameras are used to calculate the rate of change. 7 technologies are released be fore forecasted date, and 67 cameras are released after forecasted date TABLE 2 MODEL RESULT Frontier Type Orientation 2nd Goal Return to Scale Avg RoC Frontier Year MAD Dynamic OO Max CRS 1.244200 2006 1.767841 Input\(s Output\(s SOA products at Release SOA products on Frontier RoC contributors Release before forecast Release after forecast 2 3 50 10 12 7 67   Fig. 11 Forecasting result at frontier year 2006 2122 2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies 


The Fig. 11 shows the result ch art of DSLR technology at frontier year 2006 with 2 inputs and 3 outputs. From the chart, there are some technologies that are located on the diagonal line, which means it is perfect forecasting. However most of the forecasted camera t echnologies are not located on the SOA line, which can be the mean absolute deviation error of 21 months  VI  DISCUSSION  A. Effect of Market Segmentation In the model and data section, the DSLR market can be divided into several market segmentations; professional semi-professional, mid-range and entry market. And, in general, each market requires different characteristics. For example, in the professional DSLR market, photographers prefer higher performance and ruggedness, while entry level photographers want affordable price of cameras. Therefore when a particular segment of data set used in this research is analyzed with TFDEA, the resu lt might show distinguishable characteristics of the market segments. The Fig. 12 and 13 show forecasting results of two ranges of datasets professional and semi-professional markets. In here, in case of semi-professional cameras, the learning period is relatively shorter than the professional market. Therefore, considering enough the learning period, the frontier year is set to 2008 because the first camera in semi-professional market was released in 2002 while the first professional camera was released in 1999    Fig. 12 Forecasting results of the professional market   Fig. 13 Forecasting results of the semi-professional market  In these two results, MAD is lower than the forecasting results of all dataset without considering segmentation. This means smaller forecasting error and more accurate forecasting results. In addition compared w ith all range market, the results in which market range is reflected have smaller differences between released date and forecasted date like the table 3 As a result, considering market segmentation in TFDEA is reasonable to get more credible forecasting results. In other words, if distinct market segmentation exists such as this research, we need to use different inputs and outputs according to the circumstances  VII  CONCLUSION  A. Limitation An analysis of validation of previous camera data to forecast the camera technology in the future by including all the cameras in the market from professional to low-end cameras to the model seemed to be inapplicable with the result of high in standard deviation \(MAD\ since different camera market ranges result in different levels of camera technology. In case of the pr ofessional cameras which are considered to be the most versatile cameras to capture image in any light conditions, the lack of the usable ISO data as a functional characteristic to some of cameras is the missing measurement of camera efficiency and the result could be biased. The maximum ISO could be considered as an alternative output but it is left unused since it is not an accurate indicator of cameras to be considered high-ISO performers  TABLE 3 COMPARISON OF MARKET SEGMENTATION Model Market segment Released date Without segmentation With segmentation Forecasted Date Difference Forecasted Date Difference Canon Eos 1D X Professional 2012 2004.83 7.17 2011.76 0.24 Nikon D800 Semi-professional 2012 2009.68 2.32 2012.45 0.45  2123 2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies 


There are other several outputs that are interesting and should be included in the model since DSLR cameras are compelling than other types of camera but with the limitation of the model, only a maximum of 3 outputs can be applied With the time constraint, the DLSR cameras in mid-range and entry markets were left to be forecasted in this report Additionally, some MSRP in entry DSLR camera market can be considered invalid since they are sold with lens kit and there is no accurate MSRP of entry DSLR camera bodies only available which the result could be potentially inaccurate  B. Future Work Since DSLR cameras in mid-range and low-end markets were left and these two markets are considerably larger than semi-profession and professiona l camera markets, forecasting technology changes in these markets is interesting and should be considered to be a future work Different DSLR cameras markets have different technology priorities. For exam ple, professional cameras are designed for those professional photographers who demand speed and versatility to capture images in any light conditions rather than resolution. Therefor e, considering prioritizing the outputs with weights for each camera market can be a future work to improve the result  REFERENCES    B Chavanu T he E ssential Guide To Digital Photography makeuseof.com 2010  Availab l e http://manuals.makeuseof.com.s3.amazonaws.com/formobile/MakeUseOf_Guide_Digital_ Photography.pdf.
