227We introduce a social network analysis method as a new approach to build an Intrusion Detection System SNIDS in ad hoc networks The SN-IDS utilizes social relations as metrics-of-interest for anomaly detections which is different from most traditional IDS approaches To construct proper social networks we 036rst investigate ad hoc MAC and network layer data attributes and select relevant social feature sets then we

build up a set of socio-matrices based on these features Social analysis methods are applied to these matrices to detect suspicious behaviors of mobile nodes NS-2 simulation results show that this SN-IDS system can effectively detect common attacks with high detection rates and low false positive alarm rates Furthermore it has clear advantages over the conventional association rule based data mining IDS in terms of computation and system complexity

and Lee de v eloped a cross-feature analysis using decisiontree based classi\336cation algorithm for local anomaly detection Mell and McLarnon proposed a hierarchical IDS architecture  A cluster of neighboring MANET nodes randomly and fairly elect a monitoring node to run IDS In this work we attempt to study the capability of social network analysis as a new anomaly detection tool Our objective is to demonstrate that a set of properly constructed social networks can be as effective as some conventional data mining based IDS in capturing network attacks while with less system complexity To the best of our knowledge our work of building an intrusion detection system using the social network analysis method is the 336rst of its kind II SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS There are three formal ways to analyze the huge amount of 
A CENTRALITY 
Freeman General Centrality is a v ery important quantitative parameter representing which members of a network are important The three widely used centrality measures are 322degree\323 322betweenness\323 and 322closeness\323 322Degree\323 is de\336ned as the number of direct connections an actor has to other members of the network Actors with a high degree centrality are popular nodes with a large amount of links to other nodes in the network If we represent the whole network graph as 
social network data descriptive methods using social graphs statistical modeling and analysis methods using the adjacency matrix socio-matrix In this paper we focus on analysis methods especially the 322centrality\323 properties  and the total number of nodes as

 An actor is considered in a favored position if it frequently falls on the geodesic paths between other pairs of actors in the network 322Closeness\323 centrality means how close a node is to all the other nodes in the network by emphasizing all the distances rather than only with its immediate nodes Thus this parameter also shows the importance of the node The de\336nition of 978-1-4244-2309-5/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE 1

betweenness We set node15 as the malicious node playing the blackhole attack and study the attack impact on node15\325s immediate neighbor node27 In Figure 3 during the attack time the betweenness of the attacker node15 increases sharply with attracting many other nodes to join its ego network At the same time node27\325s betweenness decreases as many of its alter nodes stop their connections to node27 thus its ego network is degenerated to a smaller one with fewer alters

attack Furthermore the 322betweenness\323 impact is not constrained to the attacker\325s immediate neighbors Not being a neighbor to the attacker node15 node2\325s ego network also changed during the attack Figure 4 shows its ego network before and after the blackhole attack with connection numbers dropped among the ego and some alters If node2 has nodes on its neighboring list i.e node6 21 25 and 27 which are victims and immediate neighbors of node15 the connections from these victim nodes to node2 would immediately decrease to zero at the beginning of the attack period thus the betweenness of node2 would increase sharply as the denominator in Equation 2 decreases Therefore with neighboring nodes unchanged node2 which is not on the victim list within one-hop range would detect the occurrence of an attack over multi-hop range Table III shows the average ratios of nodes that successfully and falsely detect the blackhole and sleep deprivation attacks for different pause time As shown in the table with a low is its 337exibility to de\336ne what the 322actors\323 are and what the 322ties\323 are For ego networks with different types of actors and ties the same metrics analysis methods can be employed which means the system does not have to change the analysis tool but the objects for different design purposes The metrics analysis will apply the mathematical methods introduced in section II We use control and data traf\336c to construct social networks Each social network is represented by an adjacency matrix For control matrices 322degree\323 centrality is calculated since 322betweenness\323 does not mean anything for control messages For data matrices both 322betweenness\323 and 322degree\323 centrality are computed Although we do not monitor other matrices such as MAC ACK/Route Request/Route Reply/Route Error all these ego networks can be easily generated if needed The pro\336le built up process is divided into two phases During the training phase training data is collected over a long period of time relative to testing data By repeating the simulation multiple times a normal pro\336le is constructed by averaging the outputs from the metrics analysis component During the testing phase the calculated social metrics of the testing data will be compared to the normal pro\336le if testing data statistics violate the ones from the normal pro\336le an anomaly will be reported details in IV C IV PERFORMANCE EVALUATION The simulation platform we use is Network Simulator NS2 Table II lists our simulation environment TABLE II NS-2 SIMULATION SCENARIOS AND PARAMETERS   Parameter  Link capacity  Average transmission rate per 337ow  Pause time  Max Moving Speed  We use the following three metrics to evaluate the performance of our proposed detection system 1 Single-node successful detection rate the probability of at least one node in the network that detects the attacks correctly during a particular time frame 2 Multi-node successful detection ratio the ratio of the number of nodes that detect the attacks correctly during a particular time frame to the total number of nodes in the network 3 Multi-node false positive ratio the ratio of the number of nodes falsely identifying attack-free events as anomalies during a particular time frame to the total number of nodes in the network From a normal 322betweenness\323 pro\336le in Figure 2 we can see that the 322local betweenness\323 will 337uctuate around a local mean indicating changes of routing information due to node movements or link failures Thus in our work during both training and testing phases a sliding window is applied for alleviating the 322betweenness\323 337uctuation

930,000 data transactions for total 30 minutes at each node with 7 features for each transaction Before aggregation 246 rules are generated 21 rules are left after 11 rules are contributable for the 336nal detection The average detection delay for Apriori based IDS is  excluded the time spent on picking valuable rules Therefore our SN-IDS system is comparably simpler in implementation and computation while socio-metrics are comparable to the Apriori based anomaly rules VII CONCLUSIONS In this work we introduced the social network analysis method to build an intrusion detection system SN-IDS for ad hoc networks This SN-IDS is intended to monitor different relations among the ad hoc nodes and generate alarms when one or more relation rules are violated We also showed that the capability of the proposed SN-IDS can be further extended with the help of combining different matrices to study multirelations simultaneously Furthermore the proposed system has a clear advantage over popular association rule based IDS in terms of computation and system complexity R EFERENCES  S Marti P  Ganesan and H Garcia-Molina 322Dht routing using social links,\323 in Proceedings of the

   Figure. 2. The complete concept map 4  Conclusions In this paper, we have pres ented a new method to automatically construct concepts maps for adaptive learning systems. First, we calculate the counter values, where the counter values indicate the answer-consistence between any two questions. Then, base on fo ur kinds of association rules we apply the Apriori Algorithm to mine some information Finally, we calculate the relevan ce degree between any two concepts to construct concepts maps for adaptive learning systems. The proposed method provides us with a useful way to construct concepts map in adaptive learning systems  Acknowledgements This work was supported in party by the National Science Council, Republic of China, under Grant NSC 97-2221-E-011-107-MY3   References 1  R.
