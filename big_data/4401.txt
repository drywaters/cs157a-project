 7 BIOGRAPHY  7 1 INTRODUCTION Accurate global measurements of CO2 mixing ratios is of great scientific and popular interest and yet there is substantial uncertainty in the current atmospheric C02 budget The techniques for measuring C02 are spatially localized and quite antiquated Currently the most comprehensive set of atmospheric C02 data is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory 
CMDL cooperative air-sampling network consisting of more than 40 sites where flasks of air are collected approximately weekly and analyzed CMDL reports that the average annual increase in C02 mixing ratio since 1980 has been on the order of 1 ppm/year and the average C02 mixing ratio currently stands at approximately 382 ppm The continued addition of anthropogenic C02 to the naturally occurring C02 background strongly suggests that present levels 
of C02 should be much higher and that an unknown sink is responsible for the present levels Thus any instrument attempting to measure C02 mixing ratios 1 U.S Government work not protected by U.S copyright 2 IEEEAC paper 1257 Version 4 Updated 2007:10:25 from space and identify the missing sink must be able to measure the absolute mixing ratio with a long-term precision of 1 ppm and be able to measure globally to all latitudes in all 
seasons measuring over both day and night The current state of the art for passive space-based remote sensing of atmospheric C02 is the Orbiting Carbon Observatory OCO scheduled for launch in 2008 OCO is a NASA mission for measuring total column C02 and 02 by detecting absorption in reflected sunlight 1 Although Figure 1 A near-polar orbiting active laser sounder instrument can unambiguously globally map the C02 mixing ratios at high and low latitudes in all seasons 
and in day or night conditions _ ___  l  RrEfLEF 24#g2M Figure 2 The Orbiting Carbon Observatory has unavoidable physical limitations imposed by the passive measurement approach that include daytime/high sun only sampling interference by cloud and aerosol scattering non-uniform C02 profile and limited signal variability in the C02 column OCO will yield important new information about the distribution of atmospheric C02  there are unavoidable 1 


physical limitations imposed by the passive measurement approach that include daytime/high sun only sampling interference by cloud and aerosol scattering and limited signal variability in the CO2 column See figures 1  2 There is a critical need for an active laser remote sensing instrument that can measure with 1 ppm accuracy from space which will be able to answer the question where is all the CO2 going In this paper we report on progress and results from our breadboard active optical-sensing system in measuring open-path integrated-column abundance of C02 in real time We have made simple yet significant improvements to our bread-board laser-sounder instrument and real-time data processing that now enables absolute absorption measurements to better than 261 0.0500 The transmitter is a tunable narrow-linewidth MHz diodelaser seeded 0.5W Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier in the Master Oscillator Power Amplifier configuration operating in the 1572 nm C02 absorption band in pulsed or chopped cw-mode The receiver consists of a modified 8 SchmidtCassegrain telescope fiber coupled multi-mode to either a InGaAs pin diode or photomultiplier tube The system is light weight efficient and easily scalable to higher optical powers The frequency scanning system measures the line shape removes background structure and instrument effects and determines the integrated column abundance of C02 All optical systems that measure absolute absorption are subject to systematic errors that arise from interference effects dispersion frequency dependent gain and reflection losses all of which introduce structure easily mistaken for the desired signal These frequency dependent noise sources are time varying and difficult to eliminate Our system like most is designed to minimize these effects however any error in determining the background greatly affects the absorption accuracy We have modified both our hardware and software that in real-time tracts the noise and background structure and minimizes these effect on the data The addition of a wedged beam splitter and integrating sphere to the transmitter power monitor minimizes the introduction of any interference effects and enables reliable ratio-ing of the signal and monitor and better determination of the background structure We improve on the standard on-line off-line determination of absorption since we directly measure the absorption line shape In this paper we present data on stability and open path measurements of C02 The zeropath measurements show an accuracy of better than 261 0.05 over 10 hours without re-calibration Data comparisons with a spot measurements instrument LICOR shows correlation with the diurnal cycle and rush-hour variations in C02 We will show data from 0.4 km one way open path to a cooperative target using an InGaAs pin diode and from uncooperative target using photon-counting PMT In addition we will present data from our upcoming Fall-2007 field test comparison with calibrated instruments on the NOAABAO tower in Erie Colorado 2 INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION The laser sounding technique measures the total column average absorption by C02 from space A co-located measurements of the 02 column absorption will allow us to account for variations in the C02 absorption path caused by topography surface pressure changes and variable humidity as well as having major independent benefit to weather analysis and forecasting Our method can measure at all latitudes at any sun angle e.g dawn and dusk and is more robust against bias caused by diurnal variations in surface C02 mixing ratios 0.6 8 2-V 1 I5 50 t55 U 115 tsI Figure 3 Near IR C02 and background spectra from space We have selected the spectral region near 1.57 tm based on several criteria The spectral band consists of discrete lines that are free from interference from water vapor and other trace atmospheric gases The optical depths are strong enough to provide high sensitivity to changes in the C02 column In addition this wavelength falls within the telecommunications L-Band and it is also a wavelength region where the defense and security industry is also interested for various applications Our design is synergistic with the technology advancements in this area and we can leverage the substantial commercial and government research and development effort focused on improving components in this wavelength region High power erbium doped fiber amplifiers EDFA used in long haul telecommunication networks are rugged fairly compact and extremely reliable They have achieved powers of several hundreds of Watts Their spectroscopic properties narrow linewidth and high spectral purity make them suitable for this application They can also be space qualified as more defense and security applications are implemented In addition single-frequency narrow linewidth distributed feedback DFB semiconductor lasers are available for the 1.57tam transmitter These low power lasers will seed the EDFAs to generate the high powers needed for operation from orbit Receiver components 2 


detectors are also commercially available at this wavelength Although the CO2 absorption band near 1570 nm is relatively free from interferences by other species Figure 3 it is crucial that the most suitable line is selected for the sounder approach The spectroscopic conditions that must be met low temperature sensitivity negligible interferences from other species etc are analyzed in detail by Mao et.al 2 Traditional DIAL uses only two lines on and off to measure the absorption Our technique will use six or more lasers to sample the CO2 absorption line By judiciously choosing the wavelength of each laser line we can weigh the measurements to the lowest part of the troposphere where most of the CO2 signal variability occurs The wavelength of each laser must be precisely controlled to a high degree of accuracy and must be actively locked to the wavelength of interest The most stringent requirement applies to the lasers locked to the side of the absorption where the slope is the highest and the least stringent to the peak and wings of the absorption where the slope is the lowest For a pressure broadened absorption the locking requirement is 2 MHz for the lasers locked on the side of the absorption and roughly 30 MHz for the peak For the initial breadboard work we use a frequency tunable diode laser that substitutes for multiple lasers Precise absolute spectroscopic measurements of trace gases present enormous challenges to any instrument ground or space-borne Typically a laser absorption spectrometer based on a direct absorption technique is capable of measuring absorptions in the 10-2 to 10-3 range with a 1 sec averaging time High frequency modulation techniques such as frequency and wavelength modulation have increased the sensitivity limit to 10-7 to 10-8 the quantum or shot noise limit using phase sensitive detection and various modulation schemes Phase sensitive detection techniques achieve their high sensitivity by detecting in a region of the frequency spectrum where there is little 1/f noise most lasers and detectors exhibit 1/f or flicker noise However the challenge for a C02 instrument is to achieve high precision or stability not high sensitivity The absorption from space is roughly 9000 so there is no need for high sensitivity The challenge of obtaining 1-ppm long-term precision or stability is very different from obtaining high sensitivity The metrics used for long-term precision stability and sensitivity are also different High signal to noise SNR traditionally used to denote the sensitivity of a spectrometer in a 1-Hz bandwidth is not a good metric in describing the long-term precision Achieving a high SNR with a 1 sec averaging time does not imply a long-term precision capability for arbitrarily long times In fact it has been shown that longer averaging times can actually degrade the SNR Increasing the averaging time will reduce random noise but non-random noise sources typically described as drifts in the system will actually degrade the ability of the system to discern small changes in absorption These issues were recognized and addressed in frequency modulation spectrometers see for example Werle et.al 3 but they are applicable to any laser spectrometer independent of detection method In order to address them in a more quantitative fashion and determine the maximum averaging time for a spectrometer Werle et.al used the Allan variance as a metric of the system's stability as opposed to the SNR There are many sources of noise and drifts in a laser spectrometer Examples of random noise include thermal or Johnson noise shot quantum noise and detector noise Examples of drifts or non-random noise include opto-mechanical drifts due to temperature changes etalon fringes laser wavelength drift etc All of these noise sources and drifts contribute to the total error budget of the instrument One of the most difficult error sources to address is etalon fringes Etalon fringes are interference patterns generated by multiple reflections in the optical path and small transmission variations in optical elements which result in a background structure that is time dependent and changes as a function of temperature pressure vibration or mechanical stress More often than not this time-varying background has a similar signature as the absorption feature of interest making it exceedingly difficult to suppress This background structure is present in all absorption spectrometers independent of detection method direct detection phase sensitive detection DIAL etc or type of detector used and cannot be eliminated by simple filtering If etalons were stationary in time they could be subtracted and would simply represent an offset in the total absorption measurement However since they vary on time scales comparable to the signal of interest i.e C02 absorption they will be interpreted as signal as their amplitude and/or phase changes The challenge of suppressing etalon fringes was recognized decades ago and many hardware and software methods have been successful in reducing but not totally eliminating their impact 4-7 Careful optical design is of paramount importance Anti-reflection coatings the use of reflective as opposed to transmissive optics angled or wedged optics can keep etalon fringes to a minimum Frequent calibrations for in-situ measurements in cells are also used to minimize the effect of drifts Unfortunately this is not practical in a space mission Most hardware techniques try to wash out the fringes i.e reduce their coherence by vibrating an optical element a mirror or Brewster plate This can be effective if there is only one dominant etalon fringe whose structure does not change significantly over time This approach would not be practical in a space instrument since we cannot fully characterize or have prior knowledge of the instrument 3 


drifts in space In addition it would add cost and complexity to the instrument Most software methods use digital signal processing to filter out the fringes Digital filters 8,9 can be effective in reducing the effect of fringes however they do have their limitations The unwanted background structure usually includes several fringes with different dependence on temperature pressure and other factors The fringe free spectral range or period may be large making it difficult to determine its frequency and phase and devise an effective filter Finally some fringes will have the same or comparable free spectral range as the width of the absorption making them virtually impossible to filter without filtering out the absorption signal Despite these limitations signal processing because of its flexibility low cost and zero mass remains the preferred solution for a space mission We have used a combination of hardware and software techniques to reduce the effect of fringes and other drifts in our C02 sensor The present breadboard configuration consists of a distributed-feedback diode laser operating at 1572.33 nm which acts as a seed for a polarization maintaining 500 mW EDFA A single laser was used in the long-term precision stability experiments We have successfully used a two-laser approach and have been successful in locking the laser wavelength within 12 MHz using a commercial wavemeter However in order to demonstrate the required stability a single laser was used A small percentage of the seed laser is directed into a fiber cell containing C02 for wavelength calibration purposes figure 4 The laser wavelength is scanned over the absorption using a small ramp from a waveform generator The amplified seed from the EDFA is collimated in free space and about 10 is directed into an integrating-sphere power-monitor assembly to normalize output power fluctuations of the transmitter and any common mode noise and fringes The rest of the beam is directed outside our laboratory onto a hard or soft target trees depending on the type of detector we are using a photodiode or a PMT can be used with the system The return is collected by an all-reflective 8 diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and coupled into a large core high NA fiber The fiber is then connected to either a photomultiplier tube or a photodiode depending on the experiment The path length to the hard target is approximately 400 m A mechanical chopper modulates the beam to establish a zero-baseline offset and subtract any variations in the baseline due to the solar background or other offsets A computer digitizes the signals divides the signal by the reference and applies a real-time signal-processing algorithm similar to a matched filter to estimate the size of absorption The transmitter and telescope can be turned 180 degrees and the beam directed through an absorption cell and onto a diffuse target The receiver telescope then collects the light scattered by the diffuse target Figure 4 Plot of laser power as a function of drive current recorded after an absorption cell As the laser is current-tuned the output power increases and sweeps through three absorptions The center absorption is the 1572.33 nm C02 line Figure 5 Breadboard functional block diagram showing the transmitter upper and receiver lower 3 MEASUREMENTS Zero-path measurement stability measurements To evaluate the long-term precision of our transmitter we measure the absorption through our zero-path setup This consists of an absorption cell containing a known concentration of C02  several folding optics and a scattering surface The co-aligned transmitter/receiver scope is rotated from the open path test range to point at the absorption cell 4 


Figure 6 Photograph of the zero-path setup The coaligned transmitter/receiver scope is rotated from the open path test range to point at the absorption cell The transmitted light is directed to a scattering screen viewed by the receiver scope without need to refocus or adjust boresight The unabsorbed light is directed to a scattering screen which is viewed by the receiver scope without need of refocusing or re-alignment The cell is setup so that during our open path measurements the transmitter/receiver can be turned around and checked against our zero-path reference To distinguish the in-cell measurements from the open-path range we refer to the in-cell measurements as zero-path the actual optical path through the cell is 0.33 m The cell is filled with approximately 10 mbar of pure 99.990/O CO2 and the peak absorption measured as a function of time Figure 7 is a time series of data over approximately 60 hours Over this period the cell pressure slowly increases due to a slow-leak to air The line is thus buffered by increasing air pressure The natural abundance of CO2 in atmospheric air entering the cell is too low to affect the measurement or in the minimal open-air optical path in the zero-path setup The decrease in absorption with time is due to pressure broadening and is compensated by an increasing linewidth not shown The solid red line is a the linear fit through the data The long-term precision as determined by the min-max not the standard deviation or the Allan variance of the entire time series data is an absorption of 0.1 although there are periods where the system is much more stable Figure 8 plots the difference between the measured peak absorption and the linear fit shown in figure 7 For over 12 hours the measured reading is within 2610.050o of the peak absorption as determined from the linear fit Depending on the selection of the C02 line we can expect a 50-90 00 absorption assuming a mixing ratio of 370-380 ppm Using the 500 absorption from space our long term precision translates to 0.13 In order to meet the 1-ppm requirement a 1/370 or 0.27 precision would be needed One cannot expect any system to remain stable indefinitely especially without any cross checks or calibration This system exceeds the necessary long-term precision required for a space based instrument 26 34 42 50 I 66 74 2 92 Time\(Hours Figure 7 Measured absorption in the Zero-path setup as a function of time The slow decrease in absorption is due to pressure-broadening The cell initially contained 10 mbar of pure C02 Atmospheric air slow leak increased the pressure broadening the line and decreasing the peak absorption r I f e11 015_ 9:6 71 72 74 75 77 78 g ITime\(Hours Figure 8 Difference between measured reading and fit over a 12 hour period shown in figure 7 Data shows a region where we meet the 0.05 spec for 12 hours From space we have an opportunity to use measurements of C02 over the Antarctic continent as a cross check The C02 over Antarctica is essentially constant through out the year Assuming an orbital period of approximately 90 minutes the system will have several passes to perform a necessary calibration cross check Our breadboard sensor meets the long-term precision for well over 90 minutes A C02 sensor not only needs long-term precision but it needs to measure the absolute C02 mixing ratio We compared our breadboard system with a C02 measurement standard LICOR C02 H20 gas analyzer The LICOR gas analyzer draws air from the top of the building above where our breadboard system is located so it is a localized sample whereas our sensor measures the integrated column C02 absorption over a parking lot and woods Thus depending on the current wind we do not 5 4  1 9 1111 CD 7

key parameters for root cause analysis of anomalies This study emphasizes that the defined baseline can be used to characterize a new computer model This will allow us to characterize a new notebook computer regardless of the model and reduce the time for analysis In this study PPA and MD were independently used to identify the similarity of new observations to healthy data PPA performed this analysis in a reduced dimension based on an optimization criterion maximum variance It was also found that PPA can identify the faulty parameters based on the data whereas MD requires an understanding of the system The strength of PPA lies in the ability to decompose the signal and extract additional information not originally available used to identify faults in the system PPA overcomes masking effects when working with highly correlated data The strength of the MD method is that it preserves all the information available because it does not reduce the original dimensionality of the data The drawbacks of using just the MD method are that it cannot be used directly for fault identification and it is susceptible to masking effects With the MD results and our understanding of the system functionality four critical parameters were empirically identified the fan speed and the three temperature components CPU temperature motherboard temperature and videocard temperature In parallel in the PPA approach the principal component space also identified the fan speed as the most dominant and from the residual principal component space three temperature parameters were identified to be dominant mathematically confirming the earlier empirical conclusion The cross-validated result shows that these two algorithms can be used for fault detection and isolation The MD method can be used for quick fault detection at a system level and fault isolation can be made if related fault to MD signatures are available PPA can also be used when system faults are not known and where critical parameters need to be identified ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is sponsored by the members of the CALCE Prognostics and Health Management Consortium at the University of Maryland College Park REFERENCES 1 N Vichare P Rodgers V Eveloy and M Pecht Environment and Usage Monitoring of Electronic Products for Health Assessment and Product Design International Journal of Quality Technology and Quantitative Management 2\(4 235-250 2007 2 J Gu N Vichare T Tracy and M Pecht Prognostics Implementation Methods for Electronics 53rd Annual Reliability  Maintainability Symposium RAMS Florida 2007 3 G Zhang C Kwan R Xu N Vichare and M Pecht An Enhanced Prognostic Model for Intermittent Failures in Digital Electronics IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky MT March 2007 4 N Vichare and M Pecht Enabling Electronic Prognostics Using Thermal Data Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Thermal Investigation of ICs and Systems Nice Cote d'Azur France 27-29 September 2006 5 N Vichare P Rodgers and M Pecht Methods for Binning and Density Estimation of Load Parameters for Prognostics and Health Management International Journal of Performability Engineering Vol 2 No 2 April 2006 6 A Fraser N Hengartner K Vixie and B Wohlberg Incorporating Invariants in Mahalanobis Distance based Classifiers Application to Face Recognition in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN Portland OR USA Jul 2003 7 J Edward Jackson Govind S Mudholkar Control Procedures for Residuals Associated With Principal Component Analysis Technometrics Vol.21 No.3 1979 8 J Liu Khiang-Wee Lim R Srinivasan and X Doan On-Line Process Monitoring and Fault Isolation Using PCA Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Symposium on Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation pp 658 661 2005 9 G Taguchi S Chowdhury and Y Wu The Mahalanobis-Taguchi System New York McGrawHill 2001 10 E B Martin A J Morris and J Zhang Process Performance Monitoring Using Multivariate Statistical Process CSontrol IEE Proc Control Theory Application Vol 143 No.2 March 1996 11 H Chen G Jiang C Ungureanu and K Yoshihira Failure Detection and Localization in Component Based Systems by Online Tracking KDD 2005 12 H Wang Z Song and P Li Fault Detection Behavior and Performance Analysis of Principal Component Analysis Based Process Monitoring Methods American Chemical Society Vol 41 pp 2455 2464 2002 13 H H Yue S.J Qin Reconstruction-Based Fault Identification Using a Combined Index American Chemical Society Vol 40 pp 4403-4414 2001 8

I r Z  Figure 9 A Military Modeling and Simulation Configuration of the Ilium Framework To do that we have assembled a collection of trusted military simulations that span the range of such applications from fine-grained simulations that focus on detailed interactions between two entities to coarse-grained simulations of military campaigns Figure 9 illustrates the Ilium Framework configured to accommodate those simulations as well as representative prototype systems In this case the legacy applications are simulations analysis systems and design tools Prototypes are notional UAV autopilots route planners decision support systems and similar applications The Framework augments these applications with control objects and agents that coordinate computations in the composed system and specialize agents that typically represent the characteristics of a new system or technology that cannot be easily or adequately simulated in any of the component legacy systems In our current study the following systems have Ilium Framework plugins and are used as components in the study environment 12 Al f<cOmmi.ain FIa 1A  


THUNDER is a campaign simulation that models national military forces and military operations that extend over months 30  Characteristics of individual systems are evaluated statistically and their effects on the overall campaign are not explicitly known Political social and cultural objects and concepts are not included in the model In this configuration THUNDER is used to generate force level tasking mission orders and to evaluate and adjust for the results of missions with respect to campaign plans SEAS is a force level simulation that simulates battles between major forces in combat operations that typically last for hours and as much as a day SEAS features a flexible rules based decision logic that can influence behavior at both the commander and individual combatant level SEAS executes the missions requested by THUNDER and provides a manageable dynamic context for examining the behavior of prototypes in a range of typical operational situations  31 A dynamic plug-in supports interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components EADSIM is a trusted model of air defense systems that is in particular sensitive to many important design attributes of individual systems In certain modified forms it can reference advanced sensor and engagement decision models In our study configuration EADSIM simulates enemy air defenses in selected e.g significant to our investigation portions of the virtual battle A dynamic plug-in supports system control as well as interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components A prototype aircraft mission planning system plug-in supports virtual real time mission plan creation and updates In particular the system provides automatic route planning for selected platforms that have been assigned missions by THUNDER and that are subsequently executed in simulation in SEAS and EADSIM The Ilium Framework itself provides software agents that are used to model notional or experimental UAV characteristics and behaviors Depending on the objectives of a particular study the Framework may also provide agents that address advanced Command and Control concepts to coordinate the interaction of the various component systems We maintain a semantic consistency among the plugged-in component applications by developing a single operational scenario as initial input for a study and deriving the necessary application configuration data from that source We create an RDF model of the scenario based on the Ilium suite of ontologies that includes political context issues objectives sensitivities etc military context centers of gravity campaign objectives etc geophysical environment military units order of battle unit equipment lists etc command and control assets platforms weapons ISR systems etc Figure 11 below is an excerpt from an operational scenario set in the Southwest U.S depicting a description of an Air Force Wing assigned to a notional Joint Task Force The Wing is based at Bishop Air Base and has six Fighter Squadrons assigned to it Additional detail about each of those squadrons as well as the base is found in the model in this case an rdf:resource  associated with it morg:AirForceWing rdf:ID="USAF_366 Air_Exp Wg dc:creator>Doug Holmes</dc:creator mgeo:basedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB geo:positionedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB_pos morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 390_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_494_Ftr_Sq dc date I 0/20/07</dc date morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_496 Ftr_Sq rdfs:comment>366 AEW F-22 F-15 KC-135 130]</rdfs:comment morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 389_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 391 Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 495_Ftr_Sq rdfs:label>366 Air Expeditionary Wing</rdfs:label morg:AirForceWing ab9 7P.b ii uI1 L L CFigure 11 An RDF model of a notional USAF Wing Figure 12 is another excerpt from the same scenario illustrating a model of a particular Fighter Squadron and one of the F-15E aircraft it operates Figure 10 Legacy Components in the Ilium Framework 13 suka

aircraft Note that these models also have associated SEAS models that contain information peculiar to the SEAS simulation about these entities This information is used to configure SEAS to properly represent these particular entities We are also able to insert objects and information that may be of interest in our study that is not represented in any of the component simulations or other applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to extract data from the scenario to create the input files needed to configure the various applications.[36 SELECT name pos long lat alt vis W1HLERE name rdf:type mast SeasLocation name geo:positionedAt pos pos pos:long long pos pos:lat lat pos pos:alt alt name msim:Visible vis  Figure 13 A typical SPARQL query In a similar fashion SPARQL is used to extract data from the scenario to create the necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
