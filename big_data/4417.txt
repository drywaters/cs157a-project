System Design and Resource Allocation in 802.16j Multi-hop Relay Systems under the User Rate Fairness Constraint Hui Zeng, Chenxi Zhu Fujitsu Labs of America, 8400 Baltimore Ave, #302 College Park, MD 20740, US hui.zeng, chenxi.zhu}@us.fujitsu.com   Abstract 227IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay task standard includes two mutually exclusive options: transparent relay stations \(T-RS and non-transparent relay stations \(NT-RS\n this work, a system design approach is proposed to compare different relay systems in term of their capacity with rate fairness constraint among the Mobile Stations \(MS\. Single-Input Single-Output SISO\ and Multi-Input Multi-Output \(MIMO\ antenna systems 
are considered in the links between the Base Station \(BS\ and Relay Stations \(RS\. 1 and 3 RSs per sector are considered. Our simulation results show that for any case, the highest capacity is achieved by NT-RS with 3 RSs per sector in distributed scheduling mode. In addition, the effect of the MS association rule, which determines the access station \(BS or RS\for each MS is also investigated. Two rules Highest MCS  scheme with the highest Modulation and Coding Rate, and Highest  Mod  ESE  scheme with the highest \(modified\ctive Spectrum Efficiency are studied along with the optimal rule that maximizes system 
capacity with rate fairness constraint. It is demonstrated that Highest  Mod  ESE scheme performs closely to the optimal rule in term of capacity KeywordsMultihop relay networks, IEEE 802.16j, WiMAX resource allocation, network capacity, rate fairness  I   I NTRODUCTION  Systems based on IEEE 802.16 OFDMA standard \(mobile WiMAX, or 802.16e\1 i s one  o f  t h e l ead i ng ca nd i d a t e s  f o r 4G wireless networks. Mobile WiMAX is designed to provide high data rate to mobile users with Quality-of-Service however, initial field trial of mobile WiMAX system has 
limited coverage and poor service for indoor users as well as users at cell boundaries. Using relay station \(RS\ is a well known method to extend the coverage of the base stations in cellular systems. IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay standard [2 h a s  been developed as an extension to the 802.16e OFDMA system for coverage extension and capacity enhancement with full backward compatibility to the 802.16e mobile stations \(MS\. In 802.16j relay system, relay station serves as a relay node between the multihop-relay BS and the MSs. The radio link originates from or terminates at an MS is called access link while the BS-RS link is called relay link Two modes of PHY layer operations are defined in 802.16j 
transparent relay mode and non-transparent relay mode. In transparent relay mode, a transparent RS \(T-RS\ does not transmit control signals including frame-start preamble, FCH UL/DL-MAP and DCD/UCD. Instead, a MS that access the network through a T-RS depends on the BS for these control signals. In non-transparent mode using a time-division transmit and receive relay \(TTR\echanism, a non-transparent RS NT-RS, or TTR RS\ transmits all the control signals as well as data packets like a regular BS to the MS. T-RS and NT-RS have different and incompatible frame structures and hence present mutually exclusive options: transparent relay system and non-transparent relay system \(denoted as T-RS and NT-RS 
as well\. In addition, a NT-RS can operate in either centralized or distributed scheduling mode if the transmission schedule of the RS is generated by the BS \(centralized\or the RS itself distributed\; clearly, a T-RS can only operate in centralized scheduling mode. For NT-RS, in this paper we only consider distributed scheduling mode It is important to understand the benefit and limit of each option.

and user \(MS\balancing under the user rate fairness requirement. Special attention is paid to the MS association rule in determining the access station between the BS and the RSs. We carry the study in the downlink \(DL\ direction of twohop systems where a MS connects to the BS through at most one RS; the same schemes apply to the UL direction as well We first propose a system design approach to evaluate the peruser throughput and total system capacity. Then the maximum capacity among different frame partition is obtained for each type of 802.16j system, and compared with the BS-only system 802.16e\ used as a baseline. The effect of increasing the number of deployed RSs per sector, and the usage of SISO or MIMO in the relay links are also investigated. Furthermore, for each 802.16j relay system with rate fairness constraint, two MS association rules are compared with the formulated optimal rule that achieves the maximum capacity among all the association rules and frame partitions. The effective spectrum efficiency ESE\ is used in T-RS networks, and is further modified to account for the aggressive frequency reuse in NT-RS networks The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the 802.16j relay system models. Section III first gives our proposed system design approach for capacity analysis of each relay system with certain MS association rules under the user rate fairness constraint, and then evaluates and compares their resulted capacity with respect to different relay systems and/or MS association rules.

Four cases are considered: 1 or 3 RSs per sector SISO or MIMO in relay links. In Fig. 5\(a\, the per-user data rate increases in 2-hop links while decreases in 1-hop links MIMO case has slower decreasing speed due to better relay links than SISO case. Compared with 1 RSs case, 3 RS case has worse relay links, better RS-MS links and more MSs under RSs; and their composite effect leads to its lower per-user rate in 2-hop links. Under the user rate fairness constraint, the optimal RSMS zone is determined by the intersection of the user data rate served by 1-hop \(BSMS\ and 2-hop \(BS-RS-MS links, marked as \223o\224 in Fig. 5 Figure 5  Capacity Analysis \(Per-User Rate\ T-RS with Rate Fairness Constraint Fig. 5\(b\ is very similar to Fig. 5\(a\ except the different MS associations in SISO and MIMO cases in Highest ESE scheme  Compared with Highest MCS  scheme its resulted per-user rate and system capacity is slightly better, because the MS favors the BS more in Highest ESE scheme however, with a very high SE on the relay links, this only affects fairly small number of MSs for which both the BS and RSs can support MCS levels higher than QPSK-3/4. From our simulation results of SISO1RS case, e.g., only 1.4% of MSs falls into this category B  Capacity in 2-Hop Non-Transparent Relay Systems In the case of NT-RS, the size of the access zone is almost the same for the BS and the RSs except a 2-symbol difference  DS For those MSs served by RSs, their data rate is the minimal of the rate it gets on the BS-RS link and on the RS-MS link. In order to achieve the maximal system throughput, it is not feasible for the RS-MS zone size to be the bottleneck for these MSs. This is because the system capacity can be improved by simply increasing the size of the access zone in this case. For this reason, the optimal access-zone/relay-zone partition is always achieved when the MSs served by the RSs are limited by relay-zone size and the MSs served by the BSs are limited by the access-zone size. For MS i served by RS j  j  1, \205 M let L i,j be the resource it actually consumed in RSMS zone, and z i,j be its assigned resource in BSRS zone by RS j  regardless its usage.

the resulted optimal rule locates in the critical situation in the between. Note that Highest Modified ESE scheme has significantly better capacity than Highest MCS  scheme  C  Capacity Comparison of Diffe rent 2-Hop Relay Systems Fig. 9 shows the system capacity comparison with different association rules under rate fairness constraint. The system capacity with Highest  Modified  ESE  scheme in NT-RS is based on the different per-user rate in 1-hop and 2-hop links due to the fact that no common per-user rate exists in Fig. 8\(b In Fig. 9, the capacity improvement brought by the RS especially with MIMO in the relay link, is clearly visible. With any MS association rule, the highest capacity gain is achieved in NT-RS with 3 RSs per sector in distributed mode and MIMO used in the relay link. This is because the radio resources in the access link in this configuration has the highest reuse factor therefore the resources saved by MIMO in the relay link and then assigned to the access link can be used more fully. For example, with Highest MCS scheme system capacity is improved by 133% and 155% over the 1-hop baseline system in SISO and MIMO case, respectively Figure 9  System Capacity Comparison with Rate Fairness Constraint In T-RS Highest ESE scheme is optimal with slightly better system capacity than Highest MCS scheme While in NT-RS Highest Modified ESE scheme is suboptimal but has the system capacity close to the optimal rule; it is also always significantly better than Highest MCS scheme And Highest  Modified  ESE scheme requires only information relevant to MS itself and no iterations necessary in the computation. Hence it takes much less computation time compared with the optimal rule Highest  Modified  ESE scheme can be realized as follows for T-RS, the BS performs the scheduling function with the known access and relay links\222 qualities; while for NT-RS in distributed scheduling mode, to calculate the modified ESE, the BS and RSs need to exchange the information: access and relay links\222 qualities, access station type \(BS/RS\d the number of RSs per sector IV  S UMMARY  IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay task standard draft 16jD7 includes two mutually exclusive options: transparent relay systems \(T-RS\ and non-transparent time-division transmit and receive \(TTR\relay systems \(NT-RS\ A system design approach is proposed to compare these different options in term of capacity with rate fairness constraint.

Furthermore, two heuristic MS association rules Highest MCS  scheme and Highest  Modified  ESE  scheme are presented and compared with the formulated optimal rule that maximizes system capacity under user rate fairness constraint It is shown that Highest  Modified  ESE scheme is optimal in T-RS; and that as a suboptimal rule in NT-RS, it has the system capacity close to the optimal rule with much less information exchange and computation time R EFERENCES  1  IEEE Std 802.16e: \223Air Interface for Fixed and Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems\224 with Amendment 2: \223Physical and Medium Access Control Layers for Combined Fixed and Mobile Operation in Licensed Bands\224 and Corrigendum 1 2  IEEE Std 802.16j/D7: \223Air Interface for Fixed and Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems, Multihop Relay Specification\224 3  223WiMAX System Evaluation Methodology\224, Version 1.0, WiMAX Forum, 01/30/2007 4  223Multi-hop Relay System Evaluation Methodology \(Channel Model and Performance Metric\\224, IEEE 802.16 Broadband Wireless Access Working Group, IEEE 802.16j-06/013r3, 02/19/2007 5  Hui Zeng and Chenxi Zhu, \223System-Level Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Multi-hop 802.16j Systems\224, International Wireless Communications and Mobiel Computing Conference 2008 \(IWCMC 2008\ Crete Island, Greece, August 2008 6  Masato Okuda, Chenxi Zhu and Dorin Viorel, \223Multihop Relay Enabled WiMAX Networks: Overview & Benefits of IEEE Draft P802.16j Standard\224, Fujitsu Scientific & Technical Journal \(FSTJ\, special issue on \223Fujitsu\222s Mobile WiMAX Solutions\224, vol. 44, no. 3, July 2008 7  E.
