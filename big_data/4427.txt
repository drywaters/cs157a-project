Extraction and Confirmation of Rules for Human Decision Making  Wang Li   Wang Mingzhe  Department of Control Science and Control Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China 9527cn@163.com   ABSTRACT: Translating knowledge discovered from a database to the form of rule-based repr esentation is a critical step for human decision making. In order to realize such key step, firstly an approach of using the concept lattice to extract the association rules is proposed. Moreover, the previous extracted rules are integrated with decision makerís subjective preference information to confirm the desirable rules set. Finally, an illustration is presented to demo nstrate the above processes in detail KEYWORDS: Decision Making; Rule Extraction; Concept Lattice; Preference Information I   I NTRODUCTION  Generally speaking, human decision making are made on the basis of available knowledge and the preferences of the decision maker. Therefore, knowledge and experience representation is a critical component for human decision making, how to translate knowledge discovered from data sets to the format of a rule-based system is a critical stets. As a power method for analyzing data, formal concept analysis has been extensively applied in knowledge discovery to extract rules based on the formal context of the concept lattice [1 In a d d iti o n  sin c e th e ex t r a c t e d ru l e s m a y h a v e  multiple and conflict attributes, the optimal rules can be obtained by confirming these attributes for its usefulness of preference decision [2  In  th is  w a y   th e des i r a b l e ru l e s  s e t  can be identified grounded on the integration of the objective information which the previous extracted rules hold and the decision makerís subjective preference information The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows Section 001\012 discusses the extraction of rules based on the formal concept analysis. In section 001\013 the priority sequence of these rules will be confirmed according to the given preference information. An example is presented in section 001\014 followed by the conclusion II  R ULES E XTRACTION  In this section, the basic definitions of concept lattice and the processes for extracting rules are described in detail A  Basic Definitions A concept lattice is formed by lots of formal concepts in a formal context. A series of definitions of the concept lattice theory can be listed as follows [1     Definition 1 A formal context  K UAR   consists of an object set U an attribute set A and a relation R UA 002 The element x of U is called the object, and the element y of A is called the attribute If the object x has the attribute y it can be written as xRy or   xy R 003 For XU 002 and YA 002 we define      XyAxXxRy 003 004\003       YxUyYxRy 003 004\003    Definition 2 Given a pair  CXY  on the formal context  K UAR  if  XY satisfies with  XUY AX Y 002\002  and  YX  then  CXY  is called a formal concept X and Y are called the extent and the intent of the concept C and the sets of all extents or intents is denoted by  E XC or  I NC respectively. The set of all concepts of the context K is denoted by  L K    Definition 3 For any concept 111  CXY   222   CXYLK 003 the partial ordering relation  005 is defined as  11 2 2 1 2 1 2     X YXY XXorYY 005\006\002 007    Definition 4 A decision formal context is a quintuple    M UW SDT     UW S and   UDT are the formal context U is the object set W or D is the attribute set of conditions or decision WDA  000 for the formal context  K UAR  respectively; the relations S or T satisfy SUW 002 or TUD 002    Definition 5 For a binary formal context  K UAR  given m objects and n attributes, constructing a mn   m and n are natural number\ matrix B which corresponds to the formal context  1 2  1 2  ij bi mj n  expresses the element in ith row and jth column of the matrix 1 ij b  if the object i has the attribute j  otherwise 0 ij b     Definition 6 Given a mn  matrix B which corresponds to the formal context, matrix  B  denotes the transpose of B and a diagonal matrix 1 2   n y y y 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 010  12   n yy y are the n

Given the linguistic judgment matrix  ij Pp nn   and an alternative set   1 2  i Xxi n   ij p is the preference information provided by the decision maker, it denotes the alternatives i x being compared with the alternative j x  1 2  j n   ij p S   S denotes a previously defined linguistic term set, there existing 2 ii t p s  and ij k p s   ji k Neg p s    Neg means a negation operator Introducing the concept of linguistic 2-tuple    kk s 015  where k s is a linguistic term and k 015 is a numeric value representing the symbolic translation. Let 0 k t   be the result of an aggregation of the indices of a set of labels assessed in a linguistic term set S the 2-tuple that expresses the equivalent information to k  is obtained with the following function [5  0  0  5  0.5 tS      0.5 0.5 kk kkk kk k round sk s k  015 015 015      1 where   round is the usual rounding operation And there is always a function 1    rns it s  equivalent numerical value from a 2-tuple 1  0.5 0.5 0  St     1   kk k k sk 015\015       2 Based on the above functions of  and 1   the fuzzy preference relation matrix  ij n n Ff   can be obtained from the linguistic judgment matrix  ij n n Pp   6 111     1,2    1,2 ij ij ij ij ij Neg pp ppijn ij pij n f   012 012=\012 3 Given an alternative set   1 2  i Xxi n  and an attribute set   1 2  j R rj m   n and m are natural number, the decision matrix can be denoted as    0  ij n m ij Uu u   where ij u means the utility of the attribute j r that pertain to the alternative i x In order to measure all attribute values in dimensionless units and facilitate inter-attribute comparisons, the decision matrix needs to be normalized to get its normalization matrix  ij n m Vv    For benefit attributes  min    max    min    ij j j nj ij jjnj jjnj uuuu v uu u uu u 12 12 12    4 For cost attributes max    max    min    jjnjij ij jjnj jjnj uu u u v uu u uu u 12 12 12    5 Adopting the additive weighting method, the value i k of an alternative i x used to be ranked can be written as 1 m iijj j kv     1 2  in  6 where 0 j    1 1 m j j     j  expresses the weight of the attribute j  Thus, the fuzzy preference relation ij f of ij p is an estimate of the following equation [7   ij i i j f kkk   1 2 ij n  7 So, the deviation degree between j p i and   ii j kk k  can be written as  ij ij i j i dfkkk    8 According to the equation \(8\6 an d 8 c o n s tru c ted  the following optimization model to assess the attribute weights  22 min      nn nn m m ij ij il jl l il l ij ij l l Ldfvvv  1 1 1 1 1 1     s.t 0 l    1 1 m l l    9 and the optimum weight vector   is written as 11 12          TT m Qe eQe        s.t 0 j     1 1 m j j     10 where, \(1,1,...,1 T e   lh m m Qq   and

The targetsí tracks generated by a radar sensor are the input data which are characterized by the attributes of target instantaneous position, speed and direction. The target identification is gained through comparing some allowed values of thresholds with some target parameters. These thresholds are: the maximum speed allowed for a target passing in the area under surveillance without representing a threat situation, the minimum distance allowed between the target position and the bounds of the off-limit region. In addition, a Boolean variable denoting whether or not the target is approaching the offlimit region and a state representing War \(W\Peace \(P time are used to make the decision. In this way, the target identification is classified to three kinds: Neutral \(N Suspect \(S\d Threat \(T\get T ABLE 1  T HE  DECISION TABLE OF CONFIRMING TARGET TYPE  N o  State Distance is smaller than threshold Approac hing the off-limit region Speed is greater than threshold Target type a b c d e f g h i j    k W P yes no yes no yes no N S T 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 3 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 4 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 5 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 6 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 7 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 The decision control structure of classifying target based on logic rules is presented in a decision table, as the table 1 In the table 1, the Boolean variable 0 or 1 is used to express the objective information about the conditions or actions of a decision. It is easy to see that the table 1 takes on the decision formal context in concept lattice theory: the rows of the table are labeled by objects, columns by attributes; a Boolean variable 1 in row x and column y means that the object x has the attribute y; the attributes of     abcde f gh are the attributes of condition, and the attributes of   ijk are the attributes of decision. Therefore some rules can be extracted In terms of the table 1, the matrix B and 010 that corresponds to the formal context can be obtained, and the matrix  H BB 010 can be computed as 0  0 acehk cek ach ae ce eh cek bcegk c eg bceg be bg ach c ad f h j a j c j h f H ae eg a j adge j eg j de d j ce bceg cj egj bcegj be bg eh be h de be bdehi bdi bg f dg bg bdi bd f g j                                      000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000¨\000  So, according to the matrix H a basic concept set can be obtained; and a concept lattice representing by the form of Hass Diagram can be created, as the figure 2   Figure 2: The complete concept lattice Finding out the concepts which contain both attributes of condition and decision and whose parent nodes only contain the attributes of condition. These concepts represented by 9 10\ and \(11\The values of the support and confidence of the above nodes of concepts are expressed in the table 2. We specify the support threshold i 011 and the confidence threshold i 013 are 0.25 and 0.5, respectively T ABLE 2  T HE SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE VALUES OF EACH NODE  Node \(7 8 9 10\ \(11 i 011 0.667 0.667 0.667 0.5 1 i 013 0.286 0.286 0.286 0.286 0.286 The extracted rules can be displayed in the table 3.

Furthermore, an optimal method is used to confirm the ranking consequence of the rules. In this way, both the objective information represented by the extracted rules and subjective information represented by the decision makerís preference can be considered for human decision making to respond to the complex situation, such as time pressure, incomplete data, lack of domain knowledge, and so on A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(No 60874068  R EFERENCES  1  W.

For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is çProblem solvingé. Second in the ranking for students is çElementary computing skillsé. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageé and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with çPersonal skillsé rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by çProfessional skillsé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çInternationalisationé and Entrepreneurshipé. The smallest mean çInternationalisation is just over midway between çweaké and çconsiderableé. Given the European Unionês desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that çProfessional skillsé are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by çPersonal sk illsé and Interpersonal skillsé. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn.
