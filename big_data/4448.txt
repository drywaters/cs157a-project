In this paper we propose a new 
association rules mining algorithm, TB-SCM, which is based on Transaction Bool Matrix and Support Count Matrix, for predicting trend in futures prices to meet this challenge. Here, our algorithm mainly considers the preprocessing and analyzing of data We develop a novel time series association rules mining prototype system based on the TB-SCM algorithm and C++ STL technology, and investigate the efficiency of the system using West Texas Intermediate WTI\de oil futures prices time series listed on the Energy Information Administration \(EIA\bsite, as well as Shanghai Futures Ex change \(SHFE futures\222 closing prices time series on hexun website. The empirical study shows that TB-SCM algorithm 
out-perform classical Apri ori algorithm available in Weka data mining software which is developed by Waikato University in terms of generating time series association rules without redundancy  Keywords: association rules, data mining, futures prices predicting, time series  1 Introduction  Futures prices time series has its own particularity besides the universal characteristics of data sets, and its volatility makes prediction a challenging task, whereas the analysis of it has always been a hotspot of Economics and Statistics as its findings is essential in the formulation of exact pricing and the decision-making Presently, a great deal of effort has been devoted to 
developing time series predicting models   Well-established and applied techniques include: \(a linear models, such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average \(ARIMA 4 b\non-linear models such as the Artificial Neural Networks \(ANN  fuzzy system models and Support Vector Machines SVM  c\mbination of linear and non-linear models 1  Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying data mining technology to time series analysis Mining association rules 
14 as one of the important topics in data mining, aimed at finding interesting relationships between items from data sets, the rules found can not only describe the law of the related data objects\222 historical development, but also can be used to predict the future development trend according to the current status of the data objects. Thus, the exploratory research of applying the as sociation rules approach to discover the potential, useful pattern from time series is of great significance in trend predicting  In the futures market, the association rules mining can be used to find the linkage relations between different futures, common 
rules found can be described as \223In a certain time frame if WTI \(West Texas Intermediate\crude oil price rises then the possibility of SHFE \(Shanghai Futures Exchange\fuel oil price rises at the same time is 80%\224 however, investors may be more interested in this kind of rules like \223In a certain time frame, if WTI crude oil and SHFE fuel oil prices rise on the first day, and WTI crude oil price falls, but SHFE fuel oil price rises on the second day, then the possibility of SHFE fuel oil price falls on the third day is 80%\224. Rules in the second form, called time series association rules contain more information as the former and latter cases of the rules have time constraints, and are more important in making invest decisions In this paper, after study the exist literatures of 
association rules mining algorithm or related 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 we realize this idea and introduce a novel algorithm TB-SCM which is based on Transaction Bool Matrix and Support Count Matrix for extracting time series association rules in a more effective way without redundancy. This approach first discrete the prices time series with a user-defined threshold that define the up, fair and down trend of prices then carry out data preprocess with a sliding time window. After preprocessing the algorithm carries on finds the time series associa tion rules and displays them in a visual way The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 introduces the time series association rules 
mining algorithm TB-SCM. In section 3, experiments and results are described in detail using WTI Crude oil futures and SHFE fuel oil futures prices.

1512  2 Algorithm  The process of data mining includes data preprocessing, data mining, model evaluation and knowledge representation. In this section, we first introduce the method of futures prices time series preprocessing, then describe the novel algorithm TB-SCM, which involves the last three phrase of data mining  2.1 Data preprocessing Suppose we have a time series data set DS={T P1 P2 205 Pn}, where T is time, Pi>0\(i 1 nts a price of a certain futures, eac h record is composed of T j  a value of T, and every futures\222 price under T j Futures P\222s prices under T j and T j-1 is P[T j   P T j-1  th en  If P[T j  T j-1  futures P\222s incident under T j is 223up\224 If P[T j P[T j-1  futures P\222s incident under T j 223fair\224 If P[T j   P T j-1  futures P\222s incident under T j  is \223down\224  Here 0 is a user-defined va lue. After discretion we get a new data set DS T P1 P2 205 Pn'}, where T j is the same as in DS, Pi' is futures P\222s incident under time T j up, fair, down  Consider the sample data set containing 8 records in Tab.1. Let 2, after discretion, we get a new data set containing 7 records, see in Tab.2. In the new data set we link the futures\222 name and its incident by \223:\224 to form an item, different items generated by different futures are separated by a comma  Tab.1 Sample data set Time P1 P2 1 32 22 2 30 25 3 33 25 4 37 28 5 40 26 6 38 23 7 35 27 8 39 30  Tab.2 Data discretion Time Items 1 2 P1:down,P2:up 3 P1:up P2:fair 4 P1:up P2:up 5 P1:up P2:down 6 P1:down, P2:down 7 P1:down P2:up 8 P1:up P2:up  Time Sliding Window \(STW\is composed of w property values under consecutive time points, recorded as STW S T W  2  205, S T W  w  Al l t h e pr op ert y  values in the time sliding window consist of a Sliding Time Transaction Set \(STTS\and STTS={1:STW  2:STW 205, w ST W w  t h e  p r efi x n u m b er indentifies the position of the item in the time sliding window. If ST  1 i w\has more than one item, then its prefix number will be assigned to each of them Consider the data set in Tab.2, let w=3, and there are 5 time sliding windows Win1, Win2, Win3, Win4 Win5. Each time sliding window covers 3 time points consist of 3 property values, see in Fig.1  Fig.1 Time sliding window   All the property values in a window make up a sliding time transaction set, so we get 5 records after processing, see in Tab.3  Tab.3 Sliding time transaction set Items P1:down,1:P2:up,2:P1:up,2 P2:fair,3:P1:up,3:P2:up P1:up,1:P2:fair,2:P1:up,2 P2:up,3:P1:up,3:P2:down P1:up,1:P2:up,2:P1:up,2:P2 down,3:P1:down,3:P2:down P1:up,1:P2:down,2:P1:down,2:P2:down,3:P1:down,3:P2:up P1:down,1:P2:down,2:P1:dow n,2:P2:up,3:P1:up,3:P2:up  2.2 Time series association rules mining The data structures mainly used by TB-SCM are Transaction Bool Matrix and Support Count Matrix Transaction Bool Matrix  TBM\ is an N\327M matrix, where N is the total record number of the data set and M is the number of items involved in it. If item I j is contained by transaction T i then the value of TBM   is 1, otherwise, its value is 0. For every itemset, we introduce two fields support index and support count where the index is composed of values 0 and 1, the i th value of it indicates whether the i th record in the data set contains this itemset or not. For example, we have a 14-record data set \(see in Fig.2\, consider itemset {I1 its support index {I1}.index=10011011110011, and I2}.index=11110101101011, and their s upport count can be obtained by simply calculating the number of 1 appear in the index, such as {I1}.SupportCount=9 Time Items  2 P1:down,P2:up Win1   3 P1:up,P2:fair Win2   4 P1:up,P2:up Win3  5 P1:up,P2:down Win4  6 P1:down,P2:down   Win5 7 P1:down,P2:up   8 P1:up,P2:up 


1513  I2}.SupportCount=10, while through the logic \223and\224 operation of {I1}.index and {I2}.index, we can easily get the index of another composition itemset, e.g I1,I2}.index {I1}.index&{I2}.index=10010001100011  TID Items TID I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I6 I7 I8 I9 T101 I1,I2,I5,I6,I9 T101 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 T102 I2,I4,I8  T102 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 T103 I2,I3,I7,I9  T103 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 T104 I1,I2,I4  T104 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 T105 I1,I3,I4,I6,I8 T105 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 T106 I2,I3,I6,I9  T106 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 T107 I1,I3,I6,I7  T107 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 T108 I1,I2,I3,I5,I8 T108 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 T109 I1,I2,I3,I9  T109 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 T110 I1,I3,I6,I9  T110 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 T111 I2,I5,I7,I9  T111 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 T112 I3,I5,I7  T112 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 T113 I1,I2,I4,I7  T113 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 T114 I1,I2,I5,I8  T114 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 Fig.2 Sample data set and transaction bool matrix  Support Count Matrix \(SCM\ M\327M upper triangular matrix, whose rows and columns are identified by the names of items, and M means the same as in TBM Thus, the element in row i and column j can be mark as SCM[I i  I j  nd its val u e represe n ts Item I j 222s appear times as suffix of item I i All the items involved in SCM matrix\222s rows and columns are arranged by dictionary order. Consider the data set in Fig.2, its Support Count Matrix is in Fig.3 Fig.3 Support count matrix  TB-SCM algorithm uses the fundamental nature of frequent itemsets, that is, \223All the none-empty subsets of frequent itemsets must be frequent\224 and \223None of the super-sets of nonfrequent itemsets can be frequent\224. The process of the algorithm see in Fig. 4   The algorithm works through three steps step1: Create the Support Count Matrix and Transaction Bool Matrix. Initial the two matrixes TBM and SCM, and scan each record of the data set and update them according to the items appearance in the record  Fig.4 Process of TB-SCM  CreateMatrix TBM, SCM, T     Initial  SC M[M][M  M is the number of items involved and N is the number of the record sets for each record T i dataset  T i is the i th record of the dataset process current record update the i th row in TBM       for each item I j I j is the j th column of TBM  if I j T i T i contains I j  then   1   else TBM[i  j     0    update SCM, the rows and columns of SCM are  identified by the items For each item I k T i  SCM[I k  I k  I k  I k 1  process the suffix of I k in T i  For each \(I h T i  k    SCM[I k  I h  I k  I h       step2: Find all the frequent Itemsets meet the requirement that the first item\222s prefix number must be 2231\224 in every frequent itemset.

1515  The current pricing adjustment mechanism for refined oil in China is adjusted by the National Development and Reform Commission in accordance with the prices of New Yo rk, Singapore and Rotterdam therefore, the oil price in China is mainly impacted by the three places\222 oil prices, including the WTI Crude oil futures, which is one of the three crude oil benchmarks in New York Mercantile Exchange. Our experiment will give some proofs about this After preprocessing \(the of WTI is 0.2, SHFE is 2 time window width is 3\we have 601 instances. We set the min_sup and min_conf as 0.05 and 0.70, and discover 15 time series asso ciation rules. See in Fig.7 The first time series association rule found is 1:SHFE:up,1:WTI:down,2:SHFE:down,2:WTI:up 3:SHFE:up[support=6.32%,confidence=84  This rule indicates that if SHFE fuel oil futures price is up and WTI Crude o il futures price is down on the first day, and on the second day SHFE is down and WTI is up, then on the third day SHFE is up\222s support is 6.32%, confidence is 84.4%. We can also find that all the latter cases in the rules found are about SHFE, that means the SHFE fuel oil futures price has a strong correlation with the WTI Crude oil futures price For comparison, we conduct another experiment using the same data set in Weka data mining software which is developed by Waikato University, the results are show in Fig.8. Check these rules, such as \223101 2=WTI:up 3=SHFE:down 3=WTI:down 47 2=SHFE:up 33    conf:\(0.7\\224\(where 47 is support count of items contained in the former case, 33 is the whole rules\222 items support count\his rule predicts the second day\222s trend by the incident of the third day, it\222s not practical, hence this rule is redundant. Out of the 101 rules found by Weka, we can find 15 rules useful the same as in our system     This shows that our Time Series Association Rules Mining System based on TB-SCM algorithm is more effective, it can generate tim e series association rules without redundancy  4 Summary and future work  This paper presented a novel association rules mining algorithm TB-SCM for mining futures prices time series association rules, it\222s more effective than the classical Apriori, and can generate the aimed rules without redundancy  Futures market has not only a large amount of data but also a considerable number of real-time data opportunities are fleeting, how to timely discover the relevant rules, and how to find the new rules without re-mining the whole data set when data is updated is of great importance. Therefore, the next step of our research work is to realize the dynamic updates and incremental association rules mining  Fig.7 Results

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
