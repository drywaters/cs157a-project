The main responsibility of any HR Personnel is to propose right talent pool to the interviewers to save their time in selecting the right talent for their organization. In the talent pool set up phase, HR faces the problem of making a decision whether to include the applicant into talent pool or not. Many HR Tools are available to support the decision making of HR Personnel. However, the accuracy of decision making still can not satisfy the HR personnel. Here, we proposed a two tier intelligent based architecture consisting of talent evaluation engine that acts on knowledge base constituted by domain experts and infers the pattern needed to make more consistent and accurate decision. Also, we implemented the intelligent resume processing method which is really helpful in making a decision more perfect. The practical implementation of our system shows that accuracy of ta lent evaluation is very much improved. Our proposed system increases the job performance, reduces retention failure and explicit resignation Keywords: Knowledge manage ment in HR - Talent evaluation – InterProlog Infe rence Mechanism- Intelligent resume processing I   LITERATURE  SURVEY  With the increasing number of job portals, it become mandatory for the HR personnel to use more accurate talent evaluation applications for finding right workforce to their company. For any business, it is very important to have competitive multi talented workforce human resource for tackling any economic challenges  Most of the talent evaluation applications are based on the data mini  2    fuzzy clustering [3 ne ur o an d ro u g h set t h eo ry 5    However, it is difficult for HR personnel to use these methods at early stage of selection. Any wrong decision of HR, the selection may go wrong and can add up wasted training expenses for the company. Recently, a number of studies have been proposed to evaluate the talent of applicant and recruit the people for the right job based on the evaluation. We have conducted investigation on talent evaluation systems and architecture that can be matched with our proposed system. A HR talent evaluation system  i s c o nst r uc t e d by i n t e g r at i n g t h e  dat a  m i ni ng m e t hods  such as association rule and decision tree. Most of the association rules are inferred from the available facts in database. Sometimes a valid association rule may be missed due to poor support and confidence for that rule. Hybrid data mining technique [3  6 has be en a d o p t e d  i n  semiconductor manufacturing for solving engineering and yield problem. Only few studies have been done for talent evaluation. Other than the data mining such as neural network, support vector machine and statistical methods [4  are block boxes to the decision makers. This type of system is not particularly useful for the human resource management application  II  DIFFERENT  COMPONENTS  OF  TWO  TIER INTELLIGENT  AGENT  BASED  ARCHITECTURE  According to different functionality, our proposed architecture can be divided into two main phase Back End Figure 1\ and Front End \(Figure 2  A.Back End Phase of Architecture  Two main major modules of the Back End phases are Data pre processing and pattern mining. In this phase we perform Data preprocessing and mining on employee profile of company to capture well known pattern and after that we enrich the patterns as well as add the valid additional rules with the help of domain expert. For any job posting by the recruiter, HR domain expert prepares the valid rules based on his/her expert knowledge and also from the inferred pattern. These valid rules need to be matched with the applicant 1.Data Preprocessing  Mostly human resource data are sensitive and stored in different place. Befo re performing the mining, data preprocessing is required to ensure rich quality data 1.Data Selection We selected the data from the employee profile for assisting the mining. Our mining targets the three important attributes                 Figure 1 Back End Phase Knowledge Base Knowledge Eli c it a ti o n Job Posting HR Domain Experts and Mined Pattern Data Preprocessing Profiles

They are performance of employee, retention failure and explicit resignation. We select the data and load it in the schema show in Table 1   2. Data Cleaning We excluded the attribute such as age, gend er and martial status to avoid discrimination of employees from profile schema 3. Data Enrichment College attribute of Profile is enriched by categorizing the studied colleges into A, B and C category 4.Data Transformation We used the relational table format which confines to the schemas in Table 1 for loading the data. We have developed the performance review component in our system. It analysis the each employees based on the performance attributes such as technical expertise, Team working behavior and interest in knowledge improvement. This component generates the grade value for each employee and stores it in the Performance schema. A retention rate is a critical issue since most of the companies invest a lot on new employee According to HR experience if one employee quits the job within 6 months of probation period then recruitment process is failed and investment training is wasted. We prepared the profile of employee who left the company within 1 year. We recorded reason for the retention failure in the Retention schema. When company employee resigns the job explicitly as of his own, The HR and immediate manager of that employee should interview him and record reason such as internal exit or external pull in the explicit schema  2. HR Domain Experts and Mined Pattern In the mining step of Back End Phase, We applied association rule mining on the loaded data by joining the different schemas. Associat ion rule is the correlation between one set of item with another set of item. During the Association rule mining, candidate rule discovered should satisfy the minimum support of 85% and confidence of 65%.If any candidate rule comes close to support then it is given to domain expert for validation            A java based data mining system is developed to implement the data mining alogirthm.We used Apriori algorithm to analyze all the dataset. Excerpts of interesting patterns inferred from the loaded data source using our method are shown below. By joining the performance and profile schema, we can derive a good employee profile as in the rule1 with excellent supp ort and confidence. With the help of knowledge elicitation component all the mined rules and domain expert contributed rules are translated into prolog notation form and added to knowledge base. The observed piece of evidence can be stored as prolog facts B  Front End Phase of Architecture In the Front End phase of our system as shown in Fig.2 job seeker submits the resume to tagger. it converts the resume to XML tagged resume and all facts extracted from tagged resume are loaded into knowledge base. When a HR Query is received, our Talent Evaluation Inference Engine \(TEIE runs the applicant facts against the rule base formulated in the knowledge base by the Back End. TEIE captures the candidate based on the valid match count and suggest a list to HR Personnel 1 Tagger  It’s is an intelligent resume processing component that acts on the applicant resume and generates the XML tagged resume which is confined to the tagged resume XML DTD XQUERY are executed on XML tagged resume to do the Knowledge Elicitation  2 Talent Evaluation Inference  Engine The main role of the IEIE is to evaluate each applicant resume against already built knowledge base and choose the applicants who attain the maximum number of matches. We formulate the rule base gathered from mining and domain expert in such a way that each applicant resume checked against the rule.TEIE is designed to infer the facts following Top down inference mechanism. Additionally Job seeker can post query to TEIE to find right job opening match to their resume InterProlog provides Java with the ability to call any prolog goal through a prolog object and for prolog to invoke any java method through a java message predicate                     III DATA ANALYSIS REPORT  Our proposed online base system was examined on Vee Technologies company dataset which is affiliated to our college. We tested our Back End of the system on total of 510 employees who hired from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. We traced their performance, rete ntion failures and explicit resignation to explore rules These rules are enriched with the help of domain expert and constructed more precise knowledge base. Here, the Performance of talent evaluation analyzed based on accuracy of talent pool, improvement of Figure 2.

In Vee Technologie s, job seekers need to go through 3 level of interview such as technical, group discussion and HR Accuracy Level Level Original Original Level P 000   1   Level P Captured Candidates by TEIE Level Original Actual candidates selected in Level For the software testing jo b opening, we received 127 applicants resume Out of 127, our Talent Evaluation inference engine narrated to 47 candidates for the interview According to equation 1, graph Fig.3  projected to show selection accuracy % in each interview level.HR Personnel’s are satisfied with 80% above accuracy. In addition, we ha ve analyzed how the job performance, retention failure and explicit resignation parameters are improved fo r the employees who were recruited through our TEIE system on Jan 1 st 2009 as shown in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure.6 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 Software 000\003 Testing\(Applicants=127 Technical 000\003 Interview Group 000\003 Discussion HR 000\003 Interview Accuracy      EXCELLENT AVERAGE POOR 33  14  53      IV CONCLUSION In our paper, we proposed two tier intelligent agent architecture and also suggest ed a tagger for resume Not 000\003 Resigned Resigned 95    Total Sample 9 personal internal 000\003 pressure External 000\003 Salary 000\003 offer External 000\003 Desgination 000\003 offer 60 20 10  10   processing to select and present the right talent to the interviewer. We have shown how our system increases the accuracy, job performance and reduces retention failure and explicit resignations. This practical implementation shows that it really satisfy the HR personnel. In future, we would like to devise a perfect architecture fo r building a knowledge base and let it to serve HR personnel with more excellent accuracy  REFERENCES    C F Chien and L  Chen “Data m i ni ng to improve personnel selection and enhance human cap ital: A Case study in high technology industry” Expert Syst.

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIs   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm.
