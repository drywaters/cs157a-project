The parametric 
model for GCR exposure correlates the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the cutoff rigidity at ISS altitudes while the TR parametric model relates this quantity to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\e influences of solar activity, flux asymmetry inside the SAA, detector orientation, and position aboard the ISS on the dose equivalent have been examined The model has been successfully benchmarked against measured data for GCR and TR exposures to within \26110% and 
26120%, respectively, over periods of time ranging from a single day to a full mission. In addition, preliminary estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been simulated using the PHITS Monte Carlo transport code. These simulations indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent is a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1 I

2   the risks associated with missions aboard the ISS is the increased level of radiation exposure that space-crew will encounter. Each ninety-minute orbit takes the ISS through a low-Earth orbit \(LEO\iation environment that includes galactic cosmic radiation \(GCR\d trapped radiation \(TR as the primary sources of exposure  GCR particles arrive from outside the solar system in an isotropic manner and have flux energy peaks around 0.5 to 1 GeV nuc 1 but can reach energies exceeding 10 6 GeV. The GCR particle spectrum is approximately 98% charged nuclei and 2% electrons. Of the charged nuclei component the majority is composed primarily of hydrogen nuclei 87%\d helium nuclei \(12%\while the remaining 1% are heavy-nuclei [1,2,3,4,5 T R i s popu l a t e d pri m ari l y b y  protons and electrons that have been trapped by Earth\222s internal magnetic field and form the Van Allen Radiation Belts  Trappe d prot on s  h o w e v e r, are t h e  m a i n  contributors to the dose and can reach several hundred MeV in energy. Together, GCR and TR exposures each contribute roughly 50% of the daily absorbed dose space-crew receive aboard the ISS The amount of radiation exposure received from these sources is influenced by numerous factors. The Earth is being constantly bombarded by solar wind which, on account of its charged nature, drags along with it a weak solar magnetic field. This interplanetary magnetic field IMF\mains coupled to the Sun as it is dragged outwards to a distance of approximately 100 AU forming the region known as the heliosphere [2,5 T h e in ten s it y o f t h e so lar  wind and IMF increases during solar active periods. The combination of solar wind and IMF distort the internal magnetic field of the Earth by compressing it on the Sun facing side and dragging it out on the eclipse side. This superposition in turn creates the region known as the magnetosphere As GCR ions approach Earth from outside the solar system they can be deflected as they encounter the solar wind and IMF. Relative to solar minimum conditions the GCR spectrum at solar maximum is hardened, or rather, the GCR flux distribution modulates in an anti-coincident manner with the solar cy on reach ing Earth th es e ions  must penetrate the magnetosphere. The ability of GCR ions to pass through this region in order to reach a particular position \(latitude, longitude, altitude\s dependent on their rigidities [7 h e rig i d ity o f a ch arg e d p a rticle is its ratio o f  momentum per unit charge. Generally, the larger an ion\222s rigidity \(energy\he less it will be deflected or impeded by the influences of the magnetosphere and internal magnetic field. Moreover, due to the distorted nature of the internal field, the ability of ions to penetrate any given position about the Earth will also vary from location to location. The general term used in quantifying the ability of GCR ions to reach a given position around the Earth is called the cutoff rigidity [7   w h ic h e sse ntia ll y d e sc r i b e s t h e  ne c e ssa r y  energy an ion needs The TR environment is more dynamic than the GCR environment. TR exposures in LEO occur primarily within the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\. The SAA is an area of weakened magnetic field strength over the South Atlantic that allows trapped ions in the inner Van Allen belt to mirror at lower altitudes than in other regions Trapped ions approach to within an altitude of 200 km in this region [6,8,9,10 A s t h e orbi t of t h e IS S pass es through the SAA, space-crew are subjected to increased radiation exposure from the trapped protons. The majority of the TR exposure space-crew receive are from passes through the SAA The level of solar activity also modulates the amount of TR exposures. At solar maximum conditions, the intensity of extreme ultraviolet radiation \(EUV\itted by the Sun relative to solar minimum conditions increases. The increase in EUV radiation causes a corresponding increase in atmospheric density at all altitudes. As the trapped ions in the SAA approach the Earth\222s atmosphere, they may interact through collisional processes and be lost from the trapped radiation environment. Additionally, the increase in atmospheric density can result in increased ion loss through these collisional processes. Thus, TR exposure is also anticoincident with the solar cycle  Currently, in preparation for expeditions to the ISS common practice requires a pre-mission assessment of the predicted radiation absorbed dose that crew will experience throughout the mission. This evaluation is required by the Radiation Health Working Group \(RHWG\ltilateral Medical Operations Panel \(MMOP\ and is intended to ensure that the crew will not exceed allowable levels of dose for any given mission. The pre-mission assessment currently carried out for ISS expeditions relies on empirically determined mean dose rates obtained from Crew Personal Dosimeters \(CPDs\nd Radiation Area Monitors \(RAMs These mean dose rates are used for future projections of the next mission Empirically-based measurements collected aboard the U.S Space Shuttle and Mir Space Station have also been used as the basis of predictive models. Golightly et al   demonstrated that the trapped dose rate aboard the U.S Space Shuttle can be related to the atmospheric density in units of g cm 3 with a power law relationship proportional to 0.9 Badhwar et al 12 a l so ill u s trated th at t h e trap p e d  radiation environment can be expressed by a power law relationship with the atmospheric density. Later, Badhwar  e x a m i n e d th e T L D data aboard th e U.S. Space Shuttle and proposed a modified relationship that better fit the data. In this work, analysis of the six different TLD locations showed a clear dist inction between the predicted trapped dose rates due to localized shielding effects. This latter model demonstrated an ability to predict the trapped radiation dose aboard the Space Shuttle to within 30% of measured daily values with the majority of predictions within 10% [14 A p a ram e tric f it relati n g  th e d a il y  absorbed dose rate from GCR exposures was also developed

The deceleration parameter is given in units of MV, as it is proportional to the rigidity of GCR ions, and arose as a part of the solution modeling for the diffusion of these ions through the solar wind plasma an h i s  parametric model was shown to be different for varying orbital inclinations of 28.45 373 51.65 373 and 57.00 373  i t h a n  overall ability to predict the GCR contribution to absorbed dose \(aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle\within 15 Though not related to space-crew dosimetry, a code for aircrew exposure assessment has been developed which utilized actual measurements as the basis for a semiempirical model. The Predictive Code for Aircrew Radiation Exposure \(PCAire\s based on TEPC measurements from 62 world-wide flights, spanning a range from 50 373 south latitude to 85 373 north latitude and up to an altitude of 12.4 km [16,17  Utilizin g k n o w led g e o f th e  ground position of the aircraft throughout the flights, the authors developed correlations relating the dose equivalent rates, measured by the onboard TEPC, against the vertical cut-off rigidity R c interpolated from the aircraft position The model also accounted for solar modulation effects and changes in atmospheric density. The PCAire code has the ability for predicting the route dose within 20% [16,17   The objective of this paper is the development of a semiempirical model to predict the operational quantity of dose equivalent that space-crew will receive aboard the ISS from GCR and TR sources. Similar to the aircraft model, this model utilizes operational data collected aboard the ISS by the U.S. tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\rom 2000 to 2010 and is correlated to the various physical phenomena that influence the radiation exposure. The parametric model is then incorporated into a usable code and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. In addition to providing a measure of the operational quantity of dose equivalent, an assessment of the biologically-relevant effective dose equivalent is also made The effective dose equivalent incorporates tissue weighting factors, in addition to radiation weighting factors, to account for the overall effect on the human body. The TEPC dose equivalent is converted into an effective dose equivalent using estimations of ambient dose equivalent-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors obtained from simulations with the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System \(PHITS H I T S  is a t h ree di m e n s ion a l g e n e ral  purpose Monte Carlo code capable of transporting a wide range of particles and particle energies through complex geometries. Throughout the following sections, the reader is referred to Ref.

These chosen years closely approximate maximum and minimum solar activity and allow for accommodation of the changing solar modulation conditions. The remaining data from 2000, 2002 to 2007, 2009, and 2010 were set aside for use in model benchmarking. Within the period of 2003 to 2006, however several inconsistencies in the TEPC were identified. In 2003 the TEPC did not collect data. Furthermore, from 2004 to 2006, the TEPC experienced some saturation and overwrite errors which were no  T h eref ore, on l y th e  data from 2000, 2002, 2007, 2009 and 2010 are used for model benchmarking. The TEPC data used for the model development includes, for a given minute, the absorbed dose rate and dose equivalent rate along with ISS position vector in coordinates of longitude, latitude, and altitude. The radiation type causing the exposure \(GCR or TR\s included and determined by means of a dose-rate threshold Exposures resulting from solar flares are ignored in the current analysis. In addition, the location of the TEPC aboard the ISS at the time of measurement is also recorded 2.2 \226 Galactic Cosmic Radiation Parametric Model The cutoff rigidity R c is a quantity which expresses the ability of ions to penetrate to a given position about the Earth o r th is cu rre n t  w o r k th e  m easu r ed dos e equivalent rates are correlated to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity as interpolated from ISS state vectors. To approximate the cutoff rigidity, the Smart and Shea RCINTUT3 code is utilized to generate world maps of the cutoff rigidity values [7,22,23 e to th e en or m i t y o f the GCR data sets, several simplifications were made to account for the variations in the cutoff rigidity as a function of time of day and magnetic disturbance. These simplifications were necessary because the model development requires a linear interpolation of the cutoff rigidity at a given position latitude, longitude, and altitude\d level of magnetic disturbance. Having to assess different maps for each position vector and the associated Kp index would have presented considerable difficu lty. Therefore, using the RCINTUT3 code, 5 272 327 5 272 world grids of the effective vertical cut-off rigidity parameter were developed for altitudes ranging from 300 \226 500 km in 25 km intervals. For each altitude step six maps were developed, each assuming a different Kp index with values ranging from 0 to 5 inclusive, that were then averaged. This Kp averaging procedure was then performed repeatedly at each altitude but for varying universal times in increments of 3 hours from 00:00:00 UT to 21:00:00 UT inclusive. For each 


4   altitude block, the maps were then averaged over the UT spectrum. Ultimately, through this procedure, nine maps were developed in total that were averaged over a Kp range 0 to 5 and a UT range of 0 hour to 21 hour, and for altitudes ranging from 300 km to 500 km in 25 km blocks Figure 1 shows a Kp- and UT-averaged effective vertical cutoff rigidity map at 400 km. Using the ISS state vectors latitude, longitude, and altitude\alues of the cut-off rigidity were then interpolated. The measured dose equivalent rate was then correlated to these interpolated values. The data were then parsed according to the TEPC location at the time of data collection, and for each module location the data were separated into altitude ranges of 25 km. By treating the data in this way, localized shielding effects and altitude dependencies could be assessed   Figure 1. Mean effective vertical cutoff rigidity averaged over 0 UT to 21 UT in 3 hr increments at 400 km altitude units in GV   Figure 2. Mean effective vertical cutoff rigidity averaged over 0 UT to 21 UT in 3 hr increments at 400 km altitude units in GV A representative scatter plot of the measured TEPC dose equivalent rate plotted against the effective vertical cutoff rigidity is illustrated in Figure 2 which shows TEPC data collected in 2001 for an altitude range of 375 to 400 km while positioned at SM-327. For each module data set, the spread in the measured TEPC dose equivalent rates was found to be quite large due to the statistics in the data. The spread is largest at low cutoff rigidity values \(i.e. at higher latitudes\he uncertainty in each dose measurement is dependent on the number of counts observed by the TEPC over the counting time of one minute. Unfortunately, the standard deviations in the raw measurements were not available to assess such uncertainty. Therefore, for this analysis, the data was pre-processed and smoothed by binning the data and taking the mean of the measured dose rates within each bin. The standard deviation was then utilized to weight each mean with a non-linear regression fit of the data. This analysis was performed for the entire dataset for years 2001 and 2008. For each year, fits were developed for each module. The obtained fit is given by Eq 1\here TEPC H is the TEPC dose equivalent rate in \265Sv min 1 for GCR exposures R c is the effective vertical cutoff rigidity in GV, and a  and b are the fitted coefficients   1 GCR 1.5 TEPC c HabR 212   1 Altitude Dependence \226 Figure 3 is a representative figure which illustrates the model fits for the TEPC located at SM327 for solar maximum conditions in 2001. The smoothed data points and associated standard errors of the means are also shown. Several general observations can be made from this analysis. The highest observed TEPC dose equivalent rates are at low cutoff rigidities, which correspond to high latitudes. At high latitudes, the Earth\222s magnetic field lines begin approaching the magnetic dipoles perpendicular to the Earth\222s surface. Because the force experienced by an ion due to an external magnetic field is given by the cross product of the instantaneous ion velocity with the field, the ions incident to the magnetic field lines at the poles will experience little-to-no force giving rise to a greater dose rate. On the other hand, at the equator, the magnetic field lines are nearly parallel to the Earth\222s surface which will yield a lower dose rate due to greater geomagnetic shielding  Figure 3. GCR parametric fits as a function of altitude for the TEPC located at Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\uring solar maximum conditions \(2001 TEPC Data With regard to the influence that altitude has on the absorbed TEPC dose equivalent rate, a slight dependency was observed among the various parametric fits Specifically, it is noticed that an increase in altitude results in a slight increase in TEPC dose equivalent rate, where it is more significant at low cutoff rigidity values. The fits were also seen to converge at high rigidities. Since only the most 


002 002 5   energetic GCR ions can penetrate the higher rigidity regions, the small variations in geomagnetic shielding experienced at ISS altitude are shown to be insignificant Between any two altitude ranges, the smoothed data were within a single standard deviation of each other for each TEPC location. The spread of the data is such that the binned data cannot be statistically separated from one another Localized Shielding Dependence 226 Figure 4 is a representative figure for various TEPC locations throughout 2001 for an altitude range of 375 km to 400 km. Minor variations in the absorbed dose rates between separate modules and module panels were observed. The most pronounced variations occur at low rigidity values. This observation is supported by other work, which modeled the GCR flux distribution inside the European Columbus module  T h ere i t  w a s de m ons t rat ed t h at t h e  shielding acts to harden the incident proton component of the GCR flux by attenuating the lower-energy ions Therefore, because the dose deposited at higher rigidities is due to higher-energy ions, any shielding dissimilarities between two different modules \(or module panels\ot expected to transl ate into a greatly differing dose rate Overall the magnitude of the variances in dose rates is generally less than 0.1 \265Sv min 1 In addition, it is difficult to differentiate localized shielding effects within the scatter of the data. Therefore, although parametric fits do indicate a slight localized shielding dependency, the scatter in the raw data does not justify taking into account such effects  Figure 4. GCR parametric fit localized shielding dependencies at solar maximum conditions \(2001 TEPC Data\or an altitude range of 375 km to 400 km including standard error on the means of the raw data Parametric Model Development \226 Considering that only minor altitude and localized shielding dependencies were observed for the GCR dose rates, it was therefore decided to combine the entire TEPC data sets for 2001 \(solar maximum conditions\d for 2008 \(solar minimum conditions Figure 5 illustrates the GCR parametric fits given by Eq. \(2 and Eq. \(3\here MAX GCR H and MIN GCR H are the TEPC dose equivalent rates in units of \265Sv min 1 for solar maximum and minimum conditions respectively R c is the effective vertical cutoff rigidity in GV, and U is the heliocentric potential in MV For moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential U can be used as a metric to linearly interpolate between the two curves. The heliocentric potential, given in units of MV, is similar to the deceleration parameter. It arises from a steady-state solution of the GCR diffusion equation through the solar wind. Unlike the deceleration parameter, the heliocentric potential does not include a time delay. This parameter is readily updated by the Federal Aviation Administration \(FAA   MIN GCR GCR MAX TEPC GCR GCR c c c  3.97 GV  819 MV 3.97 GV   298 MV 3.97 GV HR U HHR U HR       1 MAX 1.5 GCR c 1 MIN 1.5 GCR c MIN MAX GCR GCR GCR 1.4903 0.1621 1.1322 0.2073 12 HR HR HHH 212 212      3  Figure 5.

With an increase in cutoff rigidity, the measured dose rates for maximum and minimum solar conditions are seen to approach each other i.e., beyond a rigidity of 3.97 GV, the predicted dose equivalent rate is independent of solar modulation 2.3 \226 Trapped Radiation Parametric Model The parametric model for trapped radiation exposure is based on a correlation between the daily mean TEPC dose equivalent rate, in units of \265Sv min 1 and the daily mean atmospheric density, in units of g cm 3 for all crossings over the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\. It has been previously shown that this correlation would result in a power-law relationship [12,13,1   T h e U  S N a va l Re se a r c h  Laboratory Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter atmospheric density model for year 2000 \(NRLMSIS-00 was utilized in this work. This model was specifically implemented in a MATLAB script by the French aerospace   2

The solar activity indices are accounted for by the solar radio flux at 10.7 cm \(F107\he 81-day mean solar radio flux F81\, and the Ap magnetic index. These latter parameters can be obtained from the National Geophysical Data Center operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA  In order to improve the quality of the fit, an initial preprocessing of the TEPC data was performed. The TEPC data was first parsed according to the regular periodicity of ISS crossings over the SAA rather than by UT clock-date in order to account for the precession of the ISS over the SAA This corrected for the skew in the typical mean daily dose rates resulting from the precession. The data were also segmented according to TEPC location and by the orientation of the detector  In previous work, localized shielding dependencies were observed by Badhwar who determined that the trapped radiation dose rate varied more importantly \(compared to the GCR contribution\ about the U.S. Space Shuttle [14 L a stl y d a ta co llected d u rin g  periods of Shuttle dockings were also removed from the dataset as the large mass of the vessel and change in ISS attitude would influence the measured values  Figure 6. TEPC located in SM-327 during December 2008 [20   For 2001 and 2008, the only TEPC locations that coincided between both years were SM-327, SM-338, and SM-STBD In order to gather an appropriate atmospheric density range that covers an entire solar cycle, parametric fits were developed for only these latter modules. However, due to the statistics, a regression fit could only be performed for the TEPC located at Service Module Panel 327 \(SM-327 with the TEPC oriented perpendicular to the velocity vector i.e, perpendicular to the light fixture\ illustrated in Figure 6 Parametric Model Development \226 Figure 7 illustrates the fit for all crossings over the SAA to the mean daily atmospheric density. For this regression, raw data lying outside the 95% prediction interval was excluded. Equation 4\ives the parametric fit where TR TEPC H is the mean TEPC dose equivalent rate due to trapped radiation exposure, in units of \265Sv min 1 and is the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the SAA in g cm 3 The density range of the parametric model goes from 1.26\32710 15 to 7.67 \32710 15 g cm 3  and the mean time spent within the SAA on a daily basis is determined to be 73 \261 17 min. This mean time is multiplied through the curve to give a mean daily dose equivalent rate  003 212\212 327  4  Figure 7. Trapped radiation mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate in units of \265Sv min 1 as a function of mean daily atmospheric density in units of g cm 3 for all passes over the SAA The exponential dependence determined in this work is consistent with that published elsewhere [12,13,14 eepin g in mind that those results are based on data collected aboard the Mir Space Station and interpolated against a different atmospheric density model. In Figure 7 it is noted that an increase in atmospheric density results in a decrease in TEPC dose equivalent rate. This is expected as an increased density results in a greater loss of trapped protons East-West Asymmetry in the SAA \226 The trapped proton flux distribution inside the SAA is not uniform. Those protons which gyrate from below will travel through a thicker atmosphere than those coming from above  Figure 8. Trapped radiation mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate in units of \265Sv min 1 as a function of mean daily atmospheric density in units of g cm 3 for ascending and descending passes over the SAA As was mentioned earlier, an increased atmospheric density has the effect of removing protons from the trapped radiation environment. Hence, an asymmetric proton flux distribution would arise, which is commonly known as the East-West asymmetry effect [30,31 T h is eff ect w i l l s h o w  up as a difference in the measured dose rate during   TR TEPC 5 0.3653 1.3538 10 H 


7   ascending and descending passes through the SAA Ascending passes are defined by an increase in latitude from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere, while descending passes are defined as a decrease in latitude from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere Figure 8 illustrates the regression for the model describing ascending and descending passes individually. The data lying outside the 95% prediction interval were excluded in order to improve the correlation. Equation \(5\d Eq. \(6 detail the parametric fits for descending \(DSC\nd ascending \(ASC\ses, respectively. The descending parametric model is valid for atmospheric densities ranging from 9.45\32710 16 to 9.27 \32710 15 g cm 3 The mean time spent within the SAA for descending passes on a daily basis is determined to be 40 \261 7 min. For ascending passes, the atmospheric density range goes from 1.01\32710 15 to 6.46\32710 15 g cm 3 and the mean time spent in the SAA is 40 \261 7 min  003 212   6 It is seen that the descending pass dose equivalent rates are larger than the ascending pass dose equivalent rates. This has also been observed by Dachev et al  h o obs erv e d  similar effects with the Liulin dosimeter 2.4 \226 Model Implementation The International Space Station Cosmic Radiation Exposure Model \(ISSCREM\as been scripted into MATLAB 2008b as a Windows XP, 32 bit, PC application. The model is structured with a graphical user interface \(GUI\he GUI itself is not a standalone executable and requires MATLAB 2008b to be installed on the computer.

Using a user inputted heliocentric potential value, along with the interpolated cutoff rigidity values, Eq. \(2\used to determine the expected dose equivalent due to GCR exposure. The ISS position vectors are compared against the extent of the SAA and all GCR dose equivalent estimates with state vectors that lie within the SAA region are set to zero. The extent of the SAA has been delineated by the 0.6 265Sv min 1 contour line of the smoothed trapped dose equivalent rate collected during 2008 [1 o r t h os e locations within the SAA, the daily mean atmospheric density is determined and Eq. \(4\ is used to determine the expected mean daily TR dose equivalent 3  M ODEL B ENCHMARKING  In the following sections, ISSCREM is benchmarked against TEPC data collected from 2000, 2002, 2007, 2009 and 2010 [19,20 n or der t o t e s t t h e m odel   3.1 \226 Data Comparison The model can be benchmarked to measured values while the TEPC was placed at SM-327 during the years 2000 2007, 2009, and 2010 [20,21 R e s p ect i v el y   f o r t h e s e y ears   the measured mean yearly heliocentric potentials from the FAA are: 893 MV, 316 MV, 234 MV, and 337 MV For years 2000 and 2009, the measured potentials extend beyond the parametric model limits and therefore, the extremes of the model were used. For 2002, the TEPC was not positioned at SM-327 and therefore the model cannot be benchmarked against these data Table 1 summarizes the predicted and measured values for GCR exposure, while Table 2 to Table 4 summarize the predicted TR dose equivalents for daily passes over the SAA, and for the ascending and descending passes respectively. As shown, the GCR model predictions are within \2615% of measured values. The TR model predictions are within \26120% of measured values though the majority of predictions fall well within this limit. Figure 9 and Figure 10 illustrate representative plots of the daily GCR and TR dose equivalent predictions against measured values for 2007 and 2009 respectively \(with the TEPC located at SM-327\s evidenced, the GCR model is within \26110% of measured values on a daily basis and the TR model is largely within 26120% except for a brief period following the 17 th of July which is due to detector orientation effects \(see Section 3.2 The GCR parametric models were further benchmarked against the entire data sets from 2000, 2002, 2007, 2009 and 2010 as shown in Table 5. This exercise was done in order to test the predictions of the GCR parametric model against changes in TEPC location. Except for year 2000, the predicted GCR doses are again well within \2615% and the predicted time spent within the GCR environment are within 2611% of measured values. On a daily basis, the GCR parametric model can predict measured TEPC values to within \26110% for the vast majority of the time, though a slight dependency of dose on shielding conditions is observed. This dependency, however, is relative to the GCR parametric model which is based on data collected from numerous locations during 2001 and 2008 and not a particular location 003 212\212 327  5   ASC TEPC 0.2119 0.0020 H   DSC TEPC 4 0.3054 1.0665 10 H

9   3.2 \226 Detector Orientation Effects For the majority of the time in Figure 10, the model was able to track the TR exposures to within \26120%. From June 17 to July 8, however, the measured values increased dramatically relative to the model predictions. This steep rise is related to changes in the TEPC detector orientation From February 13 to March 30, the TEPC was positioned at SM-327 in the orientation illustrated in Figure 6 \(note the orientation with respect to light fixture\his is the orientation for which the model was developed.  From June 17 to July 8, the TEPC was re-positioned by the crew aboard the ISS in the orientation shown in Figure 11 \(the detector is now orientated parallel to the light fixtures After this period, on July 9, the crew again repositioned the TEPC returning it to a perpendicular orientation with the light fixtures [20,21  T h is o r ien t atio n ch a n g e res u lted in a  50% increase in the measured daily dose equivalent indicating significant dependence of the TR dose equivalent on localized shielding variations as well as the proton flux asymmetry inside the SAA   Figure 11. TEPC detector orientation at SM-327 from 17 June, 2009 to 8 July, 2009 [2  3.3 \226 Sensitivity Analysis The various solar activity input parameters \(F10.7, AP, U and the SAA extent are varied individually to investigate the effect on the predicted GCR and TR dose equivalent. In the previous benchmarks, measured and tabulated solar activity parameters were used in the model. If, however, the model is to be used for predictions at future times, these input parameters will have to be projected Heliocentric Potential \226  The heliocentric potential U is used to account for GCR solar modulation effects. In this analysis, the known values of U were varied by: \(1 2\0%, \(3\sing the value from the prior year, and \(4 using solar maximum and minimum conditions. Overall, if the heliocentric potential is varied by up to \26120%, the predicted GCR dose will still remain within \26110% of the measured value. If the heliocentric potential from the prior year is chosen, the predicted dose does not exceed more than 5% of the measured value. If extreme limits are chosen instead, the dose predictions remained within 15%. These results suggest that the GCR parametric model is fairly insensitive over the whole solar cycle period and that, as a worst case, the mean heliocentric potential from the prior year would offer a reasonable approximation of the GCR dose equivalent prediction Solar Radio Flux Variation 226 The solar radio flux parameter at 10.7 cm \(F107\d the corresponding 81 day mean flux F81\sed in the determination of atmospheric density Keeping all other parameters constant \(i.e. U, Ap, and SAA extent\he F107 parameter was varied by \26110%, \26120%, and 26150% and the corresponding F81 parameters were recalculated. Generally, an increase in the solar radio flux parameter results in an under-prediction of the trapped dose equivalent while a decrease results in an over-prediction Furthermore, a 50% change in the solar radio flux parameter resulted in variances of up to 50%, compared to measured values, at the most extreme case. Assuming forecasts of the solar radio flux are within \26120%, the accuracy improves to within 25%. Ideally, it is suggested to use the lower limit on the solar radio flux forecasts so as to result in an overprediction of the dose equivalent Ap Magnetic Index \226  The Ap index indicates the level of magnetic disturbance of Earth\222s magnetic field due to the influence of the Sun\222s activity and is also used in the determination of the atmospheric density. In this study, all other parameters \(i.e. F107, U, and SAA extent\were kept constant while the Ap index was varied to values of 0, 25 50, 100, and 400 to represent more progressively disturbed conditions. The cumulative dose predictions were compared against measured values with the TEPC placed at SM-327 for years 2000, 2007, 2009, and 2010. If moderate levels of magnetic activity are assumed \(Ap of 25\ the model will typically under-predict the measured dose by up to 25 Even when assuming higher levels of geomagnetic activity which are typically experienced only during violent solar emission \(Ap of 100\ predictions are within +30%. The Ap index therefore does not overly influence the predicted trapped radiation dose SAA Delineation \226  The extent of the SAA with a 0.6 \265Sv min 1 contour line was chosen because it offered the most reasonable definition of the SAA region t h i s  analysis, the SAA extent is increased to cover larger areas represented by 0 an 0.3 \265Sv min 1 contour lines\As the SAA is known to be expanding, this analysis offers a sense of how accurate the predictions will be in future times. This benchmarking considers data when the TEPC data was positioned at SM-327 for years 2000, 2007, 2009, and 2010 As previously determined, the 0.6 \265Sv min 1 contour line offered the best representation of the SAA as it resulted in a slight over-prediction of the GCR dose in 2000 while the larger areas resulted in under-predictions. That said, all predictions were within 10% of the measured values. As for the TR dose equivalent predictions, no real variation was observed by varying the extent of the SAA suggesting that the mean atmospheric density is not largely influenced by the increased size. Thus, as it is now defined, the current model should be able to handle changing definitions of the SAA as it evolves in size

In particular, the work of Lewis et al 33 showed that the Hawk TEPC used for aircrew exposure monitoring had a small over-response of 15% for photons and neutrons as compared to that which is expected using the ICRU definition of the ambient dose equivalent Unfortunately, the response of the U.S. TEPC used aboard the ISS as compared to the ambient dose equivalent has never been assessed. Furthermore, because the TEPC used aboard the ISS is different from that used in the aircrew dosimetry work, and given that the radiation spectra in space are very different to those at aviation altitudes, the impact of this assumption is not clear. Nevertheless, for this preliminary assessment, the relation of Eq. \(7\med to hold 4.1 \226 Effective dose equivalent Simulations To determine the E  H  10\ ratio, a transport calculation can be performed for the radiation environment in LEO through the ISS shielding and into the habitable volume.

For trapped proton exposures, protons and heavy ions up to aluminum nuclei \(Z = 1 to 13\ere modelled inside the habitable volume while for the GCR exposures the radiation environment modelled included all ions up to nickel nuclei \(Z = 1 to 28\. In addition, for both TR and GCR exposures, neutrons, electrons, and \223exotic particles\224 pions, kaons, muons\ were also studied  Figure 12.

A spectrum of wall thicknesses was chosen because the true shielding geometries are not known. Even though this results in a different total mass of the SM, this variation provided a means to assess the effects of local shielding on the simulated dose rates. The complex geometry tested in this work is illustrated in Figure 16 and is designed to closely mimic the true geometry of the ISS around the SM. It is intended to provide a means to assess the influence that adjacent modules may have on the particle flux environment inside the SM. Using this complex geometry, comparisons were made against simulations of the simple geometry at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2  4.4 \226 Transport Simulations Transport calculations were performed using the threedimensional Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System PHITS\ This is a general purpose Monte Carlo code that has been developed jointly between researchers at the Research Organization for Information Science and Technology \(RIST\ Atomic Energy Agency \(JAEA High Energy Accelerator Research Organization \(KEK Japan, and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden 18,44 PH I T S h a s been des i g n e d w i t h t h e s p eci f i c pu rpose of accurately transporting heavy ions at high energies through complex shielding and geometries.

The source input is isotropically distributed within this source sphere. Outside the cylinder the environment is setup to be a perfect vacuum while inside the cylinder, the environment is composed of air at a density of 0.001292 g cm 3 For the simulations with the complex geometry, the spherical source is increased to 100 m diameter to accommodate the additional size. In all simulations, the minimum energy allowed for protons neutrons, pions, muons, kaons, deuterons, tritons, alpha particles, and heavy ions is set to 1 keV. Below this energy the particles are no longer transported. For electrons positrons, and photons, the minimum energy that PHITS will track is 1 MeV; this is a function of the version of PHITS being used. Furthermore, for these latter three particles, the maximum energies are set at 1000 MeV, 1000 MeV and 100000 MeV, respectively. Neutrons are transported from thermal energies up to 200 GeV. Below 20 MeV, neutrons are transported using the ENDF Evaluated Nuclear Data Library [47,48 o r p rot on s an d n e u t rons up to 3 GeV, the JENDL-HE library was used [50,51 A ll simulations have been performed on the High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory \(HPCVL\per computer cluster located at Queen\222s University in Canada 4.5 \226 Simple Geometry Results Figure 17 illustrates the simulated proton, neutron, and alpha particle flux distributions inside the simple cylinder model of the ISS for incident GCR and TR sources at solar maximum conditions. This is representative of the flux distribution that would be obtained for solar minimum conditions as well   Figure 17. Differenti al flux distribution of protons neutrons, and alpha particles due to GCR \(dashed line and trapped protons \(solid lines\ at solar maximum incident on a simple cylinde r representation of the ISS with varying aluminum wall thicknesses of 5.40 g cm 2 10.8 g cm 2 16.2 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2  As shown in Figure 17, the neutron flux distribution inside the simple ISS model is seen to increase with the shielding thickness. This is observed for both TR- and GCR-induced neutron distributions. The TR-induced proton flux distribution, in contrast, is seen to fall off with increased shielding thickness and similar behavior is also seen for the alpha particle distributions. In contrast, the GCR-induced proton and alpha particle flux distributions are observed to exhibit a different trend. At low energies, below approximately 2000 MeV nuc 1 the GCR-induced proton flux distribution is seen to increase with wall thickness while beyond this energy range, it decreases. The GCR induced alpha distribution behaves similarly, however the transition occurs at approximately 10 MeV nuc 1 rather than at 2000 MeV nuc 1 These observed behaviors are attributed to the variations in incident energies between TR and GCR sources

As the thickest shielding studied in this work is 10 cm, it follows then that the lower energies of the incident trapped proton spectra are most affected Additionally, although the incident trapped proton spectra reach energies of up to approximately 600 MeV, the majority of the spectra are dominated by low energy protons and are thus strongly attenuated by the shielding Essentially, the increased shielding thickness has the effect of hardening the incident proton flux distribution. This result also helps explain the significant localized shielding dependencies observed in the TR model development Comparatively, the GCR spectrum includes heavy ions that reach well above GeV energies. Consequently, GCR ions can undergo spallation and fragmentation with the aluminum shielding resulting in the ejection of large amounts of nucleons and lighter ions. All these secondary particles will have energies lower than the primary incident ions but that are still quite large. In addition to this is the sheer abundance of heavy ions present in the primary and secondary flux distributions. With increasing wall thicknesses, the likelihood of spallation, fragmentation, and other resonance effects increases as well. These processes favor the increase in proton and alpha particle fluxes at low energies with thicker shielding. Above the transition points the various flux distributions decrease with increasing wall thickness suggesting they are populated by a combination of high-energy incident protons and alpha particles that penetrate through the shielding as well as heavy ions that release secondary protons and alpha particles. These fluxes will fall off, however, with the shielding thickness as the likelihood of penetration decreases Overall, when the GCR- and TR-induced distributions are summed together, the neutron component and proton component dominate the flux distribution at low energies At higher energies, the protons represent the dominant contributor to the total dose. Furthermore, at very high energies, alpha particles start to become more dominant than neutrons and their abundance becomes comparable to that of the protons. Table 6 and Table 7 detail the calculated ambient dose equivalent rates, effective dose equivalent rates and E/H  10\ios for trapped protons and GCR ions at solar maximum and minimum conditions, and for the four wall thicknesses As is detailed in Table 6, the simulated TR-induced daily ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates decrease with increasing wall thickness. The simulated values are also smaller at solar maximum conditions relative to solar minimum as expected. Next, it is useful to benchmark the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates against the TEPC dose equivalent measurements collected in 2000 and 2009 to verify the assumption that H TEPC  is approximately H  10\d moreover, to verify that the first order approximation provided by Eq. \(9\ is reasonable. The year 2000 coincides with solar maximum conditions and during this time, the ISS orbited at an altitude of 372 km to 396 km. In contrast, the year 2009 represents solar minimum conditions and the ISS orbited at an altitude of 340 km to 380 km. The measured TEPC daily dose equivalent rates at the location of Service Module Panel 327 SM-327\ged between 0.15 \226 0.2 mSv d 1 in 2000 and 0.2 \226 0.3 mSv d 1 in 2009. Comparatively, for solar maximum conditions, the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates were found to be as low as 0.094 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2  to as high as 0.42 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 hese simulated values are within a factor of two of the measured values Similarly, at solar minimum conditions, the simulated results ranged from 0.14 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 wall thickness\ 0.85 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 wall thickness\hich 


14   are again within the range of measured results, though the thinnest shielding results in a slightly more conservative estimate that is within a factor of 3. It is thus noted that a change in wall thickness does have a significant influence on the TR-induced doses. While it is unclear which of the results best approximates the ISS shielding, it is argued that the upper and lower limits of the shielding thicknesses used provide representative limits of the expected dose The simulated TR-induced effective dose equivalent rate determined by Sato et al 53 a t so l a r  mi ni mu m c o nd i t i o n s   for a wall thickness of 5.56 cm \(15 g cm 2 uminum, was estimated to be 0.144 mSv d 1 In that study, fluence-toeffective dose equivalent conversion factors for all heavy ions were used. To compare, at 10.8 g cm 2 in our study the simulated effective dose equivalent was determined to be 0.187 mSv d 1 For a wall thickness of 16.2 g cm 2 the effective dose equivalent rate was determined to be 0.127 mSv d 1 These simulated values are in good agreement with the values presented by Sato et al  d i n di cat e s t h at  the majority of the effective dose equivalent due to TR exposure is reasonably estimated considering only the neutron, proton, and alpha particle contributions. The simulated ratios of E  H  10\uctuate from 0.41 up to 0.51 for solar maximum conditions and 0.35 to 0.48 for solar minimum conditions. This ratio also appears to fall off with decreasing wall thickness. Overall, the latter results suggest that for TR exposures, the TEPC measured ambient dose equivalent offers a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent Unlike the daily TR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates, the predicted GCR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates increase with increasing wall thickness Table 7\This results due to the increased neutron, proton and alpha particle flux distributions at low energies. As expected, the daily ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose equivalent rates are again smaller at solar maximum conditions as compared to solar minimum conditions. The measured GCR dose equivalent values in 2000 and 2009 are on the order of 300 to 400 \265Sv d 1 and 400 to 500 \265Sv d 1 respectively. In comparison, the simulated values range from 60 \265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 8 265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar maximum conditions and 100 265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 o 206 \265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar minimum conditions. These predicted values underestimate the measured ones by more than a factor of two. This can be attributed to the exclusion of the heavy-ion contributions Moreover, these results also suggest that as an operational quantity, the ambient dose equivalent is not well suited for high-energy heavy ions. This observation has also been previously suggested by Pelliccioni h o i n di cat ed t h a t  a depth greater than 10 mm would be more appropriate for higher-energy radiation and that no single depth is appropriate for all heavy ions Sato et al  o calcu late d th e eff ect iv e dos e equiv ale nt rate from GCR exposures \(including heavy ions\for a wall thickness of 15.0 g cm 2 Al to be 0.21 mSv d 1 At solar minimum conditions, the simulated effective dose equivalent rates in this study are found to be 0.13 mSv d 1  and 0.15 mSv d 1 for wall thicknesses of 10.8 g cm 2 and 16.2 g cm 2 respectively. As was the case earlier, there is again a slight discrepancy regards to those published by Sato et al 53 attrib u t ed to th e ex clu s io n o f th e h e a v y io n s   It was shown by Sato [53 th at th e co n t rib u tio n to t h e cumulative effective dose equivalent from both iron nuclei and pions are each nearly as much as the contribution alpha particles. Despite these underestimations, from the current simulations the ratios of effective-to-ambient dose equivalent are relatively constant between solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Furthermore, unlike TR exposures, the ratios decrease from 1.19 to 0.84 with increasing shielding thickness. These results suggest that the ambient dose equivalent is roughly a 1:1 estimate of the effective dose equivalent for GCR exposures, depending on which wall thickness is assumed. However, it is again noted that the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates are underestimated so these ratios should fall below one These latter conclusions can also be verified in another manner. The total effective dose equivalent estimated by Sato et al 53 in sid e th e ISS at so lar m i n i m u m co n d itio n s   was determined to be 0.37 mSv d 1 The total dose equivalent from TR and GCR exposures measured with the TEPC at SM-327 during solar minimum conditions \(2009 is approximately 0.6 \226 0.8 mSv d 1 The ratio of the effective dose equivalent predicted by Sato to these measured TEPC values results in an effective-to-TEPC dose equivalent conversion factor of E  H TEPC of 0.5 to 0.6. This again shows that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent and can be used as an appropriate surrogate protection quantity. This conclusion is applicable to solar maximum conditions as it was shown in the simulation results that for TR exposures the E  H  10\ios are only slightly higher at solar maximum conditions and essentially remain unchanged for GCR exposures from solar maximum to solar minimum 4.6 \226 Complex Geometry Results The above transport simulations at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2 were repeated using the complex geometry shown in Figure 16. Rather than determining the flux inside the entire SM, the flux distribution within the crew quarter \(SM-CQ was examined only. This area best approximates the location of SM-327. When compared to the simple cylinder simulations, the complex geometry is shown to have no effect on the simulated E  H  10\version ratios but does influence the observed ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates. The simulated values for trapped exposures are largely unchanged while for GCR exposures, the complex geometry results in a factor of two increase due to the build-up effect. Specifically, at a wall thickness of 5.4 g cm 2 the simulated ambient and effective 


15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
