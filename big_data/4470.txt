Lilin FAN  College of Computer & Information technology  Henan Normal University Xinxiang , China,453007 e-mail:swjtufll@163.com  Abstract: There are varieties of linkages among the properties of the data in a large database  These linkages are hidden in the data of the database, the purpose of association mining is to identify these hidden association rules. The discovery of association rules is based on frequent itemsets, so how could we make frequent itemsets fast and accurate is the 
main research of association data mining. In this paper, a matrix-based frequent discovery algorithm is raised according to the problems in the existing al gorithms in finding frequent itemsets, and it has a practical application in the automobile fault parts association analysis system of automotive industry chain business intelligence platform Key words: frequent itemsets, association rules, data mining   I NTRODUCTION  The quality of automobile is the base of the a automotive manufacturers\222 survival, there are many ways to improve the 
quality of products, but it is mainly by improving the quality of parts and vehicle design to achieve the objectives of demand of improving product quality for enterprises. One of the major premises is built on a scientific model fault analysis. Models\222 fault analysis is mainly performed by seeking the relationship between the fault and the information of vehicle mileage, the use of time, the territory of use, accessories brands and related fault accessories when some accessories error occurred The basic concepts and classical algorithm algorithm-Apriori of Association Rules Mining were 
proposed by R.Agrawal [1 a l g o r ith m A p ri o r i is c o m p ris e d  of looking for frequent itemsets and the discovery of association rules in two parts, the algorithm is simple intuitive, easy to implement, but there are still two serious problems in its frequent itemsets search[2  A g r eat  de al  of  I/O load is needed when scanning the database several times; It may produce a large candidate itemsets, it\222s a challenge to time and living space In this paper, Frequent Itemsets Mining Algorithms Based on Frequent Matrix is raised for the two problems 
This algorithm avoid the frequent scanning the databases minimize the number of candidate itemsets and improve the efficiency of Association Rules Mining   F REQUENT I TEMSETS M INING A LGORITHMS B ASED ON F REQUENT M ATRIX  Frequent discovery algorithm based on binomial itemsets matrix raised in this paper is a kind of algorithm that discovers all the most likely Frequent itemsets and then 
verify whether they are frequent or not one by one in the constraints of special matrix A  The definition of frequent itemsets   Assume I = {i1 i2 205 , im} is a collection of all the items. D is a collection of database transactions, transaction T is a subset of a project. Each transaction has a unique identifier TID. Assume A is a collection consisting of project, called itemset, transaction T contains A. If the project collection A contains k items, then called k-item 
recorded as Length\(A\=k, times that project A appears in transaction database D is called Itemset Support. If the Support is more than the minimum support threshold given by user, we call the itemset is a frequent itemset     B  Definition and nature of binomial itemsets matrix Definition 1: Set the total number of items in database to p, serious number of items followed by 1, 2, \205, p, matrix Ap\327p\222s element a[i,j  S uppo rt  1 i p, 1 j p \(a[i,i re ga rde d  
as a special binomial itemset\, we regard A as binomial itemsets phalanx of D, It is obviously that the matrix is symmetric on the main diagonal Definition 2: Assume X is an itemset of database Length\(X\=k \(k 3\,  Bk\327k is a phalanx generated by Definition 1, matrix B\222s element b[i,j  S uppo rt  i  j  i s  arbitrary item number in X, then we call B the 978-1-4244-4507-3/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE 


Corresponding binomial itemsets phalanx of itemset X and a subset of A matrix Definition 3: Assume B is a phalanx defined by 2, if arbitrary b[i Minsupport, we call B frequent binomial itemsets phalanx of X Theorem 1  Assume X is a database itemset and Length\(x\=k\(k 3\, then the necessary condition for X of being frequent itemset is: all of its binomial subsets are frequent Proof: According to reference     X if Y X   if Y is a frequent itemset, then X is also a frequent itemset therefore, if a k-itemset is frequent, its all nonempty sets are frequent, it is obviously that all binomial itemsets are frequent.Proof is completed Theorem 2  Assume X is a frequent itemset in D, and Length\(X\=k\(k 3\, items of X are numbers defined by 4 then rule out the rows and columns of items in matrix A that do not belong to X, according to Definition 3: Sub-matrix B that consisted by the rest binomial itemsets will surely be a frequent binomial itemsets phalanx Proof: According to Definition 2, this matrix is corresponding binomial itemsets matrix of X, we can see from the conditions that X is frequent, according to theorem 1, we can see all binomial subsets of X are frequent, with the Definition 6 we know that B is frequent binomial itemset phalanx Therefore, the proposition is established and the proof is completed For binomial set matrix is symmetrical to the main diagonal of matrix, we all use upper triangular matrix to improve budget speed, reduce storage space in practical applications Theorem 3  Assume X is an itemset in D, and Length\(X\=k\(k 3\, then the necessary condition for X is a frequent set is: binomial phalanx of itemset X is frequent phalanx Proof of this theorem is a direct consequence from theorem 1 and will not be repeated The significance of theorem 2 and theorem 3 is that we can get the binomial matrix of the database by scanning it once first, then search this matrix to get the number of frequent phalanx n which is number of maximum candidates of k\(k 3\ frequent itemsets; All itemsets collections corresponding to frequent phalanx is frequent candidate collections of D\(excluding 1,2-frequency set\, as the phalanxí generation is based on frequent binomial itemsets in essence, itís a kind of ìpruningî to the candidates based on frequent matrix, so the number of candidate sets is reduced greatly. The maximum crest reduction of unnecessary itemsets mining improved the mining efficiency C   frequent candidate itemsets generation algorithm For p◊p matrix A defined in definition 1, we use breadth-first search algorithm to find out all possible full-frequency sub matrix, and store them with tree-structure\(item candidate tree Step 1, Search main diagonal elements, if a[i Minsupport, then we create a child node i under the super-root node, corresponding to the special frequent itemset a[i  Step 2, Search elements a[i,j j p\n the right side of matrix a[i  i f a i,j  Minsupport, then we create a child node j under node i\(a[i,j  co rr e s po n d i ng t o fr eq ue nt i t e m se t a i  j    Step 3, Create grandchildren node for all child node of i in accordance with step 2, and so on, until we get the only child node Through this search, we finally get a tree, itís obviously that matrix that consisted by items of the treeís each path might be a frequent binomial itemset matrix. The longest path of the tree is the maximum frequent itemset that may exist Preorder traversal the tree, we find out all paths, all items of each path\(except the root node\ can form a binomial phalanx for each node is a frequent two sets, for example we traverse to the third layer to get a 3◊3 binomial matrix, to the third layer   we get a 4◊4 binomial matrix, the k-th layer might get a k◊k binomial matrix, Then, determine which of the phalanx is frequent according to Definition 3 itemsets corresponding to each frequent phalanx is the frequent candidate itemsets we are looking for, then we put the itemsets into a database of candidate frequent itemsets 


For 1,2-item frequent itemsets can be easily found from binomial itemsets matrix, and 1,2-item frequent itemsets are generally large, so that in order to enhance the research speed, we donít generate 1,2-item by tree, and 2-item frequent sets will not be stored in the database of frequent candidate itemsets neither D   frequent candidate itemsets support algorithm After the frequent candidate itemsets database has been gotten by 2.3, these itemsets need to scan transaction database for a second time, then we calculate the support degree, it can be  true frequent itemsets if it is no less than Misupport, we calculate support degree of candidate itemsets fast through vector inner product calculation  Definition 4 Assume total item number in transaction database D is p, serial numbers of items followed by 1,2 p, then the number of item of frequent candidate itemsets database will not exceed p, transaction bit vector Tran_Vec is defined as follows  Support algorithm is calculated as follows Assume Ficd is frequent candidate itemset database, the number of records\(the number of candidate itemsets\ is Fic_count Step 1, Deine a Fic_count◊p matrix Ficm, each row of the matrix is p-dimensional bit vector that generated according to Definition 4, corresponding to a candidate itemset of database; Define a Fic_count◊1 matrix for the storage of each candidate itemset support in Ficd, set the initial value of each row of the matrix to 0; Define a Fic_count◊1 matrix inner_product_Result_Matrax to store the results of temporary calculation Step 2, Get the first record from the transaction database transfer it to p-dimensional vector Trant_Vecr in accordance with the definition 4 Step3,Inner_product_Result_Matrax=Ficm∑Tran_VecT Step4,Itemsets_Support_Matrax Itemsets_Support_Matrax+ Inner_product_Result_Matrax Step 5, return to Step 2 until all transactions of records are processed Algorithm takes a second scan on transaction database calculate all candidate itemsets support in Ficd dand store them into matrix Itemsets_Support_Matrax, in this matrix candidate itemsets corresponding to the elements whose values are bigger than Minsupport is the final frequent itemsets that we are looking for E  Association rules discovery algorithm  This paper raised a new frequent itemsets discovery algorithm and didnít design special association rules discovery algorithm, in the following applications in this paper, association rules discovery algorithm uses the association rules discovery algorithm according to literature 1 directly, and not repeat any more   A LGORITHM FOR SPECIFIC APPLICATION OF THE RESULTS  The quality of automobile is the base of the a automotive manufacturersí survival, a lot of decisions of enterprises are made around how to improve product quality, the quality of spare parts is good or bad and the design of product is good or bad are the main factors which affecting the quality of automobiles, how to make decisions has become a major problem.

Moreover we can say that F C is comparable to E C and the modi\002ed version of E C i.e vE C  is correct and effective  The combinations of F C  E C  and vE C with 006 conf improve slightly F C  E C  vE C  and 006 conf  We can say that the sum of con\002dences is an important measure and these combined measures are useful in particular in the context where the accuracies of the classi\002cation by the sum of con\002dence by F C  and by E C are almost very good For conclusions 002rstly the adapted weight of evidence is a good class membership measure built on the gain of information F C  a measure built on the revisited 037 2 test provides another view of information gain It is comparable to the adapted weight of evidence The sum of con\002dence is a simple and natural measure with the good performance The combinations of the sum of con\002dence with the previous measures are interesting and useful to improve their performance Next based on the average accuracy values of different measures we recommend to use the combined measures because the average accuracy values of the combined measures are in general better than that of the non-combined measures Finally through the results on each dataset between the combined measures based on 037 2 and the weight of evidence we suggest the following propositions 017 For the 13 small datasets though the average accuracy value of cE C is slightly better than that of cF C  we can observe that cF C is much often wins cE C  Indeed cE C wins cF C on only 3 datasets while cF C wins cE C on 6 datasets Hence we can recommend cF C for the small datasets 017 For the 10 large datasets the average accuracy value of cvE C is slightly better than that of cF C  and cvE C wins cF C on 4 datasets and cF C wins cvE C 3 datasets Hence we can recommend cvE C for large datasets References  B Lent A Sw ami and J W idom Clustering association rules Proc Intl Conf on Data Engineering ICDE'97 IEEE Computer Society 1997 pp 220-231  W  Li J Han and J Pei CMAR Accurate and Ef 002cient Classi\002cation based on multiple class-association rules Proc IEEE Intl Conf on Data Mining ICDM'01 San Jose CA IEEE Computer Society 2001 pp 369-376  B Liu W  Hsu and Y  Ma Inte grating Classi\002cation and Association Rule Mining Proc 4th Intl Conf on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD'98 AAAI Press 1998 pp 80-86  Y  Sun Y  W ang and A.K.C W ong Boosting an Association Classi\002er in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 18 no 7 IEEE Computer Society 2006 pp 988-992  J W ang and G Karypis HARMONY  Ef 002ciently Mining the Best Rules for Classi\002cation Proc SIAM Intl Conf on Data Mining SDM'05 2005 pp 205-216  J W ang and G Karypis On Mining Instance-Centric Classi\002cation Rules in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 18 no 11 2006 pp 1497-1511  Y  W ang and A.K.C W ong From Association to Classi\002cation Inference using Weight of Evidence in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 15 no 3 2003 pp 764-767  F  Coenen The LUCS-KDD Implementations of the FOIL PRM and CPAR algorithms http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk frans/KDD/Software/FOIL PRM CPAR/foilPrmCpar.html Computer Science Department University of Liverpool UK 2004  Y  Basti de R T aouil N P asquier  G Stumme and L Lakhal Mining Frequent Patterns with Counting Inferences in ACM SIGMOD Explorations vol 2 no 2 2000 pp 66-75  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules Proc 20th Intl Conf on Very Large Databases VLDB'94 Santiago Chile 1994 pp 487-499  V  Phan-Luong and R Messouci Building Classi\002ers with Association Rules based on Small Key Itemsets Proc 2nd IEEE International Conf on Digital Information Management ICDIM'07 France 2007 pp 200-205  J Quinlan and R Cameron-Jones FOIL A Midterm Report Proc European Conf on Machine Learning ECML'93 1993 pp 3-20  X Y in and J Han CP AR Classi\002cation based on Predicti v e Association Rules Proc 3rd SIAM Intl Conf on Data Mining SDM'03 San Francisco CA SIAM 2003 pp 369-376  C Cortes and V  V apnik Support-V ector Netw orks  in Machine Learning vol 20 no 3 1995 pp 273-297

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
