Discovering Temporal Similarity Pattern Based on Metamorphosis Data   Yuan Tian Computer and Communi cations Department Hunan Institute of Engineering Xiangtan, 411101, China tianyuan9000@126.com   Abstract  This paper discusses a metamorphosis method for temporal data mining We propose definition of temporal type and time granularity to divide into segments for time, then bu ild an event temporal space which may describe something change of data over time. We give the conception of metamorphosis data in event temporal types space so that it is easier to discover valuable knowledge, but it is  not clear to do it if original data are not metamorphosis. By metamorphosis data, we study a problem of knowledge discovery of temporal similarity pattern based on the temporal type is given  A method based on selforganizing map \(SOM\ to find similarity pattern is proposed  1. Introduction  The temporal data mining has a wide spectrum for knowledge discovery, such as periodic patterns of stock movement, a temporal association rule of the two products, frequent sequences of  car manufacturing to signal jam detection. John and Myra introduced a framework for reviewing research related to temporal mining and have reviewed research contributions related to various aspects of the temporal data mining and knowledge discovery in detail T h e t e m poral  data in the many fields is so complex that it is very difficult to mine useful knowledge. A feasible method is often used to reconstruct phase spaces, which can solve the prediction of complicated time series events  Large amounts of time series data is produced routinely in a number of application areas, such as finance, economy, process industry, experimental sciences, medicine, and monitoring of electrical distribution network disturbances. The analysis of such data is an important task to discover pertinent knowledge in data and hence time series data mining assumes significance and usefulness. There are many researches of similarity patterns in the field of molecular mechanisms \(biology g u a ge  acquisition \(linguistics\4 cer d i ag n o sis  medicine B u t, p a p e rs o f  si m ilarit y p a ttern s o f  temporal data mining are few.

Similarity pattern mining  should be an active research in the fields of data mining. It has wide applications, such as stock consumption, weather, e-business and so on. In this paper, we define temporal data space as reconstructing phase spaces by metamorphosis data. In the metamorphosis temporal data space, we can discovery similarity pattern for complex time event to extend full or partial periodicity patterns  2.

the validity of the temporal association rules, cycle length and similarity sequence patterns Time in the real world is deemed to be limitless without beginning and ending. Time can be regarded as a real number axis, each point of which represents some moment, just like that described in physics. The interval from one point to another point can be viewed as some time. As a result, we call the moment in real world as absolute time tick \(ATT\, all of which constitute a real number set R or time axis\n order to decide the real numbers which represent moment we choose January 1, A.D.1 00:00:00 as the origin of the axis R and precision of every point on R is second or more precise unit. The interval from one point to another is called absolute time interval \(ATI\which is a set of ATTs. For example, February 2, 2000 02:03:50 is an ATT and an ATI can be from February 2, 2000 00:00:00 to February 2,2000 24:00:00 Now, we give a definition of temporal type as follows Definition 2.1 Let  be a mapping from a t to an ATI  t  i.e 2 R R 002  R t 003   2 R t  003 003  tt  002 If all of the following \(1\\(4\are satisfied, then  is called a temporal type and   t  is called the temporal factor of the temporal type   Non-empty  t  004\005 for   t t  003  Monotonous\ For 2 1 t t  and 12    tt  006=\005 003 then arbitrary 1  tt  003  and arbitrary 2  tt  003   tt   holds, which is denoted by     2 1 t t     Identical  tt  003    tt     Limitary  For each  tt  003  007   t  The definition of temporal type in this paper is in several respects more general than the time models used in other papers. Obviously temporal type is clustering to time axis R and each temporal factor is an interval. Second, minute, hour, day, week, month and year which satisfy the above properties  can be used to classify time axis R and thus they are temporal type If   t   R t 003 nly one point \(i.e. time tick\, then   is called atomic temporal type otherwise  is called non-atomic  temporal type The temporal type usually used in our daily life is Non-atomic. The following properties are obtained accord ing to the Definition2.1 Property 2.1 If 2 1 t t 004 then      2 1 005  006 t t    or    2 1 t t     Property 2.2 Let  be a non-atomic temporal type and n an integer   TT is a given absolute time interval. Then there exist n real numbers 12   n tt t 000  with 12 n tt t   000 which satisfy       1 000 n i i t T T  010   therein whenever 1,2 ij n 003 with j i 004  005  006     j t i t    Property 2.3 For any R t 003 sup  t  and inf   t  then inf   t  011 011 i t sup  t   for all  i tt  003  Then, we present the length of temporal factor  t   with the formula   t  sup   inf   tt   Clearly the actual measure of time axis depends on the time unit used in application under consideration. A year may be partitioned into 12 months, and also into 365 days. Which partition is more applicable? For example in a geological database on sediments, days will be too fine as a time unit. So day is used to partition the time interval there Basic temporal type helps to solve the aforementioned problem. Then, we give the definition and properties about basic temporal type  Definition 2.2 Let 012    be two temporal type s. If       t t  012  holds for any tR 003 which is called temporal type  012 less than temporal type  For any temporal factor    t 012 of 012 if there is only one temporal  factor of  noted as    t  such that      t t  012 010 then 012 is called a basic temporal type  of   Obviously second is the basic temporal type of minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter and year. That is, each second falls entirely within one minute, one hour, one day and so on. Likewise hour is the basic 
60 


temporal type of day, week, month, quarter and year The rest may be deduced by analogy. Whereas week is not the basic temporal type of month due to the overlap of temporal factors i.e. a month can start in the middle of a week. For example, the fifth week of January 2003, i.e. from January 26, 2003 to February 1, 2003 falls in January   and February Property 2.4 Let the temporal types 012 be a basic temporal type of  Then for any   t   of  there exist n real numbers 12   n tt t with 12 n tt t   000  such that     1 000 n i i t t   012  where 005  006     j t i t     1 2  ij n 003 with j i 004  000   n i i t v t 1      holds Definition 2.3 Let  be a non-atomic temporal type  and 012 a basic temporal type of  And     1 000 n i i t t   012  therein 12 n tt t   000 and whenever  1 2  ij n 003  with j i 004  005  006     j t i t   So the relative length of  t  to v is n which is denoted by Re    llen t n 012    Definition 2.4 Let   be a non-atomic  temporal type and 012 a basic temporal type of  Then we have the following definitions 1  If the lengths of all temporal factor s of  are equal  is called a time granularity  2  If 012 is a time granularity then 012 is called a basic time granularity of   3  If all temporal factor s  i t  of  can be classified as finite classes in accordance with the length of  i t    is called a coarse time granularity  4  If 012 is a coarse time granularity  012 is called a basic coarse time granularity of   Any time granularity is coarse time granularity  We can conclude the following corollary according to the property 2.2 Corollary 2.1 Any given time interval can be covered by finite time factor s of any coarse time granularity  So, the temporal types often used in our daily life such as second, minute, hour, day and week are time granularities, while the temporal types such as month quarter and year are only coarse time granularities because the lengths of all their temporal factors are different. Obviously second, minute, hour and day are the basic time granularities of month, quarter and year Basic time granularity is often used to measure other time granularities or coarse time granularities. For example, in stock statistic second and day are often used as basic granularities to describe the trend of stock fluctuation. Also we can use coarse time granularity to measure other time granularities or coarse time granularities. Month has four different lengths, i.e. 28 days, 29 days, 30 days and 31 days. A quarter which has four different lengths has three months. A year which has two different lengths has twelve months or four quarters  3. Discovering Temporal Similarity Pattern in Event Temporal Types Space  Let  A be a set of objectives, denoted by      2 1 m A A A A 000  where each i A   i 1,2 m s the same attributes 12    q SSS S  000 and each attribute i S   i 1,2 q cludes many values e The value e may be finite or infinite number \(or symbol\A value i e  i 1,2 q of attribute i S  is called a state of i S All values i e of state are denoted by a set E i  Let       2 1 q e e e e 000   q E E E E     000 2 1 then   i Ae 000\004 called an event. Then A  E  event types space of objective A which consists of all event types  i Ae 000\004 et 012 be a temporal type, then       t v e A i is called a temporal event for objective i A at temporal factor   t 012  A  E  012 alled event temporal types space  For example, some stock  can be defined as objects sets. Each stock has some attributes such as  opening price  closing price, selling deal and so on. Each price has real number       t v e A i Stock A

10.00,10.12,45000\,20/08/2006\eans that Stock A has  as  opening price 10.00  closing price 10.12 selling deal 45000 on August,20,2006  In fact, a temporal event may be a record in database. We can discover some knowledge by mining these temporal data. But,  there are too many anomalistic data in temporal database so that it is very difficult to discover  valuable knowledge, such as the price of stock. We need change value of attribute into other value so that we can easily find out some valuable knowledge, such as temporal associate rule approximate period.  We give definition the metamorphosis of data Definition 3.1 Let A  E  012 and A  E    event temporal types space, where  is a basic temporal type of 012 Let a map i 013  ii E 014 002  where i 014 is also state value of  each attribute i S All values of state i 014 is denoted by a set E i            2 1 q E E E E 000  Then      2 1 q 013 013 013 013 000  is called a metamorphosis of data from E to E for   012 en v         2 1 q 013 013 013 013 000  is called a metamorphosis of data from E to E  Let A  A 1  A 2    A m be a set of finite attributes Suppose that v is a temporal type, an event that an attribute A i happens in state e at the temporal factor v  t represented as A i  e  v  t  Let a set 11 2 2                    ii i iJJ Aev Aevt Ae vt Ae vt  000G\000G 000  12 J tt t   000 otes an event sequence for state j e  to  attribute A i at v  t j  j 1,2 J All event sequence set is denoted by   ev 000G\000G A   Definition 3.2  Let any two   ii Aev Aev 000J\000G 000J\000G 000J\000G 000J\000G    ev 003 000G\000G A  Let a metamorphosis map 0,1 E 013 002  For given number 015 let 12       x eee 013\013      J e 013 and 12          J x eee e 013\013 013     xe xe 015 011 Then   i Aev 000G\000G is called temporal similarity to   i Aev 000G 000G for 015 Let a set TS J    i Aev 000G 000G  temporal similarity pattern to   i Aev 000G\000G for 015 where each   i Aev 000G 000G in TS J    i Aev 000G 000G mporal similarity to   i Aev 000G 000G for 015 when number of  element in TS J     i Aev 000G 000G s enough big When 12 J ee e  000  each   i Aev 000G 000G in TS J    i Aev 000G 000G a repeated sequence to occur. Each event sequence in TS    i Aev 000G 000G eans similarity law of continuous state under different temporal factors if there is not any temporal factor between  j vt and 1  j vt  for all j 1,2 J 1. If there are all same number of temporal factors between  j vt and 1  j vt   for all j 1,2 J 1 TS J    i Aev 000G\000G a similarly period pattern. On the other hand, let p jj 1  be  number of temporal factors between  j vt and 1  j vt  If p 12  p 23 p J-1J then TS    i Aev 000G 000G a similarity period pattern when all state are same in TS J    i Aev 000G\000G  We propose a method based on self-organizing map \(SOM\ find similarity pattern in   ev 000G 000G A The SOM consists of disciplinarian neuron of two dimensional matrix m 003j m which a weight vector from a input vector X i   x e neuron or connected unit j in output layer is defined as a vector w ij where the dimension value of X i  is equal to that of w ij The number of neuron from ten to thousand decides efficiency and validity of the SOM. The  training algorithm of SOM is as follows   Step 1. Give a training set   ev 000G\000G A and 015  a metamorphosis map 0,1 E 013 002 then we obtain set   x e  a\ each step of the iterative training, choose an event sequence X i   x e 003   as input vector and compute distances from vector X i  to all units of SOM so that  the winner unit, denoted by w i b is obtained

Conclusions  This paper proposes definition of temporal type and time granularity to divide into segments for time. We build an event temporal space which may describe something change of data at temporal type, such as similarity pattern. We give the conception of metamorphosis data in event temporal types space so that it is easier to discover valuable knowledge. And we present the similarity pattern on the basis of temporal type. And lastly, we discuss a clustering algorithm based on self-organizing map to detect temporal similarity pattern. The algorithm of this paper has discovered some similarity patterns in the web data. It is very significant in the practical  application in the web page couldn’t be commonly found. A future work direction will be to extend the work that looks for other pattern on multi-attribute and multiple time granularities. Another interesting extension of our work will be the development of the algorithm to raise its efficiency  5. References  1  John F.

We have shown significant accuracy in the  output of the proposed algorithm. Although we have used level-wise search for finding irregular patter ns each step of our algorithm is different from any ot her level-wise search algorithm Rules generation from desired item sets is also different from conventiona l association mining algorithms 8.

The selected Operating System in Windows or Linux-like are also reasonable since both are the most popular desktop-based Operating System.  The need for reviews and thumbs by other users seems to have good influence for another users to download and try the OSS The file size in MB magnitude appears with possible explanation that users are more interested in larger scale OSS Project than medium or small one.  Lastly, the English or European language translation is important since many of OSS Projects are originated from this region \(Englishspeaking countries or other European language-speaking countries\.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
