Exploring the effects of text clustering on on-line military news based on quantitative association rule  Liang-Chu Chen 1 Chyi-Bao Yang 2 Jih-Hsin Chen 3 Yen-Hsuan Lien 1  nctuhorse@gmail.com cbyang@ccit.edu.tw satament@gmail.com misaki5168@gmail.com 1 Department of Information Management, Management College, National Defense University, Taiwan 2 Department of Computer Science, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taiwan 3 Northern area Reserve Headquarters, Ministry of Reserve Command, Taiwan   Abstract Text clustering is an automatic technique to group texts using the approach of feature extraction and term connection to calculate the similarities among subject contents of texts. Since the properties of terms in Chinese text \(e.g. segmentation and annotation are not as clear as the other languages, extracting and distinguishing features from Chinese text is therefore much more difficult, which greatly impacts the effects of clustering From the perspective of military news, this paper applies both quantitative association rule and hierarchical agglomerative algorithm to cluster Chinese news published in Youth Daily News, and the application results are compared with those by the traditional vector space model approach and by the general association rule approach, respectively. F-measure is used as evaluation metric in the experiments. Experimental results show that the quantitative association rule approach performs more accurately than both the vector space model and association rule in text automatic clustering Keywords Vector space model; Association rule Quantitative association rule; Hierarchical agglomerative clustering   1. Introduction Data mining is generally used to mine information from a structured data, such as a transaction database rather than from an unstructured data, such as a document, webpage, and so on. The emerging field of text mining uses method from data mining to extract interesting information and knowledge. In general the process of text mining includes: domain selection text preprocessing, mining analysis, and result visualization. Domain selection is the step to collect and arrange plenty of text data in a specific subject domain. In the step of text preprocessing, terms in a document are divided or combined based on the relevant rules, and the key-terms being able to represent the characteristic of text is selected. By the rules of appearance frequency, co-occurrence, or cluster, mining analysis is performed to construct the relationship among word structures. In the result visualization step, the correlated results are exhibited through graphic tools  Traditional text clustering often adopts the vector space model \(VSM\ to express text data. By this approach, Lee et al. showed that there are two drawbacks in clustering results i rs t l y  si n ce t h e  relationships between terms in text can not be identified, the clustering of text is misjudged Secondly, high dimension of terms will easily induce the problem of inaccurate clustering. Therefore, Lee et al pos ed a t w o-s t a g e docum en t cl u s t e ri ng  method based on association rule mining to investigate the text cluster problem for the document in English  However, traditional association rule \(AR approach practically only considers if a term appears in the document, but the occurrence quantity of term is ignored, which can not reflect the actual connection between terms. Fabrizio et al. [6 u ed  if the quantity is took into account during the AR mining process, more hidden connections among rules and more multiple relationships among items may be discovered to be applied on other different practices. Since the factor of quantity is not currently considered in the application of association rules on text mining, this paper adopts the qualitative association rule \(QAR\, which adds the occurrence frequency of term in every document into the items to mine rules, to increase the connections among words, to reduce the noises resulting from misjudgment, and to enhance the quality of clustering for documents in Chinese 000\003 2.

presents news events but also provides some functions of news categorization and recommendation to satisfy the usersí requirements on querying information from news. For instance, in Google News, news events can be automatically classified, and users can select their own country languages as well as recommend some specific news in Yahoo News, except for the functions of news classification, the functions of photo news and popular recommendation are also included Chen et al. [3 l e c t e d G oogl e N e w s a s sa m p l e  sources to propose an automatic method for constructing news knowledge ontology, and this method then was applied on automatic query expansion of news search engine to resolve the issues of uneasily selecting a good query term for users. For the news on both CNN and Reuterís websites Perelomov et al pos e d a s e l f o rg a n i z i n g m a p  SOM\ed approach to construct a news subject map. By selecting on-line news as sources, Ong et al  ppl i e d n a t u ral l a nguag e proces s i ng N L P   technique to automatically extract terms in the news and constructed a hierarchical news map  However, the literatures above investigated the on-line news in general scopes, but the news in a specific domain, particularly in military domain, had not been explored 000\003 2.2  Quantitative Association Rules Data mining is attempted to discover the useful hidden information from plenty of data. The main techniques in data mining involve classification cluster, sequential patterns, AR, and decision tree, etc Han th at th e techn i qu e being  m o s t of te n  used is the association rule, which uses both support and confidence parameters to find out the connections among item sets. Traditional AR is based on the Apriori algorithm to analyze the item sets in transaction database. Recently, many Apriori algorithm based association rules have been proposed 4, 7  However, traditional association rules merely consider if the item appears in transaction database but the quantity of item bought is neglected. In practice, both the item and its quantity are recorded in transaction QAR  m i n i ng th e di ff eren t  corresponding membership methods are adopted to partition the intervals for the item with different quantity in order to mine more and more potential useful association rules. The quantitative partition algorithm is shown in Fig. 1 2.3  Cluster analysis Clustering means the automatic assignment of a set of data into some subsets in which the data with higher similarity in some senses are automatically grouped. The objective of cluster analysis is to discover the clustering results and infer some useful hidden, and interested features and phenomenon through analyzing the similarity degree among data Hierarchical clustering utilizes the agglomerative or divisive method to merge those smaller clusters with higher degree of similarity among them into the larger clusters, or according to the requirements of users, to split the larger clusters to generate different number of clusters. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering \(HAC\orithm is a bottom up approach to merge all the data points  In the HAC algorithm, there are four methods to define the distance between clusters: single-linkage complete-linkage, average-linkage \(AL\, and Wardís method. Chuang and Ch ealed th at th e  clustering results of average-linkage are the best among four methods. Thus, this paper adopts the AL method to calculate the distance between documents   Step1: Let {<i,q 1 i,q 2 i,q 3  014 i,q n be the set of q_items in DB which have the same item i. And q 1  q 2 q 3 014 q n  Step2: Assume that c 1 c 2 c 3 014 and c n are the numbers of transactions containing <i,q 1 i,q 2 i,q 3  014 and 000\003 i,q n respectively Step3: Let T be the total number of transactions Step4: First, we find a minimum integer k such that is greater than or equal to the lower support threshold e, say S 1 and generate the interval [q 1 014 q k   Step5: Then, find a minimum integer k 2 k 2 k 1 ch that 1 1 2 1 S T c k k m m 002 000   and generate the interval [q k1+1 014 q k2   Step6: The remaining intervals are similarly computed Step7: If 1 1 2 1 S T c k k m m 002 000   the last generated interval q k\(j-1\1 014 q j  is c o m b ine d w ith [q kj+1 014 q n  o f o rm  the interval [q k\(j-1\1 014 q n   Fig 1: Partition Algorithm  3. Research Design The research design of this paper is divided into five stages: data collection, term preprocessing, term correlation, cluster analysis, and result evaluation. In data collection stage, this paper is mainly focused on military news documents. During the stage of term preprocessing, the keywords being representative of document are extracted to form a thesaurus. This stage involves the steps of Chinese term segment processing, N-Gram based term selection, meaning

consistency, and weight calculation of term. In term correlation stage, VSM, AR, and QAR approaches are applied to mine terms, and matrix of document vector, association matrix of terms, and association matrix of quantitative terms are established respectively. For cluster analysis stage, traditional VSM approach uses the cosine theorem to calculate the similarity degree between documents, and collocates with the HAC algo rithm to cluster together the documents; whereas both AR and QAR approaches use two-staged document cluster framework to execute cluster analysis. In the framework, the terms are first automatically clustered and then the score of document in each term cluster is calculated to classify the document into the specific term cluster with higher score. In the result evaluation stage, precision, recall, and F-measure are selected as evaluation metrics to analyze the cluster results.

News published in Youth Daily News [13   w h ic h is iss u ed  by Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan, R.O.C from June 2008 to February 2009 are collected as sample sources. Thus, 1026 news are acquired, and they can be divided into 14 categories in Chinese as shown in Table 1  3.2  Text Processing 1  Extraction and label of Chinese words The Chinese automatic phrase segment system CKIP \(Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing\ developed by Academia Sinica, is adopted in the paper to segment term for documents in Chinese  2  Selection of word characteristics In this paper, three categories of word characteristics, including noun \(3 subcategories verb \(15 subcategories\, and non-adjective \(1 subcategories\, are used to merge the word characteristics together for extracting the meaningful terms 000\003 Table 1. Quantity of news collections No. Category Quantity 1 a\\?da\\O Military justice and discipline 101 2 Ghk"Q Taiwan-China relations 223 3 2\033#\(%d'p Reserves and Mobilization 52 4 cwi\031\\¢P Force training 105 5 _V\\ô.\030 Information security 66 6 9ú%h Veterans service 102 7  All-out defense 58 8  Military disaster-relief 52 9 I∆9‡9ú%h Military housing service 33 10 7ËSA&{iU Muster-call 37 11 2Ra£0t Counseling work 51 12 R\035hk"Q Sino-U.S. relations 60 13 8thk"Q Sino-Japanese relations 34 14 NOSå@™KB Energy saving & carbon reduction  52 Total 1026  3  N-Gram based term selection Since the word segmented by CKIP belongs to an element with fundamental unit, this paper applies the N-Gram based term selection approach to merge the words so that the terms extracted out are more meaningful. Firstly, the contents of document are separated by 2-Gram or 3-Gram word combination. If the word frequency of co-occurrence for the segments of paired words or three sets of words is higher than a specific threshold, those segments are merged as an independent term. By the N-Gram based term selection approach, the terms with more completed meaning can be segmented, and the terms with recently fresh and popular meaning, such as those terms a,\005O\030 milk scandal 3 flexible diplomacy\í, and G charter flights between Taiwan and China\í, can be discovered Those terms used in the documents of professional domain, for example umci#iq physical isolation and cÑ7 postal service cooperation\í, can also 
197 
197 


be correctly segmented. Therefore, the terms selected in this approach have higher connections 4  Integration and modification of terms  The guidelines of integrating and modifying terms are set as follows  Rule 1 If the terms with same meaning are represented in different combination of words, then the term with higher occurrence frequency is selected as the term to be analyzed. For example, although i\007   000   and V~!I>†$\000'\033 are used to stand for the Mainland China 000  is selected as term to replace the others by this rule Rule 2 Term both in Chinese and English is unified For instance, MOU, CECA, and WHO are used to represent d`Z\034IrFï#\(2ge  P 2∂P"Bn and G€ZÍGÆO”P  respectively. By this rule, the abbreviation in English is chosen to stand for the term in Chinese Rule 3 If some nouns are too common and are weakly connected to news, such as 0õ9™,\021  wish Y2\033 future u8L implementation\í, and IÉ64 direct\, they will be deleted   3.3  Experimental Design The experiments are designed to analyze and compare the automatic clustering results by the approaches of VSM, AR, and QAR. In experiment A for the document vector matrix generated by VSM the HAC algorithm is applied to conduct the text automatic clustering. Traditional AR and QAR approaches are performed in experiments B and C respectively. In these two approaches, two-stage method is implemented to execute the automatic clustering. On the first stage, the HAC algorithm is used to carry out the automatic clustering on terms On the second stage, a comparative function  designed to calculate what the matching score of each document is in each term cluster produced on the first stage. If a document scores the highest score in a specific term cluster, the document is classified into this cluster. The experimental design is described as follows 1\periment A \(VSM method Step 1: Assign every news event as a vector in space Then, transfer the documents in all the sets to a vector space matrix Step 2: Use the cosine theorem to calculate the similarity degree between two documents. Let 1 D 000K and 2 D 000K denote the vector representative forms of the document 1 D and 2 D  respectively. The formula of the similarity degree between documents 1 D and 2 D is expressed as 000\003   2 1 2 1 2 1  cos D D D D D D    1 Step 3: Establish the vector matrix of similarity degree for the document   Step 4: Apply the HAC algorithm on the document to execute automatic clustering, and generate the results of text automatic clustering   2\periment B \(AR method Step 1: Apply AR approach to mine the term. Then assign the average confidence of term as the similarity degree, and establish the term matrix Step 2: Apply the HAC algorithm on the term to execute clustering, and generate the results of term automatic clustering Step 3: Use the compara tive function to calculate what the matching score of each document is in each term cluster. If a document scores the highest score in a specific term cluster the document is classified into this cluster 3\periment C \(QAR method All the steps are the same as those in experiment B except that the QAR approach replaces the AR approach in Step 1   3.4  Evaluation metrics R\d F-measure are usually used to evaluate the performance of information retrieval, this paper also uses these three performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy of text clustering. Let N t and N c be the classification results by man-made and automatic clustering, respectively Then, the formulas for P, R, and F-measure are defined as follows  c c t t c N N N P 003   2 t c t t c N N N R 003   3 t c t c t c t c t c R P R P F      2   4

4. Result analysis The accuracy evaluation results of experiments A B, and C are listed in Table 2, which shows that all three performance metrics of VSM approach are the worst when compared with those of AR and QAR The reason is each term is considered to be an independent state in the VSM approach  Table 2: Accuracy evaluation results  VSM AR QAR Precision 0.548 0.701 0.740 Recall 0.420 0.669 0.694 F-measure 0.453 0.681 0.714  In the AR approach, the relationship between terms is emphasized, so that the term rules mined by data mining technique have higher connection degree which improves the shortcoming of low connection degree by VSM approach. Compared with the VSM approach, the AR approach increases 0.228 in the F-measure metrics  In the QAR approach, the concept of quantity is taking into account in the word, which further emphasizes the relationship between terms. Since the terms with same meaning but with different quantity may have different connection degree with the other terms, the terms with different quantity are divided into some divisions. This procedure can more accurately mine the connection between terms Accordingly, the QAR approach increases 0.261 in the F-measure metrics when compared with the VSM approach. Furthermore, the performance comparisons between the AR and the QAR approaches reveal that the latter approach is 0.033 better than the former approach in each of precision, recall, and F-measure metrics. Therefore, applying the QAR approach can obtain the more accurate mining results and the better automatic clustering effects  Additionally, Table 3 exhibits the effects of automatic clustering on each category of news sample sources described in section 3.1 by applying the VSM, AR, and QAR approaches  For the F-measure metric, the effects of automatic clustering resulting from both the AR and QAR approaches are better than those resulting from the VSM approach. Moreover, Table 3 also shows that the QAR approach performs the best on 11 categories and the AR approach performs the best on 3 categories The comparisons of F-measure metric on each category among three approaches are represented in Fig. 3. In general, the QAR approach performs better than the AR and VSM approach  Table 3 000\003 Evaluation results on each category of news No. Category F-measure VSM AR QAR 1 a\\?da\\Oè\000\003 0.464 002 0.555 002 0.639 002 2 Ghk"Q\000\003 0.628 002 0.854 002 0.870 002 3 cwi\031\\¢PÉ\000\003 0.477 002 0.525 002 0.505 002 4 2\033#\(%d'p\000\003 0.342 002 0.737 002 0.765 002 5 _V\\ô.\030#˜\000\003 0.530 002 0.813 002 0.879 002 6 9ú%h\000\003 0.522 002 0.693 002 0.737 002 7 000\003 0.309 002 0.682 002 0.610 002 8 000\003 0.644 002 0.713 002 0.715 002 9 I∆9‡9ú%h\000\003 0.513 002 0.725 002 0.749 002 10 7ËSA&{iU\000\003 0.268 002 0.575 002 0.634 002 11 2Ra£0t!Î\000\003 0.260 002 0.594 002 0.644 002 12 R\035hk"Q\000\003 0.504 002 0.633 002 0.622 002 13 8thk"Q\000\003 0.387 002 0.699 002 0.793 002 14 NOSå@™KB\000\003 0.495 002 0.550 0.750   F-measure 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1234567891011121314 QAR AR VSM  Fig. 3: Comparisons of F-measure index among three approaches  5. Conclusion This paper applies both AR and QAR approaches to extract the terms with high connection, and integrates with the HAC algorithm to execute the automatic clustering on on-line Chinese military news documents. The accuracies of automatic clustering among the VSM, AR and QAR approaches are compared. Experimental results show that the F-measure metric of applying traditional VSM approach on automatic clustering is 0.453, the application of AR approach can increase the F-measure metric to 0.681, and finally the application of QAR approach can further enhance the F-measure metric to 0.714. Consequently, for the issue of Chinese document automatic clustering, this paper proposes an integrated approach of combining the 
199 
199 


QAR with the HAC algorithm to improve the quality of text automatic clustering. From the experimental results, it is concluded that the proposed integrated approach can effectively enhance the quality of text automatic clustering, and can obtain the more accurate effects of automatic clustering Because the news sample sources are collected from the military news published in Youth Daily News during the period between June 2008 and February 2009 and are reported from the stand point of military, the more sample sources should be expanded to the news from other newspapers and during the longer time periods and be from the other reporting perspectives in the future. Furthermore, for the future research direction, the concept of semantic analysis can be taking into account to more clearly present the connection between terms for the objective of improving the effects of automatic clustering  Acknowledgements This research was partially sponsored by the project of Management College, National Defense University in 2009  References   Chen, H., 2001, Knowledge Management Systems: A Text Mining Perspective. , Tucson Ariz.: The University of Arizona   Chen,C.C., 2006, Using Efficient Algorithms for Mining Quantitative Association Rules journal of Information Technology and Applications, Vol.1, No.2, September, pp 123-131   Chen, C.M., Chang, M.H., Chiu, W.C., 2008 An Intelligent News Search Engine with Topic Map User Interface Based on Automatic Query Expansion, Journal of Library and Information Science, Vol. 34, No.2, pp.19-41   Chiu, D.Y., Pan, Y.C., 2006, Combining Information Retrieval and Clustering Algorithm to Construct an Knowledge Map Journal of Information Management, Vol.13 No.S, pp.137-160   Chuang, S.L., Chien, L.F. 2002, Toward automatic generation of query taxonomy: a hierarchical query clustering approach.

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the dataís semantic. This step consists of TAHís and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
