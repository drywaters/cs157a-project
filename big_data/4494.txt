This paper presents a new WSD method which is based on the mining association rules. The method can mine the association rules between the sense of the ambiguous word and its context, to construct an association rules based database. At last the sense of the ambiguous word is marked by choosing the sense which the most association rules define. The experiment result shows that the method has high precision  Keywords-natural language processing;word sense disambiguation; mining assosiation rules I  I NTRODUCTION  Word sense disambiguation is very important in many fields of Natural Language Processing, such as information retrieval, the example-based machine translating system, semantic analysis, syntax analysis speech recognition, text-to-speech and so on[1  A s an  important research field, many research institutes and colleges have devoted much energy to do related research. Word sense disambiguation is to define the sense of the ambiguous word according to its context Given the word W with N senses, in the specific context C the word W has a confined sense  S The task of WSD is to choose the determined sense from the N senses. The whole process can be defined by the follow formula       max arg  C S R S k  1 Some methods have already been used to disambiguate the ambiguous word sense. Quan Changqin[3 p r es en t e d a m e th od of  w o rd  s e n s e  disambiguation based on multi-classifier decision, the method trained the committee classifiers by learning a smallest of labeled examples and then these classifiers were updated dynamically by unlabeled examples, the sense of ambiguous words were determined by combining the decision of the final committee classifiers. Yang Erho de scr i b e d a  Chi ne s e  w o r d  sense disambiguation method based on primitive cooccurrence data, which overcome the problem of data sparseness using the property of the HowNet[5 U s i n g  the word definition in the HowNet, the primitive cooccurrence data matrix was obtained, which were collected from a corpus of about 100000 characters without any manual tagging Based on all of the previous research, this paper proposes a new WSD method based on the mining association rules, which can mine the association rules between the sense of the ambiguous word and its context, to construct an association rules - based database. At last the sense of the ambiguous word is determined by choosing the sense which the most association rules deduced II  W ORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION BASED ON MINING ASSOCIATION RULES  A  Description of the Association Rules To mine the association rules is to discover the important relevance between the items in a transaction database. In the association rules, the item sets I={i 1 i 2 i n  is the set which includes n different items Given a transaction database D, each transaction record in it is a subset of the sets I. The association rule is described as Y X 000 here I X 002  I Y 002  and 003 004 Y X 000\037 Its support degree and confidence degree are separately defined as follow formulas  D T Y T X D T  Y X  support 005 005 006  000 2  X  support  Y X  support  Y X  confidence 000  000 3 The task of mining association rules is to discover all of the strong association rules. The support degree of the rules is no less than the threshold of support degree and the confidence degree is no less than the threshold of the confidence degree From formula \(2\, the support degree reflects the frequency of the relation Y X 000 occurring in the transaction database D. The item set, which frequency is more than the threshold, is a frequent item sets. So we think the production of the frequent item sets is

because there is some correlation between the corresponding items B  Basic Idea of the WSD Algorithm Based on Mining Association Rules In the paper, the context of an ambiguous word is regarded as a transaction record, the words in the context and the senses of the ambiguous word are regarded as items. If some items frequently occur together in some transactions \(the context of the ambiguous word\ then there must be some correlation between the items. The paper redefines the meanings of the formula \(2\and formula \(3\ Given an ambiguous word, Y presents the set of the senses of the word, X means the set of its context words. The item sets I includes all senses of the ambiguous word and all words of its context. The database D is the context document sets of the word, each record T is a context of the word. The association rule Y X means that the sense of the word can be determined by its context The basic idea of the WSD algorithm based on mining association rules is: to discover the frequent item sets composed of the sense of the ambiguous word and its context by scanning its context database, which support degree is no less than the threshold of support degree; to produce the association rules Y X which confidence degree is no less than the threshold of the confidence degree from maximum frequent item sets; at last to determine the sense of the ambiguous word by choosing the sense which the most association rules deduced In the producing process of the frequent item sets there are too many words in the item sets which leads to produce too many N-frequent item sets \(here, N is a large number\. According to Martin’s research  5 words in each pre and post of the core word may provide 95% semantic collocated information, so in this paper N is no more than 10. In the research, there are more items in the frequent item sets, theirs frequency occurring in the context database is less, theirs support degree is less. But these frequent item sets are helpful to the WSD. In order to avoid to loss these frequent item sets, the paper gives different min-support degree according to different N-frequent item sets. N is larger the min-support degree is smaller. N is smaller, the degree is larger. The association rule Y X which confidence degree is no less than the threshold of the confidence degree, is produced C  WSD Algorithm Based on Mining Association Rules Given an ambiguous word, firstly choose the association rules from the association rules database according to its context words, the selected rules may be more than one; they are all used in WSD. At last the sense of the ambiguous word is determined by the rules committee voting, the sense which is decided by the most rules is selected as the sense of the ambiguous word in its context. The algorithm is as follows   Step1: Produce the frequent item sets   Step1.1:  Generate the 1-candidate sets according to the context database, scan the database to obtain their support degree, select the candidate sets which support degree is no less than the threshold of support degree to formulate the 1-frenquent item sets   Step1.2: Use N-frequent item sets to generate N+1-candidate sets, set a smaller threshold of support degree, rescan the database to obtain their support degree, select the candidate sets which degree is no less than the threshold to formulate the N+1-frenquent item sets   Step1.3: Try the step1.2 again and again, until no N+1 candidate sets generates or N is more than 10. Get all frequent item sets which satisfy the condition   Step2: Produce the association rules Y X  from maximum frequent item sets according to the threshold of the confidence degree   Step3: Given an ambiguous word, choose the association rules according to its context words At last the sense of the ambiguous word is determined by the rules committee voting. The sense, which is decided by the most rules, is selected as the sense of the ambiguous word in its context   Step4: Output the sense   Step5: End the program III  E XPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS  There aren’t standard data sources for Chinese WSD. So we download the free sentences including ambiguous words material”, “information quality alter”, “amend behavior information”, “show off”, “show healthy advantageous”, “health”, “normal”\from the Center for Chinese Linguistics PKU to construct our test data. The sentence is extracted as the units of the context of the ambiguous words. If the length of the sentence is less than 5, the sentence is deleted. In the experiments, the senses of the ambiguous word come from HowNet2008. The term of precision is conducted to evaluate the system, the formula is as follows  all corr num num precision  4 The result shows as in table 1. The results in table 2 come from document [7

Because the two methods use different semantic dictionary, to the same ambiguous word, there are different sense definition and different sense number. This method can not compare directly with Li’s method. In the whole, the precision with this paper method is higher than the precision with Li’s method IV  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we propose a new WSD method based on the mining association rules, which can mine the association rules between the sense of the ambiguous word and its context, and the sense of the ambiguous word is determined by choosing the sense which the most association rules deduced. The experimental results show that the precision obtained by our algorithm is higher than other algorithms. However, our algorithm still has some small drawbacks. More research will be done to improve our algorithm performance in the future, which is to improve the method of mining association rules A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by the Research Foundation of Shandong Economic University \(No.01611320\ The authors are grateful for the anonymous reviewers who made constructive comments  R EFERENCES  1  Nancy Ide and Jean Veronis. “Introduction to the special issue on word sense disambiguation: the state of the art”.

  3.5. Descriptive Statistics  The mean scores of the constructs were calculated as shown in Table 3. The mean scores on a 5-point scale are about 4 for loyalty, customer satisfaction, product quality and service quality, suggesting moderately positive evaluation of the supermarket patronized most often. The average ratings of personality traits are 4.03 for extraversion and 2.55 for neuroticism, implying the respondents feature distinctive outgoing personality  Table 3 also shows the correlations among the constructs As having been hypothesized, customer satisfaction product quality, service quality, and extraversion are positively correlated with loyalty. The negative relationship between neuroticism and loyalty, however, is not that significant. Customer satisfaction, product quality, and service quality are positively correlated while extraversion and neuroticism are negatively correlated, as previous literat ure so suggested   Table 3 Descriptive statistics of the variables   Mean Std LO CS PQ SQ EX LO 4.12 0.44 CS 4.05 0.39 0.50      PQ 4.05 0.42 0.25  0.28     SQ 3.94 0.53 0.26  0.19  0.35    EX 4.03 0.43 0.25  0.08 0.01 0.08  NE 2.55 0.71 -0.02 0.01 0.01 0.07 -0.21  p<0.01   4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS  Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis. In order to reduce multicollinearity between the main effect variables and their interaction terms, all main effect variables were mean centered prior to the creation of interaction terms 26 The data for the two supermarkets were analyzed combined together. A variable \(STORE\was created to reflect the two supermarkets with Wumart stores as reference group in this study. Three regression models were established. The first one included the direct effects of customer satisfaction, service quality and product quality. The difference of loyalty between Carrefour and Wumart was also illustrated in this model. The second model added the main effects of extraversion and neuroticism to analyze the role of these two variables in the formation of consumer loyalty. Finally, the model explored the interaction effects of personality traits and customer satisfaction. The three models were evaluated as table 4   Model 1 has shown, consistent with previous studies that customer satisfaction and service quality has significant positive impact on loyalty. H 1 and H 3 are supported. The positive effect of product quality however, is not proved in this study. A reasonable and plausible explaination is that products there are mainly low involvement goods for daily use, consumers rather pay more attention to the service in the retail environment, especially for the formation of purchase behavior or repurchase behavior. What is also salient lies in the inference that customer satisfaction may play a mediating role in the relationship between product quality and loyalty, since the correlation between the two variables is significantly positive as shown in Table 3 Hence, the direct effect of product quality on loyalty is not significant in this study, H 3 is not supported  Consumers dispaly a higher level of loyalty for Wumart stores than that for Carefour stores as the variable of STORE has significant negative impact on the dependent variable. A possible reason is that the age distribution of consumers are different between the two supermarkets As previously stated, Wumart are largely sponsored by senior consumers group who have limited information-processing capabilities and tend to stick to a store brand than the yonger group does 4   We added the main effects of extraversion and neuroticism in Model 2, and the R-squared value increased significantly. The coefficients of the two variables demonstrated that the main effect of extraversion is in place as it has significant positive impact on loyalty, Hypothesis 4 is supported. As opposed to hypothesis 5, neuroticism does not significantly affect customer loyalty  Table 4 Hierarchical regression results  Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Constant 4.17** 4.16** 4.17 CS 0.50** 0.49** 0.50 PQ 0.08 0.08 0.09 SQ 0.13** 0.12** 0.11 STORE a  0.10* -0.09* -0.09 EX  0.20** 0.21 NE  -0.01 0.00 EX CS  0.12 NE CS  0.12 R 2 0.29 0.33 0.34 R 2 Change  0.04 0.01 p<0.01;*p<0.1 a, Wumart as refreence group   The moderating effect of these two personality traits were further analyzed in Model 3. Consistent with Hypothesis 7, the moderating effect of neuroticism is proved, while Hypothesis 6 about moderating effect of extraversion is not supported. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the effect of interactions graphically. Consumers of high extraversion inclination are readily loyal to the store brand than consumers with low extraversion aptitude The relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty are weaker for consumers with high neuroticism inclination, and vice versa. The personality trait of neuroticism displays a significant moderating effect on the customer satisfaction-loyalty link. The interaction 


 effect of extraversion, and the main effect of neuroticism on loyalty, however, are not significant in this study   Figure 2 Interactions of customer satisfaction and neuroticism   Figure 3 Interactions of customer satisfaction and extraversion  5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS  Previous research has largely neglected the issue of moderating effects of implicit factors, e.g. personality traits, on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. Against this background, the moderating impacts of extraversion and neuroticism traits on the satisfaction-loyalty link are investigated in this study The results reveal that extraversion aptitude has significant positive effect on customer loyalty, whereas neuroticism inclination is detrimental to the association between customer satisfaction and loyalty. The results also shed light on the importance of customer satisfaction and service quality as the literature has already suggested. Re-formulating and executing a refined strategy that improve service quality and enhance customer satisfaction will be the top priority for management in the retail context  The outcome of this research work makes a significant contribution to fill the gap in the literature of customer satisfaction and loyalty. It does so by providing a deep insight at the role of personality traits in the formation of loyalty. The classical CRM strategy to improve loyalty through increasing satisfaction is not always applicable to every customer un-distinguishably; rather it depends on the personality characteristics of consumer. Service marketing practitioners can also benefit from this research in discovering the origin and evolution of customer loyalty to formulate and execute appropriate marketing strategies. This study not only confirms the past findings in the extant body of literature that service quality and customer satisfaction play a crucial role in loyalty, but also discloses the implication of their dependence on consumers personality characteristic. It is important for companies to discriminate customer groups who rely on satisfaction as the mediating driver to underpin loyalty from groups who are less sensitive to the satisfaction-loyalty conjugation 5 This research outcome indicates that an across-the-board CRM strategies to increase customer satisfaction not necessarily yields higher level of loyalty that is generally believed to be the antecedent of company profitability Consumers with neuroticism trait subject to the tendency of store switching, building a long term intimate relations with them could be a target too far to reach  This research comes with some limitations and subsequent opportunities for further study. First, the main effect of neuroticism and the moderating effect of extraversion didnt manifest themselves in this study The purchase decision in a grocery supermarket context involves complicated factors besides product and service quality. Other considerations such as pricing, promotion discounting, food safety, country of origin, the use of private brand, and etc. inevitably interfere with the decision making process of customers in terms of repeat purchase. Applying the model to other contexts like specific product category or pure service industry can be the alternative to see the role of personality traits in the customer satisfaction-loyalty link. Second, we have focused on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. It would be desirable to analyze the role of personality traits in the formation process of customer satisfaction, and loyalty-profitability associations, in that way, we can from a broader perspective to gain a deeper insight into the impact of personality characteristics on consumption behavior Finally, reliability and validity of some constructs are not so satisfactory owing to the exploratory nature of this study. Further investigations are needed in the future to explore the functions of personality in consumer choice and behavior

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnt create sound clips  A5.1 We dont need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIs   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
