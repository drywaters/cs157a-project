In this way, the application of data mining tools would be very useful to understand citizen's needs In this paper, focusing on the CiRM concept, we apply a data mining framework on the database of Tehran municipality 
This framework consists of clustering and the association rule to improve citizen satisfaction. The main objective is to find the factors those affect the rate of satisfaction Firstly, we use the K-means algorithm to cluster the subjects that cause citizens complaint. Every data point is identified in terms of the following features: the frequency, the number of days that at least one complaint occurred and the interval time between the first and the latest time of each subject during a season. Secondly, the association rule is used to identify the factors that affect the rate of satisfaction in the cluster of 
subjects that occur regularly during the season and have a high number of complaints. The results of the research are very useful to build a strategy recommendation system in order to improve the rate of citizens' satisfaction. This study could be notable as one of the first studies on using data mining tools in CiRM Keywords- Citizen Relationshi p Management \(CiRM\n service management system; Data mining; Clustering Association rule I  I NTRODUCTION  The governmental services are one of the most primitive 
and predominant service domains in any community with a wide array of services. As such, urban services and the concept of citizen relationship management \(CiRM\ are currently gaining importance in this domain [7, 8   The main purpose of CiRM is to understand the needs of different citizen groups and to provide respective services for each group accordingly. In this way, many governments are actively promoting the use of ICT. Sasaki, T., A.Watanabe Y. and Minamino, K. \(2007\clared in [8 h a t t h e m a i n  issues of this approach are "how e-governments can manage 
effectively" and "be more citizen-oriented". In other words ICT can be strategically significant in promoting egovernment effectiveness through understanding the citizen requirements. In this domain, the application of data mining tools seems to be useful. Appropriate data mining tools which are good at extracting and identifying useful information and knowledge from enormous customer databases, are one of the best supporting tools to obtain a deeper understanding of citizen’s characteristics and needs In this paper, focusing on CiRM, we apply data mining 
tools to improve citizen satisfaction. We use the database of Tehran municipality to find the most important citizens needs. The main objective of this paper is to find those subjects that have a high number of complaints, the root of them and the factors that affect the rate of satisfaction In order to accomplish this objective, we use a framework that consists of the clustering of subjects in terms of the frequency, the time interval between the first and the latest time and the number of days that at least one complaint of each subject occurred and extracting the association of the 
items which was identified as the prior citizens' needs via the cluster analysis. The result of this research is expected to be useful for development of citizen satisfaction The remaining of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review the studies related to CiRM, clustering and the association rule. In Section 3, we introduce the hybrid method that we use. In Section 4, we apply the proposed model on the data of Tehran municipality in Iran

Finally, we conclude in Section 5 and summarize the study results which provide valuable information for the effective management of urban services II  L ITERATURE REVIEW  In this section, we briefly review related studies of the Citizen Relationship Management, clustering, K-means algorithm, association rule and the Apriori algorithm A  CiRM Citizen Relationship Management is the application of customer relationship management \(CRM\n an e governmental context and establishment guiding principles on how customer relations can be effectively strategized in the public sector. Specifically, it talks about the differences in CRM practices between public and private institutions 7   The essential purpose of CiRM is to change governmentoriented management into citizen-oriented one in governments. In this way, it is necessary to understand what citizen needs and improve the citizen satisfaction. In fact CiRM applies CRM \(Customer Relationship Management to improve citizen satisfaction [7, 8   Pan S Tan C Lim, E. \(2006 claimed in [7 th a t  despite the irrefutable relevance of customer relations in influencing the adoption of e-government systems, there has not been a corresponding rise in the study of CRM practices within the context of public eservices 1  Using ICT in CiRM As discussed in the previous section, understanding citizen's needs and improving the citizen satisfaction are the most important points in CiRM. In this way, channels to understand citizen's needs are required. So, it is necessary to restructure the inner environment and communication tools for sharing opinion that citizens think. By the progress of ICT, it has been easy to achieve [8  M a ny t o ol s a r e used  t o  connect between public office and citizen by the advantage of ICT, but according to Sasaki,T., A.Watanabe,Y. and Minamino,K.\(2007\n  t h e  p ubl i c s e c t or i s no t  a b l e t o  provide citizen-oriented services because of the bureaucratic sectionalism. The way to solve this problem is to introduce the citizen's voice database" which all public officers are able to access the database. By using this kind of call center it is possible to contact between the government and citizens and a review and a feedback process at the whole public office is constructed. However, it is important not only to construct the review and feedback process but also managing the framework to apply the opinion from citizens and the knowledge management to share their knowledge are effective and required[8  In t h is  w a y   th e ap pl ic ati o n of da t a  mining tools is expected to be useful Many researchers have used data mining tools in CRM but based on our researches, no one has used data mining techniques for CiRM. Ngai, .E.W.T., Xiu, L. and Chau D.C.K. \(2008\ declared in [6 h a t A p p r opr i a t e  d a t a m i ni ng tools, which are good at extracting and identifying useful information and knowledge from enormous customer databases, are one of the best supporting tools for making different CiRM decisions Data mining techniques could be applied to discover unseen patterns of citizens' complaints. The root of the problems may also be uncovered by investigating the association between complaints from different citizens B  Clustering Clustering is the process of grouping a set of data objects into groups such that objects from the same cluster are more similar and the objects from different clusters are more dissimilar [4 The difference between clustering and classification is that clusters are unknown at the time the algorithm starts. In fact, there are no predefined classes in clustering. Common tools for clustering include neural networks and discrimination analysis Clustering techniques have been used in CRM by Many researchers [1, 5   Bu t  bas e d  on ou r r e s e ar ch n o  on e h a s  applied cluster analysis for citizen relationship management 1  K-means algorithm K-means is one of the well-known algorithms for clustering and it has been used extensively in various fields including data mining, statistical data analysis and other business applications[2  The K-m e a n s a l go rithm fo r  partitioning is based on the mean value of the objects in the cluster The K-means algorithm proceeds as follows First, it randomly selects K of the objects, each of which initially represents a cluster mean or center. For each of the remaining objects, an object is assigned to the cluster to which it is the most similar, based on the distance between the object and the cluster mean. It then computes the new mean for each cluster. This process iterates until the criterion function converges. Typically, the square-error criterion is used for cluster evaluation [4   C  Association rule According to Tan, P., Steinbach, M. and Kumar, V 2006\in [9 sso ci a t i o n ai m s t o e s t a b l i s h  r e l a t i o n shi p s  between items which exist together in a given record. An association rule is an implication expression of the form X 001 Y where X and Y are disjoint itemsets, i.e 002  003 Y X  The strength of an association rule can be measured according to the support and confidence metrics The support metric determines how often a rule is satisfied in the transaction database. It is obtained by dividing the support count for Y X 004 by the total number of transactions. The confidence metric determines how often items in Y appear in transactions that contain X Originally, association rules emerged in the domain of shops and customers. It is one of the most commonly used data mining techniques in CRM. Market basket analysis is a typical example of this technique. Storekeepers use the results of market basket analysis for various marketing purposes, such as how to decide on what to put on sale, how to place merchandize on shelves to maximize a cross selling effect, and how to advertise. The association rule is not limited to marketing problems. It is widely applied to other decision making problems [3, 6

Association techniques have been used in CRM by Many researchers [1, 5   Bu t  bas e d  on ou r r e s e ar ch n o  on e h a s  used association rules for citizen relationship management Common tools for association modeling are statistics and apriori algorithms [6   W e u s e a p ri o r i alg o rith m in  th is p a p e r  to extract the association rules. The main characteristics of this algorithm are summarized as follows 1. Apriori is a level-wise algorithm that generates frequent itemsets one level at-a-time, from itemsets of size-1 to the longest frequent itemsets 2. At each level, new candidate itemsets are created using frequent itemsets discovered at the previous level 3. At each level, the transaction database is scanned once to determine the actual support count of every candidate itemset[9 III  M ETHODOLOGY  In this study, we use a hybrid method incorporating clustering and association rule in to a data mining approach in order to offer useful strategic information for different kinds of complaints. It enables the municipality to find the important points for effective management of urban services At first, we use clustering analysis to group the subjects that may cause citizens complaint. After that, we use association rules to discover the correlation among items that affect the rate of citizen satisfaction in the preferred cluster The mining process is introduced step by step as follows At step 1, we divide the subjects which cause complaint into several groups using K-Means clustering via following three measures 1- Frequency of complaints: frequency refers to the number of complaints of each subject during a season, for example 100 times during the winter 2- Time interval between complaints: time interval refers to the interval between the first and the latest time that a complaint of each subject happened during a season, for example 22 days 3- Number of days: number of days refers to the number of days that at least one complaint of each subject occurred The advantage of clustering analysis is useful to identify groups of complaints with similar characteristics In step 2, we use association rules to determine which factors affect the satisfaction rate in those kinds of complaints which occur permanently during the season with a high frequency IV  C ASE STUDY  The Tehran municipality constructed an urban service management system by using the ICT technology to connect between the municipality and citizens to improve citizens satisfaction. This system is focusing on managing the complaints against urban services and requirements. This call center has been established to provide appropriate and timely responses to citizens' demands and complaints. Currently, the urban service management system responses more than 3500 phone calls per day The database of this system includes proper information about citizens' needs and would be a key to new services and point of improvement. The data warehouse stores detailed information about citizens' calls; so we know when, why and at which point of geographical region, a complaint occurred Many researchers have used data mining tools in CRM but based on our research, no one has used data mining for CIRM. Besides, the number of articles focusing on the application of data mining techniques in complaints management is low A  The pre-processing phase Raw data of this study are one-year complaint data of the data warehouse from 2007/03/21 to 2008/03/19. This dataset is composed of 45 data fields and 1,116,249 records of complaints. We apply the 2-step method on the data which refers to the winter and 5 data fields among 45 data fields We substitute the mode value for missing values and eliminate inaccurate values. The fields and an example of the data are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively As the citizens' needs may be different from one geographical region to another, we use the hybrid method for each region As discussed in the previous section we decide to cluster the subjects via the following features: the frequency, the number of days that at least one complaint occurred and the interval time between the first and the latest time of each subject during a season At first, we should calculate the above attributes for each subject.  In order to accomplish this objective, we create a new field as 'day of season' from the 'message time' field that shows the day of season on which the complaint occurred for example the second day, the fifty forth day or the ninth day. By creating this field, it is possible to calculate the number of days on which each subject occurred and the time interval. Now a dataset is created that each data point shows a subject and is characterized by the proposed attributes  TABLE I  THE DEFINITION OF ATTRIBUTES           TABLE II  THE EXAMPLE OF DATA          ID Attribute definition 1 Subject ID The kind of complaint 2 Region The geographical point that a complaint occurs 3 Message Time The time of complaint 4 unit ID The unit of the municipality that is responsible for the complaint 5 Last state ID The state of being satisfied or dissatisfied  Complaint ID Subject ID Region Message Time unit ID Last state ID 12 413 7 07/02/2008 10:16 250 27 13 420 15 07/02/2008 10:16 154 28

B  Clustering In this section, we use the K-means algorithm to cluster the subjects which cause complaint in region 1, via the frequency, the time interval and the number of days The K-means algorithm is required to define the number of initial clusters K. For that, we run the K-means algorithm using different values of K. according to the results, the K=3 is a suitable choice for K. The results are shown in table 3 Based on the results, two items has been identified as outliers that refer to 'the removal of ice from slippery paths and 'clearing snow from roads and paths' subjects and the remaining items are segmented in to three clusters, while 68 subjects belong to cluster 1, 34 subjects belong to cluster 2 and 32 subjects belong to cluster 3 We also use the Tow-Step algorithm which has the advantage of automatically estimating the optimal number of clusters and handling large datasets. The result of the Two Step algorithm shows that the number of clusters is three The characteristics of each group are as follows Cluster 1: most of the items in this cluster refer to the collection and installation', 'trees' and 'parks and green lands', 'employees behavior' and 'animals' problems. The average of the interval time is about 78, but the frequency and the number of days are on average 19 and 29 respectively. It means that these kinds of needs occur sometimes during the winter and not during a specified period of time; they occur almost during the whole winter with a low frequency Cluster 2: most of the subjects in this cluster refer to the construction' and 'traffic' problems. The average of frequency, interval time and the number of days are about 5 13 and 4 respectively. It means that citizens grumble occasionally about these kinds of subjects and not during the whole winter. It seems that citizens are rather neutral about these subjects Cluster 3: most of the items in this cluster refer to the garbage and waste', 'cleaning', and 'asphalt'. The average of frequency, interval time and the number of days are about 358, 86 and 70 respectively. It means that these kinds of complaints occur permanently during the whole winter with a high frequency. It is notable that both subjects which we eliminated as outliers have the same characteristics as this cluster. Therefore, the complaints which refer to the 'snow garbage and waste', 'cleaning' and 'asphalt' occur with the highest frequency and need more attention as the prior citizens' needs  TABLE III  T HE RESULTS OF KMEANS ALGORITHM      C  Association rules As discussed in the previous section, the 'snow', 'garbage and waste', 'cleaning' and 'asphalt' are specified as the important prior citizens' needs in region 1 and the municipality should give the top priority to them. These kinds of complaints include 15 different subjects. The results show that 80 percents of the complaints in this region refer to the above subjects The last state ID shows the state of being satisfied or not We use this field and the subject to find the conditions in which citizens are dissatisfied. The results show that citizens are pleased about the service of the municipality in 11 subjects but are not always satisfied with the four remaining items which are identified in table 4. The feedback information shows that the performance of municipality in handling these kinds of complaints is sometimes acceptable but not often Now, we use the association rules to find the factors that affect the state of satisfaction in handling these kinds of complaints. We analyze association rules using apriori algorithm by four input fields and confidence levels of 75 Table 5 shows 8 examples of the results. These rules show the state of satisfaction according to the month on which the complaint occurs and the responsible unit. For example the seventh rule means that when a complaint of asphalt layer' occurs in the first month of winter and the unit 250 is responsible for handling it, the state of satisfaction is dissatisfied with the probability of 100 The rules make it possible to understand the effect of time of complaint' and 'unit' for each subject on the rate of satisfaction Generally, a high rate of support and confidence has a strong mutual relation. But significant association rules are those which have a lift value higher than 1. All rules have shown the lift measure above 1. Therefore, we can say that the rules have a strong relationship Some results of this research are as follows The subjects of 'snow', 'garbage and waste', 'cleaning and 'asphalt' occur permanently during the whole winter with a high frequency. So, the municipality performance is not proper in providing services which related with these subjects and the municipality should give top priority to the above items     TABLE IV  T HE DEFINITION OF SUBJECTS           K 2 3 4 5 6 SSE 52.32 22.88 46.28 34.22 30.21  Subject ID Subject definition 379 asphalt settlement 380 asphalt layer 413 Garbage collection 524 Installation of garbage ban  
280 


TABLE V  E XAMPLES OF ASSOCIATION RULES         The municipality performance is not proper in handling the complaints which refer to 'asphalt settlement', 'asphalt layer', 'garbage collection' and 'installation of garbage ban subjects The probability of being satisfied is 70% in the last month of winter The unit 82 which refers to the section 2 of region 1 has the best performance in the third month of winter in comparison with the other months in handling the 'garbage collection subject The performance of municipality in handling the complaints of 'installation of garbage ban' subject in the first month of winter is very perfect and citizens feel satisfied with the probability of 100 The unit 83 which refers to the geographical section 3 of this region has the best performance and can be seen as a benchmark for the other sections Citizens feel dissatisfied with the unit 87 which refers to the section 5 of this region with the probability of 95%. This unit has a good performance just in handling the complaints which refer to the 'asphalt settlement' subject The subjects of 'asphalt layer' and 'garbage collection cause a high number of complaints in the first month of winter while the municipality performance is worse  V  C ONCLUSTION  Governments have to consider convenient channels and services to connect between the governmental managers and citizens.  Furthermore, data mining tools are needed to manage citizens' requirements and process which collect analyze, reflect, and evaluate their needs In this research, we have used clustering and association rules on the data of the urban service management system in Iran to find the subjects that cause complaint and the factors that affect the rate of satisfaction. The results show that the municipality should give top priority to the 'snow', 'garbage and waste', 'cleaning' and 'asphalt' requirements and specially to the 'asphalt settlement', 'asphalt layer', 'Garbage collection and 'Installation of garbage ban' subjects during the winter in geographical region1 Analyzing the rules, make it possible to understand the impact of factors such as time and responsible units on the rate of satisfaction. Besides, units with a perfect or worse performance in providing services and handling complaints are identified The results of the research are very beneficial in providing improved urban services and the development of citizens' satisfaction.

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
