Classification techniques 
Phishing websites is the process of enticing people to visit fraudulent ebanking websites and persuading them to enter identity information such as usemames and passwords The information is then used to impersonate victims in order to empty their bank accounts run fraudulent auctions launder money and so on The word phishing from the phrase website phishing is a variation on the word fishing The idea is that bait is thrown out with the hopes that a user

effective method that uses Data Mining algorithms and tools to detect e-banking phishing websites in an Artificial Intelligent technique Associative and classification algorithms can be very useful in predicting Phishing websites can give us answers about what are the most important e-banking phishing website characteristics and indicators and how they relate with each other Comparing between different Data Mining Classification and Association methods and techniques is also a goal of this investigation The

2 Literature Review 
A report by Gartner estimated the costs at 1,244 per victim an increase over the 257 they cited in a 2004 report In 2007 Moore and Clayton estimated the number of phishing victims by examining web server logs They estimated that 311,449 people fall for 
phishing scams annually  costing around 350 million dollars There are several promising defending approaches to this problem reported earlier One approach is to stop phishing at the email level since most current phishing attacks use broadcast email spam to lure victims to a phishing website Another approach is to use security toolbars The phishing filter in IE7 is a toolbar approach with more features such as blocking the user's activity with a detected phishing site A third approach is to visually differentiate the phishing sites from the spoofed legitimate sites Dynamic Security Skins proposes to use a randomly generated visual hash to customize

generating the cluster not only yields more accurate clusters but is also advantageous as it is directly applicable to the real time data repository. Moreover, it effectively eliminates noisy transactions from the transaction database. The methodology used for this algorithm, also lead to a better way of calculating Support and hence provides new insights in non-binary data clustering Further studies will concentrate on testing the algorithm on real environment in order to prove its practical utility and in extending the algorithm for clustering transactions involving heterogeneous items in non-dataset  6 References  1 g ra w a l R I m ie lin sk i T  S w a m i A     M in in g  association rules between sets of items in large databases Intl.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
