In this paper, we further handle the problem of maintaining the HUP tree in dynamic databases A HUP maintenance algorithm has thus been proposed for efficiently handling new transactions. The proposed algorithm can reduce the cost of re-constructing the HUP tree when new transactions are inserted. Experimental results also show that it indeed executes faster than the batch maintenance algorithm and generates nearly the same tree structure as the batch one The proposed maintenance algorithm can thus achieve a good trade-off between execution time and tree complexity Keywords: utility mining; maintenance; HUP tree; high utility pattern I   I NTRODUCTION  Mining frequent itemsets from a transaction database is a fundamental task for knowledge discovery. In the past numerous methods were proposed to discover frequent itemsets [1    4   T h e appr oa c h e s co ul d be  d i vi d e d i n t o  two categories: level-wise approaches and pattern-growth approaches. The Aprori algorithm w a s f i rs t p r op os ed t o  mine association rules based on a level-wise processing way The FP-growth algorithm was then proposed to construct a compressed tree structure and to mine rules based on it [9   In the above approaches, it treats all the items in a database as binary variables. In this case, frequent itemsets just reveal the occurrence importance of the itemsets in the transactions, but do not reflect any other implicit factors such as prices or profits Utility mining [12  1 3  w a s th u s p r o p o se d  t o  p a rti a lly  solve the above problem. It may be thought of as an extension of frequent-itemset mining with sold quantities and item profits considered. Liu et al presented the two-phase algorithm for fast discovering all high utility itemsets [10  based on the downward-closure property. Lin et al proposed an HUP-tree structure to construct a tight tree structure and keep related mining information, such that the database scan time can be greatly reduced. The HUP tree is a little like the FP-tree structure except that each node has been attached an array quan_Ary to keep the quantities of its prefix items in the path for later mining process. The HUP-growth mining algorithm was proposed to derive high utility itemsets from the HUP-tree structure In the HUP-tree approach, all transactions are processed in a batch way. The previously constructed HUP-tree structure may not be valid when the new transactions are inserted into the database incrementally. In this paper, an incrementally updated HUP \(abbreviated as iHUP maintenance algorithm is thus proposed. It modifies the batch procedure of constructing the HUP-tree structure for incrementally mining, which makes the tree update easier Experimental results also show that the proposed iHUP maintenance algorithm has a better performance than the batch HUP algorithm II  R ELATED W ORKS  In this section, some related researches are briefly reviewed. They are the FUP \(fast updated\orithm and the HUP-tree \(high utility pattern tree\orithm A  The FUP algorithm One common type of data mining is to derive association rules from transaction data, such that the presence of certain items in a transaction will imply the presence of some other items   real-w o r ld applications, transaction databases usually grow over time and the association rules mined from them must be re-evaluated. Considering an original database and some new inserted transactions, the following four cases illustrated in Figure 1 may aris    Original database New transactions Large Itemsets Small Itemsets Large Itemsets Small Itemsets Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4  Figure 1  Four cases when new transactions are inserted into an existing database

Since itemsets in Case 1 are frequent \(large\in both the original database and the new transactions, they will still be frequent \(large\fter the weighted average of the counts Similarly, itemsets in Case 4 will still be non-frequent small\fter the new transactions are inserted. Thus Cases 1 and 4 will not affect the final frequent \(large\msets. Case 2 may remove existing frequent \(large\ itemsets, and Case 3 may add new frequent \(large\msets. Based on the FUP approach, the cases 1, 2 and 4 are more efficiently handled than conventional batch mining algorithms B  The HUP-tree algorithm In association-rule mining, only binary itemsets are considered in a database. In real-world applications, however frequent itemsets just reveal the occurrence of itemsets in transactions, but do not reflect any other important factors such as prices or profits. High profitable products but with low frequencies may thus not be found in traditional association-rule mining. Yao et al proposed the utility model by considering both quantities and profits of items [12  1 3    Chan et al proposed the topic of utility mining to discover high utility itemsets [5  L i u  et al then presented a two-phase algorithm for fast discovering high utility itemsets by adopting the downward-closure property [10 a n d na m e d hi s  approach as the transaction-weighted-utilization \(TWU model. Lin et al proposed a high utility pattern tree \(HUPtree\gorithm w h i c h e x t e nded fro m t h e F P gro w t h approach, to mine the high utility itemsets from a tight tree structure. It integrated the two-phase approach n d t h e  FP-tree concept t o e ffi ci ent l y a n d e ffe c t i v e l y fi nd hi gh utility patterns. As an example, the quantitative database in Table 1 is used to show how to construct the HUP tree. It consists of 10 transactions and 6 items, denoted A to F  TABLE I  T HE Q UANTITATIVE D ATABASE  TID A B C D E F 1 3 2 0 3 0 0 2 2 0 0 4 2 0 3 3 0 5 0 0 3 4 1 0 3 0 1 2 5 1 0 0 3 2 0 6 1 2 0 4 0 0 7 2 3 2 0 1 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 0 0 3 3 0 0 10 3 0 0 4 0 0  Assume the minimum high utility threshold is set at 35 Also assume that the predefined profit values for the items are defined in a utility table shown in Table 2 In the HUP mining algorithm, it first calculates the transaction utility of each transaction to find the high transaction-weighted 1-itemsets. The algorithm then keeps only the high transaction-weighted 1-itemsets in the transactions and sorts them according to their transaction frequencies. The updated transactions are then used to build the HUP tree tuple by tuple. For the above example, the high transaction-weighted 1-itemsets with their value are found as  A 2725 B 1540 D 2080 E 1483}, each of which has its transaction-weighted utilization larger than or equal to the minimum high utility value 1022.35. Each transaction in the quantitative database is then updated to remove the items which are not the high transaction-weighted 1-itemsets. After that, the updated transactions are used to construct the high utility pattern tree \(HUP tree\ tuple by tuple. The final results of the above example are then shown in Figure 2 TABLE II  T HE U TILITY T ABLE  Item Profit A 3 B 150 C 1 D 50 E 100 F 20    root  A:2728 D:1930 A B:962 Header_Table Item twu A 2728 D 2083 E 1483 B 1540 A D A 4 D 7 B 4 E:759 A 3 D 7 E 4 E:724 A 3 E 2 B:578 A 2 E 1 B 3 D:153 D 16 10 18 3  Figure 2  The final constructed HUP tree In the HUP tree, each node has to store the transactionweighted-utilization of the item as well as the quantities of its preceding items \(including itself\ in the path. An array called quan_Ary is then attached to a node to keep those values. After the final HUP-tree is constructed, the HUPgrowth mining approach is then executed to derive the high utility itemsets from the tree [11   III  T HE P ROPOSED I NCREMENTAL U PDATED HUP  M AINTENANCE A LGORITHM  To process the incrementally updated HUP \(abbreviated as iHUP\ maintenance algorithm, an HUP tree must be built in advance from the original quantitative database before new transactions come. When new transactions are inserted the proposed maintenance algorithm will then process them to maintain the HUP tree. The proposed approach first partitions the items into four parts according to whether they are high transaction-weighted \(indicated as large\ 1-itemsets or non-high transaction-weighted \(indicated as small\ 1itemsets in the original database and in the new transactions Each part is then processed by its own procedure. The Header_Table and the HUP tree are correspondingly updated whenever necessary. The details of the proposed iHUP maintenance algorithm are described below

If item i j satisfies the above condition, it will still be large after the database is updated; then update the value of i j in the Header_Table as S U  i j d add i j to the set of Insert_Items  Otherwise, item i j will become small after the database is updated; remove i j from the Header_Table and from the HUP tree, connect each parent node of i j  directly to the corresponding child node of i j and update its corresponding child node of i j in the path to remove i j of its attached array quan_Ary  STEP 7 For each item i j  which is large in the new transactions but small in the original database \(not appearing in the Header_Table\ the following substeps Case 3  Substep 7-1 Rescan the original database to find out each transaction utility of item i j in the original database, calculate the transactionweighted-utilization of item i j and set it as S D  i j  Substep 7-2 Set the updated transactionweighted utilization S U  i j f item i j in the entire updated database as S U  i j  S D  i j  S d  i j  Substep 7-3 Check whether the value S U  i j  item i j  satisfies the following condition     d t k D T k j U k k tu tu i S        where T k and t k mean the k th transaction in the original database and in the new transactions respectively. If item i j satisfies the above condition, it will be large after the database is updated; add item i j both in the set of Insert_Items  and in the set of Rescan_Items  STEP 8 Sort the items in the Rescan_Items in the descending order of their transaction frequencies f  i j and sequentially insert them with their S U  i j  values to the end of the Header_Table STEP 9 For each original transaction with an item i j  existing in the Rescan_Items do the following substeps Substep 9-1 If an item i j in the currently processed k th transaction has appeared at the 
306 


corresponding path of the HUP tree, add the transaction utility tu k calculated in Substep 7-1 to the node i j as its accumulated value. Besides add the quantities of the prefix items of i j to the corresponding elements of the quan_Ary array in the node, which stores the accumulated quantities of the prefix items of i j  Substep 9-2 Otherwise, add a node with i j to the end of the corresponding path and set the utility value tu k in the k th transaction as its value in the node. Besides, set the quantities of the prefix items of i j in the transaction to the corresponding elements of the array quan_Ary the node. At last, insert a link from the node of i j in the last branch to the current node. If there is no such branch, insert a link from the entry of i j in the Header_Table to the current node STEP 10 For each new transaction with an item i j existing in the Insert_Items do the following substeps Substep 10-1 If an item i j in the currently processed k th transaction has appeared at the corresponding path of the HUP tree, add the transaction utility tu k to the node with i j in the path as its accumulated value. Besides, add the quantities of the prefix items of i j to the corresponding elements of the quan_Ary array in the node, which stores the accumulated quantities of the prefix items of i j  Substep 10-2 Otherwise, add a node with i j to the end of the corresponding path and set the utility value tu k in the k th transaction as its value in the node. Besides, set the quantities of the prefix items of i j in the transaction to the corresponding elements of the array quan_Ary the node. At last, insert a link from the node of i j  in the last branch to the current node. If there is no such branch, insert a link from the entry of i j in the Header_Table to the current node  After STEP 10, the final updated HUP tree is then constructed. Note in STEP 9, a corresponding path means a path in the tree which corresponds to the items to be processed in a transaction according to the order of items appearing in the Header_Table. Besides, STEPs 9 and 10 can be simultaneously done in a database scan. Below, an example is given to illustrate the proposed iHUP maintenance algorithm when new transactions are inserted IV  A N E XAMPLE  In this session, an example is given to illustrate the proposed incrementally updated HUP \(iHUP\aintenance algorithm when new transactions are inserted. The original database and its already constructed HUP tree are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, respectively. Table 3 shows the new transactions to be inserted to the original database in Table 1 There are 5 new transactions. The items are the same as those in Table 1 TABLE III  F IVE N EW I NSERTED TRANSACTIONS  TID A B C D E F 11 3 0 4 8 0 0 12 3 0 3 7 0 0 13 3 0 2 6 0 0 14 1 0 0 0 1 1 15 4 3 0 0 0 0  Assume the minimum high utility threshold is also set at 35%. The minimum high utility value was calculated as 1022.35\. The utility value of each item occurring in each new transaction in Table 3 is calculated The transaction-weighted util izations of each item in the transactions are summed together. After that, all the items are then divided into four cases and are then processed in their individual ways. The final updated HUP tree is thus shown in Figure 3   root  A:4399 D:3016 A B:962 Header_Table Item twu A4399 D3169 B2002 C2037 A D A 4 D 7 B 4 B:1040 A 6 B 6 D:153 D 30 19 39 3 C:220 C:578 C:153 A 2 C 2 B 3 A 4 C 8 D 3 C 3 C:1086 A 9 D C 9 21  Figure 3  The final updated iHUP tree V  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  A real dataset called chess was used in the experiments 8 T h e v a lu es o f q u an tit y a n d u tilit y  w e re ass i g n ed to each  purchased item in the database. The range was set at from 1 to 20 for quantity, and from 1 to 200 for utility, respectively in uniform distribution. Experiments were then made to show the execution time of the batch HUP algorithm and the proposed iHUP maintenance algorithm, which included the tree-construction phase and the mining phase. The first 3,000 transactions were extracted from the chess database to construct an initial HUP-tree structure. The value of the minimum support thresholds were set at 70% to 90% for the two algorithms, with 5% increment each time. The next 1 of the first transactions, which was 30, was then used in incremental mining. The results for the execution time of the two algorithms are shown in Figure 4 From Figure 4, it is obvious to see that the proposed iHUP maintenance algorithm has a better performance than the batch HUP mining algorithm in five different minimum utility thresholds. Besides, the number of tree nodes for the HUP-tree and iHUP-tree is also compared. The results are shown in Figure 5 From Figure 5, it can be seen that the two algorithms generated nearly the same size of trees. The effectiveness of the iHUP maintenance algorithm is thus acceptable

The proposed approach can thus achieve a good trade-off between execution time and tree complexity R EFERENCES  1  R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
