However the latter represents the association rules more visual, vivid and concise than the former, therefor e, association rule mining on concept lattice is applied to find common relations among different knowledge clusters in computer education Keywords association rule;concept lattice; rough set;data mining I I NTRODUCTION  Association rule[1 m i ning is an im portant data m i ning method for determining consumer purchasing patterns in transaction databases. Nowadays, many applications have used to discover useful information Rough set is used extensively in the field of date mining or knowledge discovery in datab ases, which is firstly proposed by Z. Pawlak[3  now a days ha s become an useful tool for mining rules from decision tables then solves the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition eff ectively, while Galois \(Concept Lattice was presented by R. W relationships between objects, re presents knowledge shown with hierarchical structure on the Hasse diagram, thus it is properly applied to the description of mining association rules in databases, Literature  has testified that what rough set and concept lattice represent is isomorphic, despite their algebraic structures are not different As we known, association rules mining on rough set is predominant on data mining, which should deal with multistep attribute reduction that deleting the reduplicative rows or columns. However, attribute reduc tion[8 is not just only one set, usually, finding out all a ttribute reductions or the least attribute reduction has been testified that it is NP-Hard problems, in the meantime providing that all attribute reductions or the least attribut e reduction have been found association rule mining from the attribute reductions is a very difficult work because how to generate and express association rules are not very easy tasks In this paper, the contribut e is that association rule mining based on concept lattice can perform the same function as that of on rough set, but the latter represents the rules more visual, vivid and concise than the former The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we review the preliminaries of association rules, basic notions of concept lattice, then discuss the gener ation algorithm of concept lattice in section III, association rules mining on concept lattice is described in section IV, in addition, preliminaries of mining rules from decision tables on rough set are reviewed in section V, association rule mining on concept lattice and rough set are illustrated and the comparison between them is made in section VI, finally, we reach the conclusion in section VII II B ASIC NOTIONS OF ASSOCIATION RULE AND CONCEPT LATTICE  A Basic notions of association rule Mining association rule is an important branch of data mining, which describes potential relations among data items attribute, variant\in databases, The well-known Apriori algorithm was proposed by R. Ag rawal et.al., in 1993. Mining association rules can be stated as follows Let I={i 1 i 2 i m be a set of items. Let D, the taskrelevant data, be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items such that T 000 I. The quantities of items bought are not considered. Each transaction is assigned an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items, A transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A 000 T. An association rule is an implication of the form A 000 B, where A 000 I, B 000 I, and A 000 B 000 The rule A 000 B holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percen tage of transactions in D that contain A 000 B \(i.e., both A and B\. This is taken to be the probability, P\(A 000 B\The rule A 000 B has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the conditional probability, P\(B|A That is, Support \(A 000 A 000 B Confidence\(A 000 B\\(B|A\Support\(A 000 B\/Support \(A Mining association rules should be mining strong association rules that satisfy th e user-specified both minimum support threshold and confidence threshold This paper is supported by innovation program of shanghai municipal education commission under grant No. 08YZ120

B Basic notions of concept lattice A context is defined as a triple C=\(O,D,R 002 where O is a set of objects, D is a set of attributes, and R is the binary relation between O and D, accord ing to the inclusion relations between extents and intents, there is an unique ordered set that describes the structure of inherent lattice, which defines natural groupings and relationship desc riptions between the objects and their attributes in the contex t, this structure is also known as \(Galois\5 for short, CL Definition 2.1 Each pair such as \(A,B\rived from the context is called a concept, where A 000 P\(O 000 P\(D\, and P\(O P\(D\re the power sets of O and D respectively, A and B create a connection in terms of the following properties A’={m 000 D 000\005 g 000 A, gRm}, B’={g 000 O 000\005 g 000 B, gRm Where A’=B, B’=A. A is called the extent of concept and B is called the intent, deno C respectively Definition 2.2 In a CL, partial order relation “< ” between concept C 1 A 1 B 1 nd C 2 A 2 B 2 defined as C 1 C 2 000 B 2 000 B 1 then C 1 is the sub-concept \(son 2 and C 2  is the sup-concept \(father\C 1 that is, the relation between C 2 and C 1 is the relation as of father and son If C 1 C 2 there exists no a concept C=\(A,B\uch that satisfies C 1 C<C 2 C 1 C 2 is called a direct-sub-concept-directsup-concept-relation between C 1 and C 2 the Hasse diagram of concept lattice is generated according to the partial order relation: If C 1 C 2 is a direct-sub-concept-direct-sup-concept there exists an edge from C 2 to C 1  From the definitions, the hierarchical relations between the concepts are shown to us, which can be used as an efficient tool for data analysis and knowledge acquisition III G ENERATION ALGORITHM OF CONCEPT LATTICE  From above the discussion, we can obtain the algorithm to generate concept lattice, which should be inserted initial concepts \(corresponding to initial concepts\one by one, then adjust it, the algorithm is described as following Algorithm Insertion \(CL, C insert a concept into CL 000x A concept C=\(A,B e CL, if there   is an equivalent concept of C in the CL such that 000\007 C 1i  C 1i 000 C\merge the intent of C into the intent of C1i then finish the oper ation of insertion, that is Intent\(C 1i C 1i  000 Intent\(C 000x Else, on the assumption that C 0 is a direct-sup-concept of C, firstly insert C as a sub-concept of C 0 into the CL finish the operation in turn as follows Each C 1i C 1i C 0 C 1i C} connects C as a directsup-concept of C 1i in the same time, then we remove the connections between C 1i and C 0  Insert the concept C k 002 A k I k enerated when C intersects concepts into the CL, by the way the judgment of the equivalent relations of sup-concept and sub-concept  in the algorithm can be implemented Attribute set A={a 1 a 2 a n in the context \(O,D,R partial relation generated by attribute a i can be represented by O i1 v i1 O i2 v i2 O ik v ik where O ij v ij is an object set O ij of attribute a i whose value is v ij therefore, we can gain an array of initial concepts CL\(a i A i1 a i v i1 A i2 a i  v i2 A ik a i v ik by attribute a i  The generation algorithm of the CL:  Create-In-Attr\(CL is below 000x Initialization: Generate CL with the complete concept all\only two concepts 000x for i:=1 to n do for C i 001\031 C\(a i Insertion\(CL, C i  IV M INING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON CONCEPT LATTICE  As for concept C=\(A, B\ in a CL, we can introduce support\(B\/M of intent B to concept C, M is the sum of transactions in D, |A| is the extent cardinal of concept C Definition 4.1 If Support \(B is big than the support threshold, the concept C is called a frequent concept, where intent B of concept C is frequent items Theorem 4.1 Frequent items is corresponding to the intents of concepts lattice each other Theorem 4.2 If C=\(A, B\a concept in a concept lattice, the support of B is |A|/M, where |A is the extent cardinal of C, M is the sum of transactions in D. If B is frequent itemsets whose support is bigger than the support threshold, B must be a group of equivalent intents of the concepts According to the theorems mentioned above, association rules can be mined in a given concept lattice[16 Theorem 4.3  0017 If concepts C 1 A 1 B 1 C 2 A 2 B 2 isfy C 2 000 sup\(C 1 in association the rule: B 2  000 B 1 B 2 its confidence is |A 1 A 2 otherwise, B 1 B 2 000 B 2 its confidence is 100 0018 If concepts C 1 A 1 B 1  002 C 2 A 2 B 2 not satisfy C 2 000 sup\(C 1 nd there exists nonempty common maximumsub-concept C=\(A,B\namely 004 C’=\(A’,B’\ which makes C 000 sup\(C 001 C 1 000 sup\(C 001 C 2 000 sup\(C’\e, there are association rules between B 1 and B 2 B 1 000 B 2 B 2 000 B 1 their confidences are |A|/|A 1 A|/|A 2 respectivel V P RELIMINARIES OF MINING ASSOCIATION RULES FROM DECISION TABLES ON ROUGH SET  Decision table can be stated as follows DT=\(U,AT 004 d},f\ where U is a non-empty, finite set called the universe, U={u 1 u 2 u 3 u n elements of U are called objects, At is a non-empty, infinite set of attributes AT={c 1 c 2 c 3 c m which is a set of conditions, Vc i is the value of c i i=1,2 005 m,  d is the decision attribute, its value is V d f is information function f: U 001 Va  \(a 004 AT 005y d The key step of mining rules algorithm fr om decision table is to find out the dependence relationship between condition attributes AT and decision attributes d Definition 5.1 X 005 AT  if 000\005 u 0021 v 000 U 0021 there exist 0021 000o 0021 v

Where “X\(u\\(v\” denote the 000\005 a 000 X, satisfying v\ is u and v have the same value of attribute a  000o is the implication function, then decision attribute “d” is dependent of condition attribut e subset X, denoted as X 000 d From the definitions, we can reach the conclusion: If we find out those condition attribute sets X, whose the object of v\e same object of the v e certain or uncertain rules can be mined[9  VI C OMPARISON OF MINING ASSOCIATION RULES BETWEEN CONCEPT LATTICE AND ROUGH SET  There is a decision table as shown in the decision table 1 attribute a, b, c are condition attributes, where the condition attribute a is divided in two classes {a 1 low 2 high as the condition attribute b and c, the condition attribute b is divided in three  classes {b 1 black 2 red\ b 3 yellow the condition attribute c is divided in two classes {c 1 blue c 2 brown\sion attribute, and decision attribute d is divided into two classes {d 1 d 2  We can mine rules from the decision table 1 n g rough set, taking the condition attribute b as an example  U/b={X 1 X 2 X 3 1, 2, 3},{4},{5, 6 U/d={Y 1 Y 2 1, 2, 3, 6}, {4, 5}}, according to the attribute reduction ,then the ce rtain rules can be mined If hair=”b 1 black\ then the class=”d 1 that is b 1 black 000 d 1  If hair=”b 2 red\n the class=”d 2 that is b 2 red 000 d 2  the confidence of the two rules is 100 X 3 004 Y 1 6}, X 3 004 Y 2 5}, the uncertain rules can be mined If hair=”b 3 yellow\n the class=”d 1 or the class=”d 2  that is: b 3 yellow 000 d 1   whose confidence of the two rules is 50 If hair=” b 3 yellow\ then the class=”d 1 or the class=”d 2 that is: b 3 yellow 000 d 1   whose confidence of the two rules is 50 According to the data in the decision table 1, the concept lattice can be built against the alg orithm in section 3, and the Hasse diagram corresponding to the concept lattice has been drawn as Fig 1, on the concept lattice we can mine the association rules, just as A priori algorithm As for the same example above, the rule b 1 black 000 d 1  has mined based on rough set In Fig.1, the support of frequent itemsets is not divided by M=6 in order to be convenient for explanation, we can easily obtain frequent itemsets, for example, such as the support of frequent itemsets b 1 d 1 is the extent cardinal of concept\({1,2,3},{b 1 d 1 is 3 but frequent itemsets {b 1 does not exist, there is an common maximum-sub-concept {b 1 d 1 whose support is 3, then the confidence of the rule b 1 black 000 d 1 is 3/3=100 However, there exist some uncertain rules, the rules b 3 yellow 000 d 1 mined in the decision table 1 based on rough set the support of itemsets {b 3 is the extent cardinal of concept\({5,6},{b 3 is 2, but the itemsets {b 3 d 1 does not exist there is a common maximum-sub-concept\({5},{a 2 b 3 c 2 d 1  whose support is the extent card inal is 1, then the confidence of the rules b 3 yellow 000 d 1 is 1/2=50%, Finally, it is tested that the results are identified                          VII C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, from the comp arison of association rules mining based on between rough set and concept lattice, we can obtain the conclusion that th ey perform the same function however, in the course of association rules mining, the latter represents the rules more visual, vivid and concise than the former. The approach of mining association rules based on concept lattice presents association rules more visual, vivid and concise than that of on rough set In view of finding out all attr ibute reductions or the least attribute reduction has been testified that it is NP-Hard problems, in the meantime providing that all attribute reductions or the least attribut e reduction have been found mining association rules from the attribute reductions is a very difficult work because how to generate and express association rules are not very easy tasks, in addition. Since frequent itemsets and their supports are shown on the Hasse diagram of Tab. 1  Decision Table U a\(High b\(hair c\(eyes d\(class 1 a 1 low 1 black 1 blue 1  2 a 2 high\ b 1 black 1 blue 1  3 a 2 high\ b 1 black 2 brown 1  4 a 2 high\ b 2 red\ c 1 blue 2  5 a 1 low 3 yellow 1 blue 2  6 a 2 high\ b 3 yellow 2 brown 1  Fig 1 The  Hasse diagram of concept lattice according to Tab. 1

Moreover we can say that F C is comparable to E C and the modi\002ed version of E C i.e vE C  is correct and effective  The combinations of F C  E C  and vE C with 006 conf improve slightly F C  E C  vE C  and 006 conf  We can say that the sum of con\002dences is an important measure and these combined measures are useful in particular in the context where the accuracies of the classi\002cation by the sum of con\002dence by F C  and by E C are almost very good For conclusions 002rstly the adapted weight of evidence is a good class membership measure built on the gain of information F C  a measure built on the revisited 037 2 test provides another view of information gain It is comparable to the adapted weight of evidence The sum of con\002dence is a simple and natural measure with the good performance The combinations of the sum of con\002dence with the previous measures are interesting and useful to improve their performance Next based on the average accuracy values of different measures we recommend to use the combined measures because the average accuracy values of the combined measures are in general better than that of the non-combined measures Finally through the results on each dataset between the combined measures based on 037 2 and the weight of evidence we suggest the following propositions 017 For the 13 small datasets though the average accuracy value of cE C is slightly better than that of cF C  we can observe that cF C is much often wins cE C  Indeed cE C wins cF C on only 3 datasets while cF C wins cE C on 6 datasets Hence we can recommend cF C for the small datasets 017 For the 10 large datasets the average accuracy value of cvE C is slightly better than that of cF C  and cvE C wins cF C on 4 datasets and cF C wins cvE C 3 datasets Hence we can recommend cvE C for large datasets References  B Lent A Sw ami and J W idom Clustering association rules Proc Intl Conf on Data Engineering ICDE'97 IEEE Computer Society 1997 pp 220-231  W  Li J Han and J Pei CMAR Accurate and Ef 002cient Classi\002cation based on multiple class-association rules Proc IEEE Intl Conf on Data Mining ICDM'01 San Jose CA IEEE Computer Society 2001 pp 369-376  B Liu W  Hsu and Y  Ma Inte grating Classi\002cation and Association Rule Mining Proc 4th Intl Conf on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD'98 AAAI Press 1998 pp 80-86  Y  Sun Y  W ang and A.K.C W ong Boosting an Association Classi\002er in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 18 no 7 IEEE Computer Society 2006 pp 988-992  J W ang and G Karypis HARMONY  Ef 002ciently Mining the Best Rules for Classi\002cation Proc SIAM Intl Conf on Data Mining SDM'05 2005 pp 205-216  J W ang and G Karypis On Mining Instance-Centric Classi\002cation Rules in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 18 no 11 2006 pp 1497-1511  Y  W ang and A.K.C W ong From Association to Classi\002cation Inference using Weight of Evidence in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 15 no 3 2003 pp 764-767  F  Coenen The LUCS-KDD Implementations of the FOIL PRM and CPAR algorithms http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk frans/KDD/Software/FOIL PRM CPAR/foilPrmCpar.html Computer Science Department University of Liverpool UK 2004  Y  Basti de R T aouil N P asquier  G Stumme and L Lakhal Mining Frequent Patterns with Counting Inferences in ACM SIGMOD Explorations vol 2 no 2 2000 pp 66-75  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules Proc 20th Intl Conf on Very Large Databases VLDB'94 Santiago Chile 1994 pp 487-499  V  Phan-Luong and R Messouci Building Classi\002ers with Association Rules based on Small Key Itemsets Proc 2nd IEEE International Conf on Digital Information Management ICDIM'07 France 2007 pp 200-205  J Quinlan and R Cameron-Jones FOIL A Midterm Report Proc European Conf on Machine Learning ECML'93 1993 pp 3-20  X Y in and J Han CP AR Classi\002cation based on Predicti v e Association Rules Proc 3rd SIAM Intl Conf on Data Mining SDM'03 San Francisco CA SIAM 2003 pp 369-376  C Cortes and V  V apnik Support-V ector Netw orks  in Machine Learning vol 20 no 3 1995 pp 273-297

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnt create sound clips  A5.1 We dont need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIs   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
