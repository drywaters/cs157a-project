A Boolean Matrix based approach has been employed to discover frequent itemsets  the items forming a rule come from different dimensions. It is an algorithm for mining multidimensional association rules from relational databases. The algorithm adopts Boolean relational calculus to discover frequent predicate sets. When using this algorithm first time, it scans the database once and will generate the association rules. Apriori property is used in algorithm to prune the item sets. It is not necessary to scan the database again it uses Boolean logical operations to generate the association rules Keywords Boolean matrix, multidimensional association rules frequent itemsets, relational calculus I   I NTRODUCTION  Data mining is the analysis of typically very large sets of data in order to discover yet unknown relationships among the data and aggregates them in ways which are novel, useful and understandable to the users of the data. Association rule mining finds interesting association or correlation relationship among a large data set of items  An association rule is generally in the format A 000 B  where A and B These are two distinct sets of items, i.e 002  003 B A  A set of items is called an itemset A set of k items is called a k-itemset The main aim of association rule is to find associations among items from a set of transactions, each of which contains a set of items. Generally the algorithm finds a subset of association rules that satisfy certain measures. The most commonly used measures of association rules are  Support and Confidence  Support The support of rule A 000 B is defined as percentage of transactions including both A and B  A 004 B transaction sets. It can be denoted as N B A P Support    B  A  004  000  Confidence Confidence of rule A 000 B is defined as percentage of transactions including both A and B A 004 B  transactions that contain A It can be denoted as       A P B A P B A Confidence 004  000  An itemset with a support greater than a given minimum support is called frequent itemset  Support determines how often a rule is applicable to a given dataset, while confidence  determines how frequently items in B appear in transactions that contain A  Most association rule algorithms generate association rules in two steps 1  Generate all frequent itemsets, and \(2\nstruct all rules using these itemsets The basis of such algorithm is the fact that any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent, and both A  and B in rule must also be frequent. Thus, every frequent itemset of size n can result in n association rules with a single item. The first step is expensive in terms of computation, memory usage and I/O resources. Much of the efforts in association rule discovery have been given to improve the efficiency of this first step. The second step is relatively straightforward, but it can also be very expensive when solving real-world problems The discovery of interesting association rules is useful in decision making process. Association rules are usually used to study the relevancy among the different items or attributes Association rule, which describes correlations of data items in large numbers of data, is a manner of expressing knowledge The first algorithm namely Apriori algorithm w a s propos ed by R. Agrawal and others   Association rules can be classified as single-dimensional association rules and multidimensional association rules on the basis of dimensions appearing in rules In multidimensional databases, we refer to each distinct predicate in a rule as a dimension. Hence, we can refer to buys \(X Digital camera 000  buys \(X, ìHP Printer is a single dimensional or intra-dimensional association rule because it contains a single distinct predicate \(e.g buys ith multiple occurrences \(i.e., the predicate occurs more than once within the rule\Association rules that involve two or more dimensions or predicates can be referred to as multidimensional association rules age\(X , "20 005 occupation \(X , "student 000  buys \(X , "laptop  contains three predicates age, occupation and buys of which occurs only once in the rule. Hence, we say that it has no repeated predicates. Multidimensional association rules with no repeated predicates are called inter-dimensional association rules. We can also mine multidimensional

association rules with repeated predicates, which contain multiple occurrences of some predicates. These rules are called hybrid-dimensional association rules. This  paper discusses mining multidimensional inter-dimension association  rules directly in relational database [15   To mine association rules in relational database, some authors present a method which transforms relational database into transaction database and uses Apriori algorithm to mine rules But the performance of the Apriori  algorithm is not very good. The frequently used methods of m i n i n g  multidimensional association rules with relational database are those which improve the classical algorithms such as , Apriori and other apriori like using SQL tools   T h es e  algorithms are fast and effective to a certain extent, so they are used in many applications. However, they are not appropriate for mining the same database again and again to acquire more interesting rules than last time, because they cost as much time as last time. To find a solution to this problem, this paper presents a new algorithm that uses Boolean matrix and logical operations on attributes and items  II  DEFINITIONS  A  Association Rules Definition 1 Let I = {i 1 i 2 i 3 i n be a set of items. D is a database of transactions.  Each transaction T is a set of items and has an identifier called TID. Each T 006   Definition 2  Association rule is the implication of the form A 000 B where A and B are itemsets which satisfies A 006 I B 006 I and A 003  B 002  Definition 3  The strength of an association rule can be measured in terms of its Support and Confidence   Rule A 000 B is true in D with a support \(denoted by sup d a confidence \(denoted by conf here A and B are  set of items. Support sup is a percentage of transactions including both A and B  A 004 B transaction sets D Confidence  conf is a percentage of transactions including both A and B  A 004 B transactions that contain A   sup  P  A 004 B D   conf  P  B 005 A  9 P  A 004 B A B  Apriori Property If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent. Apriori is the first association rule mining algorithm for mining single dimension single level  boolean  association rules, which uses support based pruning to systematically control the exponential growth of candidate itemsets [6 C  Item sets in Multidimensional data set Let RD is relational database with m records and n dimensions. Dimensions, which are also called predications or fields, constitute a dimension combination with a formula d 1  d 2  d n which d j represents j th dimension. The i th record can be expressed as value combination with a formula  v i 1  v i 2  v in here v ij represents j th value in i th record 1 007 i 007 m and 1 007 j 007 n  Definition 4 The form d j  v ij an ìitemî in relational database or other multidimensional data sets, which is denoted by I ij That is I ij  d j  v ij here 1 007 i 007 m and 1 007 j 007 n    Definition 5 Suppose that A and B are items in the same relational database RD  A equals B if and only if the dimension and the value of the item A are equal to the dimension and the value of the item B which is denoted by A  B If it is not true that A equals B it is denoted by A 010 B    Definition 6 A set constituted by some ìitemî defined in definition 4 is called ìitemsetî. The ìitemsetî which are constituted by all items in relational database is called ìFull itemsetî, and it is denoted by S That is S 9  I ij  1 007 i 007 m and 1 007 j 007 n   Definition 7 Boolean Matrix: is a matrix with element ë0í or 1  Definition 8 The Boolean AND operation is defined as follows 0.0=0 0.1=0 1.0=0 1.1=1 Where logical implication is denoted by . or AND. If we write C=A.B,  then C can be determined by listing all possible combinations of A and B. Truth  table for logical AND will be   TABLE  I   A ND OPERATION  A B C=A.B 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1  Definition 9  The Boolean ëAND calculusí is carried out to an arbitrary k columns vector of the Boolean matrix; the sum of 1í of the operation result is called k- support of the k columns vector  Proposition 1  If the sum of ë1í in a column vector A i is less than min_sup_num, it is not necessary that A i will attend calculus of the next level supports  Rationale  According to the principle of the Boolean AND calculus, the result is ë1í when th e value of all vector elements in a record\s ë1í [7   Proposition 2  Itemset A is a k-itemsets \(each item belongs to different dimension/attribute\ |L K-1 j\ presents the number of values in a dimension/attribute ëjí in all frequent  \(k-1 itemsets of the frequent set L K-1 There is an item j in X. If L K-1 j\| is smaller than k-1, itemset X is not a frequent itemset

Proposition 3  L K presents the number of k-predicate set  in the frequent set L K If |L K is smaller than k+1, the maximum length of frequent predicate sets is k  Rationale  Frequent k+1\temsets X have k+1 frequent k-subsets. If the number of frequent k-itemsets in the frequent set L K is smaller than k+1, there are no frequent \(k+1\temsets in the mined transaction database  III  ALGORITHM  Let RD be a relational database, m be the number of records and n are number of dimensions, and min_sup is the minimum support of RD. The minimum support number min_sup_num  can be defined as min_sup_num= min_sup   m The algorithm consists of following steps 1  Transforming the relational database in Boolean matrix 2  Generating the set of frequent 1-itemset L 1  3  Pruning the Boolean matrix 4  Perform AND operation on frequent 1-items of different dimensions to generate 2-itemsets 5  Repeat the process to generate \(k+1\itemsets from L k  A  Transforming the relational database into Boolean Matrix The relational database RD has m records and n  dimensions/attributes. Whereas each dimension has different value combinations or categories. To extract such patterns from relational database, the categorical and symmetric binary attributes are transformed into ìitemsî [7 h is t y p e o f  transformation can be performed by creating a new item for each distinct attribute-value pair. Then association rule mining algorithm can be applied.  If th ere are k value combinations in a dimension then k\(k-1\2 binary items will be created. We set up a Boolean matrix A m*n  which has m are records\ rows and n are different dimension categories\ columns. For each record, only one category of each dimension contains the value 1 rest will contain 0 B  Generating the frequent 1-itemset L 1  The Boolean matrix A m*n is scanned and support numbers of all dimension categories are computed.  The Support number sup_numë of I j is the number of ë1sí in the j th column of the Boolean matrix A m*n If sup_num of I j is less than min_sup_num, then itemset I j is not a frequent  1-itemset and the j th column will be deleted from A m*n Otherwise itemset I j is the frequent 1-itemset and is added to frequent one itemset list L 1  C  Prunung the Boolean Matrix P runing the Boolean matrix means deleting some columns from it. Columns of the Boolean matrix are pruned according to the Proposition 2 This is described in detail as: Let D is the set of all dimensions/attributes in the frequent set   L K-1 where k>2. Compute all |L K-1 j\ere  j 011 IÅ, and delete the column of corresponding item j if |L K-1 j\| is smaller than  min_sup  D  Generating the set of frequent k-itemsets L k  Frequent candidate k-itemsets are discovered only by AND relational calculus, which is carried out for the k-vectors combination. If the Boolean matrix A p*q has q columns where 2 000T n and min_sup_num is 000K  000S m, \(C q  k  combinations of kvectors will be produced. The AND relational calculus computed is for each combination of k-vectors. If the sum of element values in the ëANDí calculation result is not less than the minimum support number min_supt_num the k-itemsets corresponding to this combination of k-vectors are the frequent k-itemsets and are added to the set of frequent kitemsets list L k     IV  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE  An example is given in TABLE II. and the data used in the example is from a relational table shown in  TABLE II. The minimum support for TABLE II is 0.5; m=8 is the number of transactions. Therefore min_sup_num=8  0.5=4  TABLE II    A RELATIONAL TABLE RT   RID M N O P Q R1 M1 N1 O1 P1 Q1 R2 M2 N2 O1 P2 Q1 R3 M2 N2 O2 P2 Q1 R4 M1 N1 O2 P1 Q1 R5 M2 N3 O2 P1 Q2 R6 M1 N1 O1 P1 Q1 R7 M2 N3 O2 P1 Q2 R8 M2 N2 O1 P2 Q1  1  The relational table RT is transformed into Boolean Matrix A m*n as given below  M          N          O           P             Q  000P 000P 000P\000P 000P  M1 M2  N1  N2  N3 O1 O2 P1 P2 Q1 Q2 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1   Figure 1. A 8*11   2  Compute  the sum of the elements value of each column in the Boolean matrix A 8*11 and set of frequent 1-itemset is L 1 M2},{O1},{O2},{P1},{Q1  The M1, N1, N2, N3, P2, Q2 columns of the boolean matrix A 8*11 are deleted because their support numbers are smaller than the minimum support number R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8

3  Now perform the ëANDí operation to generate 2itemsets on these frequent 1-items of different dimensions 4  The candidate 2-itemsets from different dimensions are P,P1 P,Q1 Q,Q1 5  After performing ëANDí operation for the above interdimensional item combinations, we get the support numbers of all the2-itemsets mentioned above 6  The Boolean matrix A 8*9 is generated   M2.O1  M2.O2  M2.P1  M2.Q1 O1.P1  O1.Q1 O2.P1 O2.Q1  P1.Q1  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0   Figure 2. A 8*9   7  Compute the sum of all column elements of Boolean matrix A 8*9 8  Then compare them with min_sup_num, only  the 6 th  column of A 8*9 O1Q1\ greater  9  Thus the only frequent 2-itemset is \(O1Q1\. The algorithm will terminate here because there is no other frequent 2-itemset in the  list L 2 for generating higher itemsets  V  THEORITICAL ANALYSIS  Suppose that  relational database RD has m number of records and number of dimension is n\(n<<m the number of different values of j-dimension is |V j and the maximum number of items in one of all frequent item sets is K. Frequent  j-itemsets  has |D j different dimension combinations. There are |L j  frequent j item sets and |C j candidate j-itemsets. The execution/processing time of the algorithm is divided into following parts First part is the time of generating candiadate 1-itemset :for each data e\(totally n.m data\ime consuming is O n∑m  V s   where V s equals to max V 1  V 2  V N  The second part is the time of performing AND operations on two frequent k 1\itemset into a k itemset O k  k 2   L k 1 2m Because the first item is much smaller compared with latter two items in the formula, the former formulas can have processing time  O k 2   L k 1 2 m pecially, processing time  in this part will be O M  k 2 The third part is the time of generating frequent k itemset with candidate k itemset: O C k So, the total processing time when using the algorithm for the first time should be O\(\(n.m.|V s     2     2  2 2 k k k k C m L k    000     Processing  time taken by algorithm after minimum support is adjusted should be O\(|C 1    2     2  2 2 k k k k C m L k    000    VI  EXPERIMENTS  To test whether the proposed method is fast, expansible and effective our experiments are made on machine with Intell \( R Core 2Duo, 1.5GHz and 1GB memory. The operating system is Windows XP .The database used has 500 records and 11 fields, which have 2~10 different values/categories   Figure 3. Execution Time with different record numbers \(3-dimensions  VII  CONCLUSION  In this paper, a multidimensional association rule mining algorithm based on Boolean matrix is proposed. The main features of the algorithm are that it scans the database only once, it does not generate the candidate item sets, and it uses the Boolean vector ìrelational calculusî to generate frequent item sets. It stores all data in the form of bits, so it needs less memory space and can be applied to large relational databases R EFERENCES  1 A g ra w a l R, Lm ie linsk i T  Sw a m i A   M ining A ssoc ia tion R u le s between Sets of Items in Large Databaseî, Proceeding of the ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data, Washington, USA pp. 207-216, 1993 2 A g ra wa l R, Srik a n t R Fa st A l g o rithm s f o r Mining A ssoc i a tion  Rulesî, Proceeding of the 20 th International Conference on Very Large Databases, Santiago, Chile, pp. 487-499, 1994 3 R.

IV C ONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK This position paper has shown a novel proposal for the detection of malicious attack injections in user-based recommendation systems A core step in this process consists in mining infrequent combinations of user ratings on items e.g movies books music and so on With this purpose we have introduced a variation of our previous algorithm G3PARM that is specially devoted to rare association rule mining Since G3PARM is an evolutionary algorithm that uses G3P we have taken advantage of some important characteristics aforementioned such as its adaptability to the scope of application as well as its scalability which allows it to face up to large datasets comprising a great deal of attributes or items Precisely this latter point is an usual shortcoming of current attack detection proposals The attack probability   and the 015\012 measure used in the analysis of the rating patterns allows us to extract the suspicious attacked items state the real inuence of these items and nally extract the target item that the attacker promoted In our experiments both the attacked items and some ller items were catalogued as suspicious but the ller items are discarded later thanks to the inuence measure As a future work we plan to test different types of attacks because CRD are susceptible to a wide range of attacks In this respect we will be able to prove our new detection process in more complex attack injections like the bandwagon attack Although most of the current proposals analyzed datasets with attacks we also propose to explore how this method would react in non-simulated environments i.e where the increment of the dataset presents both usual rating proles and attacker proles A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been supported by Spanish Research Projects P08-TIC-3720 TIN2008-06681-C06-03 and FEDER founds R EFERENCES  F  Zhang L Bai and F  Gao AU s er Tru s t-Ba s ed C o ll aborative Fi l terin g Recommendation A lg orithm  2009 pp 411ñ424  C W illiams B Mobasher  R  B urk e and R  Bhaumik D etectin g Pro l e Injection Attack s in C o ll aborative Fi l terin g A Cl a ss iﬁcation-Ba s ed Approach  2007 pp 167ñ186  C W illiams B Mobasher  a nd R Burk e Defending Recommender Systems Detection of Prole Injection Attacks Service Oriented C omputin g and App l ication s  vol 1 no 3 pp 157ñ170 2007  S X W u and W  Banzhaf The use of computational intelligence in intrusion detection systems A review App l ied Soft C omputin g  vol 10 no 1 pp 1ñ35 2010  B Mobasher  R  B urk e R Bhaumik and C  W illiams T o w ard T rustworthy Recommender Systems An Analysis of Attack Models and Algorithm Robustness A C MTran s  Internet Techno l   vol 7 no 4 p 23 2007  V  Chandola A Banerjee and V  K umar   Anomaly Detection A Survey A C M C omput Surv  vol 41 no 3 pp 1ñ58 2009  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A N Sw ami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases in Proceedin gs of the 1993 A C M SIGMO D Internationa lC onference on Mana g ement of D ata SIGMO D 93  Washington D.C 1993 pp 207ñ216  C Bor gelt Ef cient Implementations of Apriori and Eclat  i n 1 s t Work s hop on Frequent Item s et Minin g Imp l ementation s FIMI’03  Melbourne Florida USA 2003  F  Bodon A T i re-based APRIORI Implementation for Mining Frequent Item Sequences in 1 s t Internationa l Work s hop on Open Source D ata Minin g  Frequent Pattern Minin g Imp l ementation  2005 pp 56ñ65  J Han J Pei Y  Y i n and R Mao Mining Frequent P atterns without Candidate Generation A Frequent-Pattern Tree Approach D ata Minin g and Know l ed g e D i s cover y  vol 8 pp 53ñ87 2004  J M Luna J R Romero and S V entura G3P ARM A Grammar Guided Genetic Programming Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in IEEE Wor l d C on g re ss on C omputationa l Inte ll i g ence W CC I 2010  Barcelona Spain 2010 pp 2586ñ2593  Y  K o h a nd N Rountree Findin g Sporadic Ru l e s U s in g Apriori-Inver s e  2005 pp 97ñ106  L Szathmary  A  N apoli and P  V altche v  T o w ards Rare Itemset Mining in 19th IEEE Internationa lC onference on Too ls with Artiﬁcia l Inte ll i g ence I C TAI 07  vol 1 2007 pp 305ñ312  L T r oiano G Scibelli and C Birtolo  A Fast Algorithm for Mining Rare Itemsets in Proceedin gs of the Ninth Int l  C onference on Inte ll ig ent S ys tem sD e s i g n and App l ication s  2009 pp 1149ñ1155  J R K o za Genetic Pro g rammin g  On the Pro g rammin g of C omputer s b y Mean s of Natura l Se l ection  C omp l ex Adaptive S ys tem s  TheMIT Press December 1992  S V e ntura C Romero A Zafra J Delgado and C Herv  as J C LE C  a Framework for Evo l utionar yC omputation  ser Soft Computing Springer Berlin  Heidelberg 2007 vol 12 pp 381ñ392  S Lam and J  Riedl Shilling recommender systems for fun and prot  in Proceedin gs of the 13th Internationa l WWW C onference NewYork NY 2004 688 20 1 0 1 0 t h I nt er nati o na lCo nf ere n ce o n I nt ell i ge nt S ys t e m sDes i g nan dA pp l i c ati o n s

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
