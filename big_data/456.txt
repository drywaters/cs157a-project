 email: shuyaota@aoni.waseda.jp  Abstract 227The neutron production from galactic cosmic ray GCR\ protons and alpha particles in the lunar subsurface was estimated using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation code PHITS. The PHITS simulations of equilibrium neutron density profiles in the lunar subsurface were compared with experimental data by the Apollo 17 Lunar Neutron Probe Experiment. By use of the latest GCR spectra based on BESS measurements and wellbenchmarked nuclear interaction models, our calculations well reproduced the data within the experimental error of 15% \(measurement\30% \(systematic\ region shallower than 300 g/cm 
2 However, our calculation showed 10-20% higher values in the deeper region 1  2   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  S IMULATION P ROCEDURE 1  3  I MPROVEMENT OF C ALCULATION C ONDITION 2

material with external particles, such as galactic cosmic rays GCRs\lar energetic particles \(SEPs\d anomalous cosmic rays. Since the Moon has no atmosphere and no magnetic field, the lunar surface is almost directly exposed to the external particles Energetic secondary particles produced by the nuclear inte raction, which are mainly protons, neutrons, and pions, become the source particles for subsequent productions of those particles   1 978-1-4244-3888-4/10/$25.00 \2512010 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper#1248, Version 4, Updated 2009:11:02 Accurate knowledge of the production rates of those secondary particles in the lunar subsurface is quite essential 
fo r resea r c h o n the M o o n F o r instance, observations of the gamma rays and neutrons from the lunar subsurface have been performed for the m easurements of chemical composition of the Moon by lunar orbiters such as Lunar Prospector [1 an d  KA GUYA 2  In th e d a ta an alysis o f  those gamma rays and neutron spectra, the simulation of production rates is essentially indispensable in order to improve the precision. Also, neutrons and gamma rays from the lunar surface become the sources of radiation to personnel who will take part of the future planned manned missions to the Moon. Therefore, precise simulations of production rates of the secondary particles are essential to protect human beings from radiation hazards [3   
 Thus, over the last four decades, precise estimations of the secondary products have been a long-standing problem in lunar science and when estimating the radiation environment on the Moon. In this work, we have simulated the neutron production in the lunar subsurface from the GCR protons and alpha particles since the neutrons play an essential role in the subsequent production of protons neutrons, gamma-rays, etc. So far, we have reported how the accuracies of the GCR energy spectra and nuclear interaction models for proton-induced reactions are specifically influential factors for the precise calculation of the neutron environment in th e lunar subsurface s  paper presents the new calculation results of neutron 
productions by improving those factors  2  S IMULATION P ROCEDURE  PHITS The simulation was carried out with the three-dimensional Monte Carlo particle and heavy ion transport code, PHITS 5  It h a s sever a l nu cl ear i n t e ract i on m odel s f o r  calculating not only nucleon-induced interactions but also nucleus-induced ones. The main sources of neutron produced in the lunar subsurface are the interaction of protons and alpha particles in the GCRs with the materials in the lunar subsurface. PHITS is therefore very suitable for

A descriptio n of the nuclear interaction models included in PHITS can be found in our previous paper [4  In t h i s w o r k  t h e versi on o f P H I T S 2 1 3 a n d t h e  latest one of PHITS 2.15 were used. Since JQMD \(JAERI Quantum Molecular Dynamics\ich is the nuclear interaction model in PHITS, was drastically improved in the version of PHITS 2.15 [8 e  u s ed t h is latest on e for  comparison with PHITS 2.13 used in our previous calculation [4  Lunar Neutron Probe Experiment \(LNPE For verification of our calculation, we chose the experimental data by the Lunar Neutron Probe Experiment LNPE\. The LNPE measured the neutron density profile in the lunar subsurface on one of the Apollo \(AP\missions 9 In th e ex perim en t eq u ilib ri u m n eu t rons with in th e first 2 m were measured by the 10 B \(n  002 Li reaction using cellulose triacetate \(Triafol TN\plastic detectors with 10 B targets. Total of 23 detectors were attached on a two-meterlong rod. Then the rod was inserted into a drilled hole created in the lunar subsurface. Measurements were then carried out for 49 hours. From this experiment, the neutron densities as a function of the depth from the lunar surface neutron density profile\were given with the experimental error of 15% \(measurement\30% \(systematic\he systematic error was caused fr om the different criteria in nuclear track recognition dependent on the observers. In this paper, we aimed to reproduce the LNPE results in our simulations  Geometry and material The simulation procedure basically follows the condition at which LNPE was performed in 1973. A sphere with a radius of 1738 km \(the same as the moon\s made as the target Then, three concentric spheres were configured inside the lunar sphere to differentiate the materials and densities depending on the depth from the surface. The materials and densities in the lunar body were set from data given by McKinney et al. [10 wh ich w e r e b a sed on d a ta b y  t h e So i l  Mechanics experiment which performed during one of the AP17 missions [1  As t h e beam so u r ce a shel l wi t h t h e  radius of 1738 + 0.001 km was configured outside the lunar sphere. Protons and alpha particles were used as the source particles from the GCR. Thes e particles were generated randomly on the shell and transported inwardly with cosine distribution to reproduce the isotropic GCR in space inside the shell. One can see the ge ometry of our simulation in more details in the paper by Ota et al. [4   3  I MPROVEMENT OF CALCULATION CONDITIONS  Galactic cosmic ray spectra The simulation results of neutron production in the lunar subsurface are very depending on which GCR spectrum is used [4 The r ef ore we ca r e ful l y st udi e d t h e f o rm ul a of  GCR protons and alpha spectra to agree with the latest observed data by e.g., BESS  A f o r m of anal y t i cal functions for the GCR energy spectra has been widely accepted in varying the parameters as a following equation  003  Z  A  m p c 2 and are the GCR flux particle/\(MeV/n\/cm 2 sec\he normali zation factor, the

Finally, we chose the spectra with parameter values based on the BESS data given by Hayatsu et al. [3 T h e val u es of pa ram e ters base d on E q   1 C  a  b and are shown together with the previous ones in Table 1. We have confirmed that the proton and alpha particle spectra when using these parameters showed also good agreement with other latest observational data by AMS and CAPRICE [13, 14 I n Fi g 1  GC R pr ot on a n d  alpha spectra largely dependent on various solar modulation parameters are shown together with the BESS data  Since 003 during LNPE was estimated to be 600 MV, we have chosen to use it in our calculation [1  Ho w e ver i t has bee n  suggested by Myers et al the  003 given by BESS has uncertainties. For instance, they suggested the 003 in 1998 is 600 \261 100 MV. Similarly, we used the GCR proton and alpha spectra during LNPE as 003 600 \261 100 MV. In Fig. 2 those spectra used in our simu lations are shown. Differences in total number of fluxes of proton and alpha particle between the spectra used in this work and the previous work are shown in the Table 2. The total numbers of fluxes were obtained by integration of the proton and alpha particle spectra, respectively. They are in creased by a factor of 1.29 and 1.75 for proton and alpha particles compared to the previous one when using the new GCR spectra  The neutron density profile was calculated using those spectra with the energies from 0.01 to 100 GeV/n. 100, 000 and 25,000 source particles were used for protons and alpha particles in each run. The statistical error was estimated to be less than 1%. It should be emphasized that our calculation does not include neutron production from any SEP component and anomalous cosmic rays. However according to McKinney et al there is no indication of heightened solar activity during the Apollo 17 mission, and normal solar activity produces an ineffectual proton spectrum E 10 MeV\for subsurface neutron production 10  Th erefo r e, it is enou gh to sim u late th e LNPE resu lts from the GCR proton and alpha particles  Table 1.

The standard deviations of the ratios range up to 44% at maximum in JAM at 3 GeV. Therefore the more comparisons using the more experimental data for the better statistics are required to judge the best protonnucleus reaction model, but our results indicate that the Cugnon Old E 3 GeV\ and the JAM E 3 GeV\ models in PHITS 2.13 can reproduce the data better than the other models

Therefore, similar simulation but employing JENDL-HE instead of nuclear interaction models was also performed in order to determine the dependence of the neutron production on the nuclear interaction model  As well as the nuclear interaction models, we benchmarked the JENDL-HE with the experimental data by Ishibashi et al The results of double differential neutron production cross sections for protons on Al at 0.8, 1.5, and 3 GeV are shown in Fig. 5. These cross sections were directly extracted from the JENDL-HE. In Fig. 6, we show the average ratios of calculated cross section to the experimental data in the same way as in Fig. 4, but when using the JENDL-HE. As shown the results by JENDL-HE are obviously higher than experimental data \(1.05, 1.14, and 1.33 at 0.8, 1.5, and 3 GeV, respectively\here are many more discrepancies with the experimental data than when using the Cugnon Old JAM nuclear interaction models

The E p,n dnotes the kinetic energy of nucleon  Finally, simulation of neutron production in the lunar subsurface using JENDL-HE at energies below 3 GeV, and JAM at energies above 3 GeV was performed. By comparing the results with the ones achieved by using Cugnon Old + JAM, it is possible to see how the differences in the cross sections influence the results  The difference of the nuclear interaction models for alpha particles in PHITS is of much less importance than the difference between the proton models when estimating the neutron producti on in the lunar subsurface h e default model was used for the alpha particle  4  R ESULTS  In Fig. 7, the calculated neutron density profiles are shown together with the LNPE experimental data. In this figure experimental data including only the 15% measurement error are shown, as well as data including both the 15 measurement error  a nd the 30% systematic error are shown In Fig. 7 \(a\, the results using the Cugnon Old + JAM are shown. The simulations using these models showed good agreement with the LNPE data within the experimental and systematic errors at the region shallower than 300 g/cm 2  However, our calculation was up to 30% higher than the measurements in the deeper region. The results using JENDL-HE + JAM are shown in Fig. 7 \(b\results show better agreement with the experimental data including only the measurement error. However, we should emphasize that when calculations using the JENDL-HE, nearly no neutrons were produced by the secondary pions. No pion production from GCR protons with energies below 3 GeV i.e., the energy region where JENDL-HE works\ are generated when using JENDL-HE + JAM. This may explain why the calculated neutron densities are somewhat lower when using JENDL-HE + JAM than when using the Cugnon old + JAM. It has been suggested by Ishizaki et al 2 t h at t h e ne ut r on p ro d u ct i o n by sec o nda r y pi o n s i s a b o u t  25% of the production from protons and neutrons which are main sources of neutrons when GCRs interact with the lunar material. However, this cannot explain the 30 \226 50 difference of the neutron density profile shown in Fig. 7 \(a and \(b\herefore, the cause of this difference should be studied in more details  The reason why nearly no ne utrons are produced by the secondary pions when using JENDL-HE should be studied in more details. We may need to more carefully check the way to read out the JENDL-HE in PHITS. Nevertheless, it can be predicted that the calculated neutron productions by JENDL-HE should be larger than when only using nuclear interaction models, which is in agreement with the fact that the calculated double differen tial cross sections are so Using Cugnon Old + JAM should therefore provide more reliable results, but then the calculated neutron density profiles are still larger than the LNPE data. This needs to be further investigated  From the results presented in this paper, it was found that more improvements of the simulations of the neutron environment on the Moon ar e necessary. For instance, a 


 7  more precise determination of the solar modulation parameters 003 for further improvement of the GCR spectra is necessary because the 003 used in this work was estimated in different ways from the BESS experiment. More benchmarking of the proton interaction models and the JENDL-HE using more experimental data are needed Based on the results from the benchmarking, the nuclear reaction models used in PHITS might need to be improved Finally all globally acquired data of the chemical composition of the lunar soil should be used in the simulations  5  C ONCLUSION  PHITS simulations of equilibrium neutron density profiles in the lunar subsurface from galactic cosmic ray \(GCR protons and alpha particles were compared with experimental data by the Apollo 17 Lunar Neutron Probe Experiment \(LNPE\.

Indirect and complex rules, on the other hand, confirmed many more hyperlinks  87% and 89%, respectively, due to their larger quantity. These relatively great values that we received may have resulted from the enormous differences between the average number of hyperlinks on a page  10 and the average ranking length: 51, 177, 180 for direct, indirect and complex rules respectively. Concluding, indirect and complex rules appear to be better at assessing the usefulness of hyperlinks compared to direct rules Note that in any case at least 11% of hyperlinks were not confirmed by any rule, so they may be recommended to be removed from the content of pages 8. Conclusions and future work Complex rules combining both direct and indirect rules usually increase the length of rankings compared to those based on direct associations. This helps overcome the problem of a multitude of pages with too short rankings Fig. 5 quested ranking length \(Fig. 6 rules substantially change the order of ranking lists \(Fig. 2 and 3 greater extent only confirm hyperlinks existing on web pages compared to lists extracted from complex rules, for short and long ranking lengths \(Fig. 7 of rules, especially indirect and complex ones, can be useful for the assessment of hyperlinks Concluding, far more diverse indirect rules can significantly improve potential value of recommendation.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
