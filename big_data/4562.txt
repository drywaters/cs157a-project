One of the promising approaches is web usage mining, which mines web logs for user models and recommendations. Different from most web recommender systems that are mainly based on clustering and association rule mining, this paper proposes an 
web personalization system that uses sequential access pattern mining. In the proposed system an efficient sequential patternmining algorithm is used to identify frequent sequential web access patterns. The access patterns are then stored in a compact tree structure, called Pattern-tree, which is then used for matching and generating web links for recommendations In this paper, the proposed system is described, and its performance is evaluated  Keywords- Access Patterns 002 Information Retrieval Personalization I   I NTRODUCTION  It has become much more difficult to access relevant information from the Web With the explosive growth of information available on the World Wide Web. One possible approach to solve this problem is web personalization [1 s res earch focus e s on de vel opi n g an  intelligent recommender system to provide personalized web service for accessing related web pages more efficiently and effectively. The goal of the intelligent recommender system is to determine which web pages are 
more likely to be accessed by the user in the future Various traditional techniques such as collaborative filtering [2 an d  h y b r i d co n t en tb a sed co llab o r a tiv e f ilter i n g  approaches [3 have been d e vel oped fo r s u pport i n g w e b  recommendations. However, such approaches suffer from a major drawback in which most users surf websites anonymously via a proxy, and their identities are hidden and difficult to get. More recent techniques are based on web usage mining, which aims to discover interesting usage patterns derived from the data stored in web server logs or web browser logs. Promising web usage mining techniques such as association rule mining [4 nd cl us t e ri ng 5  hav e  been applied for web recommendations Different from the majority of the existing web recommendation techniques, we propose an intelligent web recommender system known that uses a sequential pattern mining technique. Unlike clustering and association rule mining, sequential pattern mining algorithms al s o  consider the sequential char acteristic of access patterns which is very suitable for predicting the next web pages. In addition, this paper also proposes a compact data model 
called Pattern-tree, which stores the sequential web access patterns, and an efficient approach for user pattern matching and recommendation rules gene ration. Different evaluation measures including precision, satisfaction and applicability are proposed to measure the performance of the recommender system The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the system architect ure of SWARS. Section III discusses the performance evaluation and experimental results. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper II  SYSTEM  ARCHITECTURE An overview of the architecture of the proposed system is given in Fig. 1. First, all usersí web access activities of a website are recorded by the WWW server of the website and stored into the Web Server Logs. Each user access record contains the client IP address, request time, requested URL, user ID, HTTP status code, etc. After obtaining the Web Server Logs, the Sequential Pattern Mining component is applied to mine the user access sequences from the Web Server Logs. Then, the Pattern tree Construction component constructs the recommendation model or Pattern-tree from 
the mined sequential web access patterns. Both the sequential pattern mining and Pattern-tree construction processes are carried out off-line. The Pattern-tree can be updated regularly to incorporate new access data  Web Serve r Lo g s

Each user accessing the website can be identified using his/her IP address. Matching the userís current access sequence from the recommendation model of the Pattern-tree, the Recommendation Rules Generation component will generate recommendation rules. From the recommendation rules, recommended or ëërelatedíí links will be dynamically inserted into the current requested page

 Algorithm: Pattern-tree Construction Input:  set of Sequential Web Access Patterns Output:  T -- Pattern-tree of SWAP Method 1: Create an empty root node R for Pattern-tree T 2: For each sequence S 001\031\0006\000:\000$\0003 denoted as S = e 1 e 2 e n do a: Set current_node point to R b: For i = 1 to n do if current_node has a child node labeled e i use the maximum support between S and this child node as the support of ei and set current_node point to e i  else create a new child node with the support of S denoted as \(e i support of S\ set current_node point to the new child node 3: Return Pattern-tree T  A  Sequential Pattern Mining In general, each line of web logs \(one access record includes the following key information: date-timestamp client IP address, user ID, requested URL, and HTTP status code. We define web logs to be a collection of sequences comprising web access events from each user during their corresponding session in timestamp ascending order Preprocessing must be performed on the web logs prior to applying sequential pattern mining. The main data preprocessing techniques used here include data cleaning user identification, and session identification Letís define sequential pattern mining [8 as f o llo ws Given a sequence database where each sequence is a list of transactions ordered by transaction time with each transaction comprising a set of items, find all sequential patterns with a user-specified minimum support, which is defined as the number of data sequences containing the pattern Let E be a set of unique access events, which represents web resources accessed by users, i.e. web pages, URLs topics or categories. A web access sequence S = e 1 e 2 e n e i 001\031 E 002 i 002 n  is an ordered collection \(sequence\s events, and |S| = n is called the length of the web access sequence. Note that it is not necessary that e j 003 e i for i 003 j  in S that is, item-repetitions are allowed. Suppose we have a set of web access sequences with the set of events, E = {a, b, c d, e, f}. A sample web access sequence database is shown in Table I, which contains four unique web access sequences TABLE  I  A  SAMPLE  DATABASE  OF  WEB  ACCESS  SEQUENCES  Session ID Web Access Sequence 1 a b d a c 2 e a e b c a c 3 b a b f a e 4 a f b a c f c A web access sequence Sí = e 1 e 2 e l is called a subsequence of web access sequence S = e 1 e 2 e n denoted as 000\003 S 004 0006\000\017 if and only if there exists some i j 1 002 i 1 i 2 i l 002 n, such that e j e ij for \(1 002 j 002 l\. For S = e 1 e 2 e k e k+1 e n  S prefix e 1 e 2 e k is called a prefix sequence of S, and S suffix  e k+1 e k+2 e n is called a suffix sequence of S for 1 002 k 002 n Given a database of web access sequences WAS DB S 1  S 2 S m in which S i 1 002 i 002 m\ a web access sequence and |WASDB| = m is called the length of the database. The support of web access sequence S in WASDB is the total number of unique web access sequences in WAS DB that contains S, as defined in the following equation: sup\(S   S i S 004 S i S i 001\031 WAS DB  Note that although access events can be repeated in a web access sequence, any web access sequence S can get a support of at most one from each web access sequence S i A web access sequence S is called a sequential web access pattern, if sup\(S 005 MinSup, where MinSup is a given support threshold. An access event e i 001\031\000 is called a frequent event, if sup\(e i  005 MinSup. Otherwise, it is called an infrequent event TABLE  II  SEQUENTIAL  WEB  ACCESS  PATTERNS  WITH  MINSUP    3  FROM  THE  SAMPLE  DATABASE  IN  TABLE  1 Length of Patterns Sequential Web Access Patterns with Support 1 a:4, b:4, c:3 2 aa:4, ab:4, ac:3, ba:4, bc:3 3 aac:3, aba:4, abc:3, bac:3 4abac:3 Letís consider the web access sequence database in Table I. Suppose the support threshold MinSup = 3, then all the sequential web access patterns supported by at least three web access sequences are listed in Table II B  Pattern-tree Construction A Pattern-tree model is proposed for storing sequential web access patterns compactly, so that it can be used for matching with a userís current access sequence and generating recommendation rules more efficiently in the Recommendation Rules Generation component. In general the set of sequential web access patterns can be treated as a set of strings over a finite alphabet E \(the set of unique access events\ node of the Pattern-tree is labeled with a symbol \(access event\om E and has a corresponding support value. Sometimes, the edges of a Tree are labeled instead of the nodes, but nevertheless refer to the same structure in either case. Once the Pattern-tree is constructed, the original web access sequence database is no longer required for subsequent processing To construct a Pattern-tree, we only need to have one scan of all the sequential web access patterns. Fig. 2 gives the Pattern-tree Construction algorithm, which is based on the set of sequential web access patterns mined by the Sequential Pattern Mining component using CS-mine Fig. 2 The Pattern-tree construction algorithm  Complexity analysis Inserting a sequential web access pattern S into the Pattern-tree T requires two steps. The first step is to search the matching prefix sequence S prefix of S in T, and the second step is to create a new path for the remaining non-matching suffix sequence S suffix of S in T Here we assume equal costs for matching an existing node and creating a new node. Thus, the total cost of inserting a sequential web access pattern S with length m is O\(|S prefix S suffix O\(|S|\ = O\(m\. The complexity of constructing the entire Pattern-tree from scratch is equivalent to the cumulative cost of inserting all sequential

 Algorithm: Recommendation Rules Generation Input T -- Pattern-tree based on a support threshold MinSup S = a 1 a 2 a n current access sequence of a user MinLength - minimum length of access sequence MaxLength - maximum length of access sequence, which should be less than the depth of the Pattern-tree Output RR -- recommendation rule of a set of ordered access eventsfor S Method 1: Initialize RR 006  2: If |S| > MaxLength then remove the first |S|-MaxLength+1 items from S 3: If |S| < MinLength then return RR, else set current_node point to the root node R of T 4: For each item ai from the head of S to the end do a: If current_node has a child node labeled ai, then set current_node point to this child node b: Else remove the first item from S, and repeat from step 3 5: If current_node has child nodes, then insert these child nodes into RR ordered by their supports 6: Return RR  web access patterns S1, S2 Sl with a total length n which is O\(|S 1 S 2 O\(|S l O\(n In practice, web logs are not static since new updates are constantly being added. However, for web recommendation we can assume it to be relatively static for a certain period of time C  Recommendation Rules Generation The Recommendation Rules Generation component searches for the best-matchin g access path in the Patterntree according to the userís current access sequence. In general, the longer the userís current access sequence is, the lower the possibility is of finding the matching path from the Pattern-tree. To increase the applicability of recommendation rules generation, the suffix sequences of the current access sequence will be considered when the matching path of the whol e access sequence cannot be found. As such, we will search the matching path based on the same access sequence by removing the first item repeatedly till a matching path is found or when no more item can be removed from the access sequence. In addition the length of the longest path in the Pattern-tree is the depth of the Pattern-tree. The matching path will not exist when the length of the current access sequence is longer than the depth of the Pattern-tree. Therefore, some initial items can be removed to make the current access sequence shorter than the depth of the Pattern-tree before the sequence matching process begins Fig. 3 Algorithm for Recommendation Rules Generation based on the Patterntree  Generally, the recommendation rules generated from shorter matching paths usually have lower accuracy. In order to improve the precision of recommendation rules generation, only web access se quence whose length is not less than a given threshold can be processed. In other words the sequence matching process will be stopped if the length of the remaining access sequence is less than the threshold Suppose the current access sequence of a user is S a 1 a 2 a n the algorithm for generating recommendation rules for S, Recommendation Rules Generation, is given in Fig. 3 Complexity analysis The cost of looking up the current access sequence S of length m in a Pattern-tree T with MinLength = Lmin and MaxLength = Lmax is O\(min\(m Lmax \mum possible number of lookups is Lmax - Lmin. This gives the total cost of matching S as O\(\(Lmax - Lmin\*min\(m, Lmax \\. The complexity of recommendation rules generation is thus O\(Lmax 2\here Lmax should be less than the depth of the Pattern-tree III  PERFORMANCE  EVALUATION A  Evaluation Measures Let S = a 1 a 2 a k a k+1 a n be a web access sequence. For the prefix sequence Sprefix = a 1 a 2 a k k 005 MinLength\e generate a recommendation rule RR = {e 1 e 2 e m using the Pattern-tree, where all ev ents are ordered by their support If a k+1 001\031 RR, we label the recommendation rule as correct and otherwise incorrect If there exists a i 001\031 RR \(k+1 002 i 002 k+1+m, m>0\e deem the recommendation rule as m-st ep satisfactory. Otherwise we label it as m-step unsatisfactory Let R = {RR 1 RR 2 RR n be a set of recommendation rules, where RR i 1 002 i 002 n\ is a recommendation rule. |R| = n is the total number of recommendation rules in R. We define the following measures Definition 1 Let R c be the subset of R that consists of all correct recommendation rules. The overall web recommendation precision is defined as precision     R R C  This precision measures how probable a user will access one of the recommended pages Definition 2 Let R s m\he subset of R that consists of all m-step satisfactory recommendation rules. The m-step satisfaction for web recommendation is defined as Satisfaction\(m       R m R S  The m-step satisfaction is a very important evaluation measure for web recommendation. Actually, the next web page accessed by a user may not be the target page that the user wants. In many cases, a user has to access some intermediate pages before reaching the target page Therefore, it is not appropriate if we only use the precision measure to evaluate a web recommender system. The mstep satisfaction gives the precision that the recommended pages will be accessed in the near future \(within m steps Clearly, the satisfaction and precision measures are equivalent for m = 1. In order to realistically evaluate our web recommender system, m has been set with an appropriate value m = 5 to indicate that the recommended page should be accessed in the near future

 Definition 3 Let Rn be the subset of R that consists of all nonempty recommendation rules. The applicability of web recommendation is defined as applicability     R R n  As the Pattern-tree only stores web access sub-sequences accessed frequently by users \(with a support of at least MinSup\he recommendation rules generation approach is unable to find recommended pages if the current access sequence does not include a frequent suffix sequence, in which case the generated recommendation rule is empty Therefore, the applicability measure gives a rough idea of how often recommendations will be generated. Some parameters such as MinSup in the proposed approach can influence the applicability of web recommendation Generally, the smaller the MinSup is, the more applicable the web recommendation is. But, this comes at the expense of increased sequential pattern mining and Pattern-tree construction cost B  Experimental Results Let WAS\(MinLength 1 S 2 S n be the set of web access sequences, where each sequence has no less than MinLength items, i.e., min\(|S i  005 MinLength \(1 002 i 002 n MinLength>0\. Given the support threshold MinSup, we construct the Pattern-tree based on WAS\(MinLength WASí\(MinLength+MaxSteps 1 S 2 S k MaxSteps 0, which is the same as m in the definition of m-step satisfaction\ be the set of testing sequences, which is separated from the set of sequences in WAS\(MinLength that contains the training sequences 000\023 000\030 000\024\000\023 000\024\000\030 000\025\000\023 000\025\000\030 000\026\000\023 000\026\000\030 000\024\000\023 000\025\000\023 000\026\000\023 000\027\000\023 000\030\000\023 000\031\000\023 000\032\000\023 000\033\000\023 000\034\000\023 000\024\000\023\000\023 000\024\000\024\000\023 0006\000X\000S\000S\000R\000U\000W\000\003\0007\000K\000U\000H\000V\000K\000R\000O\000G 0005\000X\000Q\000\003\0007\000L\000P\000H\000\013\000V\000H\000F\000\014  Fig. 4 Scalability vs. Support thresholds  In the first experiment, we measured the scalability of the Sequential Pattern Mining and Pattern-tree Construction processes with respect to different support thresholds. We used CS-mine [8 as th e seq u e n tial p a tter n  m i n i n g  algorithm. This experiment used the 22,717 web access sequences with different support thresholds \(from 5 to 100 The experimental results are given in Fig. 4, which shows that the runtime of this pro cess increases sharply as the support threshold is reduced to less than 10 In the second experiment, the scalability of the precision satisfaction, and applicability measures of recommendation rules generation had been measured with respect to different support thresholds. This experiment used MinLength = 2 and MaxSteps = 5 with different support thresholds \(from 5 to 100\ From both experiments, we can conclude that better recommendations can be obtained with smaller support thresholds, at the expense of increased computational complexity for sequential web access pattern mining and maintaining a larger Pattern tree. Balancing the trade-offs between complexity and applicability, we decided to use a support threshold value of 10 for subsequent experiments 000\023\000\010 000\024\000\023\000\010 000\025\000\023\000\010 000\026\000\023\000\010 000\027\000\023\000\010 000\030\000\023\000\010 000\031\000\023\000\010 000\032\000\023\000\010 000\033\000\023\000\010 000\034\000\023\000\010 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\010 000\024\000\025\000\026\000\027\000\030\000\031\000\032\000\033\000\034\000\024\000\023 0007\000K\000H\000\003\000Q\000X\000P\000E\000H\000U\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000U\000H\000F\000R\000P\000P\000H\000Q\000G\000H\000G\000\003\000S\000D\000J\000H\000V 0006\000D\000W\000L\000V\000I\000D\000F\000W\000L\000R\000Q 0003\000U\000H\000F\000L\000V\000L\000R\000Q  Fig. 5 Scalability vs. Number of recommended pages IV  CONCLUSION In this paper, we have proposed an intelligent web recommender system known as WAPPSbased on sequential web access patterns. In the proposed system, the sequential pattern mining algorithm CS-mine is used to mine frequent sequential web access patterns. The mined patterns are stored in the Pattern-tree, which is then used for matching and generating web links for online recommendations.

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web. The future work will apply D-EART on PDF full text document with figures and images instead of using only the abstract part R EFERENCES  Fast algorithms for mining association rules,î In Jorge B Bocca, Matthias Jarke, and Carlo Zaniolo, editors Proc. 20 th Int. conf. of very Large Data Bases, VLDB Santigo, Chile 1994, pp. 487-499  T.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the dataís semantic. This step consists of TAHís and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
