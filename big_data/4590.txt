using risk and preventive set with weight \(RPSW\lgorithm. The proposed method was tested by two benchmark medical data sets The experiments show that the number of attribute-value items of the constraints was significant reduced and the results are understandable and intuitive  Keywords Optimal risk and preventive patterns; Weight; Risk and preventive set; Risk and preventive score matrix I   I NTRODUCTION  An existing fact is that a large amount of medical data has been accumulated in health care services, which may potentially make use of it for disease diagnosis and prevention A number of algorithms developed have demonstrated to be 
able to deal with some analysis of diseases and identify new unexpected, and interesting patterns in hospital infection control and public health surveillance data  1 C4.5 decision trees  2 be u s ed  t o bu i l d di ag n o s i s  models for medical applications  3 H o w e ve r  S o m e fa c t ors  limit its application in medical data. Firstly, the accuracy criterion used by C4.5 may not be directly interpretable to medical practitioners.  Although it can build accurate models in general, it misses many alternative paths which are interesting to medical practitioners and researchers  Association rule mining is another rule discovery method that finds the relationship between attributes, which has been 
widely used in medical fields [5-7  It can cau s e t o o m a n y ru les  especially in low support and uninteresting rules. Within the last decade, a large number of association rule algorithms have been developed for mining all, closed [8 nd m a xi m a l fr eq uent  item-sets [9  B u t m a n y unr e l a t ed  a nd uni nt er e s t i ng r u l e s are emerged as well as. Classic association rule mining methods are Apriori [1  and FP-growth [1  The comprehensibility and efficiency of these two algorithms are their main problems Li et al. [12 f i rs tly m a d e an  id e a  o f  rel a tiv e risk an d  o d d s  ratio into patterns mining. Based on it, mining risk patterns in medical data was developed [13  b u t th is a p p r o ach  still  produces many patterns. A method with optimal risk patterns 
was presented o e x c l u d e supe r f l u o u s pa t t e r ns t h at ar e o f  no interest to medical practitioners We incorporate the weight into our method to judge the importance of attribute-value item. To our best knowledge, the concept of weight was firstly introduced in  15 t o m i ne  association rules of weighted items. This paper aims to propose an optimal method using weights to extract rules more efficiently than the method of optimal risk and preventive patterns in medical data presented by Li et al. [1   II  DEFINITIONS  AND  RPSW  ALGORITHM A  Definitions 1  Risk and preventive patterns 
Medical data may be divided into two classes by malignant and benign. Patterns are defined as a set of attribute-value item A risk pattern in this paper refers to the antecedent of a rule with the consequence of malignant and a preventive pattern with the consequence of benign. How to judge a pattern is risk or preventive? One of the most often used ratios in epidemiological studies is relative risk or odds ratio, a concept for the comparison of two groups or populations with respect to a certain undesiarbale event. Here we only use relative risk We will define the following risk and preventive patterns formally using the value of relative risk Definition1. Risk patterns are frequent patterns, whose relative risk is greater than a given threshold. Conversely 
preventive patterns are frequent patterns, whose relative risk is less than a given threshold 2  Optimal risk and preventive patterns Mining risk and preventive patterns can bring redundant patterns and are not convenient to observe results for users  As a result, MORE \(Mining Optimal Risk pattErnsets\ algorithm was designed by Li et al [1  for o ptimal risk and preventive patterns The reason why optimal risk and preventive patterns can be mined is that optimal risk and preventive patterns set satisfy anti-monotone property. They are proved in [14   Definition2 Optimal risk \(or preventive\ttern set includes patterns that have  higher \(or lower in case the relative 
risk is less than 1\ than relative rsik of their simple form patterns Optimal risk and preventative patterns are extracted from risk and preventive patterns. When the relative risk of risk patterns are less than or equal to that of their sub-patterns and This project supported by Yunnan Fundamental Research Foundation of Application \(No: 2009ZC 049M\ and Science Research Foundation of Kunming University of \(No: 2009-022 Corresponding author Tel: +86 871 5847033 or +61 8 83023898; Fax 61 8 83023381 978-1-4244-4713-8/10/$25.00 \2512010 IEEE 


the relative risk of preventive patterns are more than or equal to that of their sub-patterns, these risk and preventive patterns are ignored 3  Risk and preventive set Based on optimal risk and preventive patterns, we can calculate the frequency of each attribute-value item and sort all attribute-value items in the frequency decreasing order with statistics. The attribute-value items existed in optimal risk patterns can develop a risk set while those in optimal preventive patterns can generate a preventive set. We define risk set and preventive set as follows Definition3. If an attribute-value item is a frequent element of optimal risk/preventive patterns and its frequency is greater than or equal to the given expected frequency threshold, then it belongs to risk/preventive set Mining risk and preventive set is more efficient than mining optimal  risk and preventive patterns. The first reason is that we only care about attribute-value items instead of the combination of each other. The second reason is that we can know the weight of each attribute-value item by calculating the frequency of each attribute-value item, and then we can easily know what contribution each attribute-value item is for mining the pattern set B  RPSW Algorithm If we suppose that 1 n is the number of optimal risk patterns 2 n is the number of optimal preventive patterns; supp is the local support [1 res h ol d   t h en  supp n 1  and supp n 2  are expected frequency threshold of initial risk and preventive set respectively We also define 1 kand 2 k are the number of attribute-value item existed in IRS \(Initial Risk Set\ and IPS \(Initial Preventive Set  k 1 and  k 2 are the number of attribute-value item existed in RS \(Risk Set\ and PS \(Preventive Set\ respectively. So we can suppose that T k 3 2 1  IRi  IRi  IRi  IRi IRS 1   T k 3 2 1  IPi  IPi  IPi  IPi IPS 2  their corresponding IRFS Initial Risk Frequency Set\ and IPFS \(Initial Preventive Frequency Set\ are T k 3 2 1  IRf  IRf  IRf  IRf 1 and T k 3 2 1  IPf  IPf  IPf  IPf 2 IRFS and IPFS should have follow property as \(2\ and \(3\ depicting  supp n IRf IRf IRf IRf 1 k 3 2 1 1      1  supp n IPf IPf IPf IPf 2 k 3 2 1 2      2  If   IPS IRS we should remove their common attribute-value items because of contradiction between IRS and IPS. Then we can get RS, RFS, PFS and PS IRS RS   IRFS RFS   IPS PS  and IPFS PFS  If we can suppose that T  k 3 2 1  Ri  Ri  Ri  Ri RS 1  and T  k 3 2 1  Pi Pi  Pi  Pi PS 2  their corresponding RFS \(Risk Frequency Set\ and PFS \(Preventive Frequency Set\ are T  k 3 2 1  Rf  Rf  Rf  Rf 1 and T  k 3 2 1  Pf  Pf  Pf  Pf 2 RFS and PFS are also characterized by the following \(4\ and \(5  supp n Rf Rf Rf Rf 1  k 3 2 1 1      3  supp n Pf Pf Pf Pf 2  k 3 2 1 2      4 The weight of each attribute-value item in RS and PS is represented by RSM \(Risk Score Matrix\d PSM \(Preventive Score Matrix\ RSM and PSM are described as follows, as in \(6 and \(7  T j  k j 3 j 2 j 1  Rf Rf 100  Rf Rf 100  Rf Rf 100  Rf Rf 100  RSM  1 k 1 j 1  1 k 1 j  1 k 1 j  1 k 1 j          5 T j  k j 3 j 2 j 1  Pf Pf 100  Pf Pf 100  Pf Pf 100  Pf Pf 100  PSM  2 k 1 j 2  2 k 1 j  2 k 1 j  2 k 1 j          6 From \(6\ and \(7\, we can know that a patient is risk when the weight is equal to or greater than  Rf Rf 100 Rf Rf 100   1 k 1 j  1 k 1 j j 2 j 1      and a patient is preventive when the weight is equal to or greater than  Pf Pf 100 Pf Pf 100   2 k 1 j  2 k 1 j j 2 j 1       RPSW algorithm has two functions, one function can generate IRS and IPS and another function can develop RS and PS with weight III  EXPERIMENTAL  RESULTS A  Experimental Results We used two benchmark medical data sets from UCI repositories [16  to compare the efficiency with optimal risk/preventive patterns, representative risk/preventive patterns which are described in TABLE 1 1  Comparison with optimal risk/preventive patterns and representative risk/preventive patterns 


We use different distributions as 20 and 3 for data sets Hypothyroid and Breast cancer respectively. The purpose of different distributions is to test popularity of method We set the minimum local support as supp=5%, the length of the attribute-value item as L=4 and L=5, minimum relative risk as 1.5 is a default value for MORE algorithm We firstly generate optimal risk/preventive patterns and representative risk/preventive patterns with MORE  algorithm and then accumulate attribute-value items in optimal risk/preventive patterns. Attribute-value items in optimal risk patterns are used to generate risk set while attribute-value items in optimal preventive patterns are used to generate preventive set. Furthermore, we calculate the number of attribute-value items in optimal risk/preventive patterns, representative risk/preventive patterns, and risk/preventive set  TABLE 2 reports that the number of attribute-value item in risk/preventive set is smaller than that in optimal risk preventive patterns and in representative risk/preventive patterns 2  The weight of each attri bute-value item in risk and preventive set The weight of each attribute-value item is from the percentage of each attribute-value item in risk and preventive set. But we suppose the total weight is 100, and the percentage of each attribute-value item multiplying 100 is the weight of each attribute-value item. The weight of each attribute-value item is used to know how important each attribute-value item is at the same time, we can know a patient’s risk weight and preventive weight using it Fig. 1 lists the weight of each attribute-value item in risk set of hypothyroid and breast cancer. We can see the first two largest weights of attribute-value item are “thyroid_surgery t” \(18.3150\nd “query_hypothyroid = t” \(12.0879\n hypothyroid, while the first two largest weights of attribute value item are “bare_nuclei = l” \(14.3498\ and clump_thickness = l” \(11.6592\ in breast cancer. In hypothyroid, the sum of the first two largest weights of attribute-value item is 30.4029. It means that if a patient’s weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 30.4029 the patient is at risk of hypothyroid. Similarly, if a patient’s weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 26.009 the patient is at risk of breast cancer. Fig. 2 shows the weight of each attribute-value item in preventive set of hypothyroid and breast cancer. We also can know that the first two largest weights of attribute-value item are “thyroid_surgery = f 23.7624\and “goitre = f” \(20.7921\n hypothyroid, while the first two largest weights of attribute-value item are bland_chromatin = s” \(20.4762\ and “bare_nuclei = s 17.1429\east cancer. Therefore, a patient has little probability of hypothyroid if the weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 44.5545. Similarly, a patient has little probability of breast cancer if the weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 37.6191 The sum of the first two largest weights of attribute-value item is used to be a threshold which can decide a patient’s condition. Therefore, the attribute-value item with high weight can construct a risk/preventive pattern using few combinations while the attribute-value item with low weight can construct a risk/preventive pattern using more combination. The length of a pattern is at least 2. The minimum length of a pattern is also decided by different conditions T ABLE 1 A simple description of UCI medical data set Name #Records #Attributes Distributions Hypothyroid 3163 25 4.8% and 95.2 Breast cancer 699 10 34.5% and 65.4  t h y r o i d _ s u r g e r y    t  q u e r y _ h y p o t h y r o i d    t T 4 U    0  9 3 5  T S H    6  3 5 2 7  5 T 3 _ m e a s u r e d    y T S H    2 7  5  T S H _ m e a s u r e d    y T T 4    2 4  5 5 5  5 T T 4  5 5  5 8 1  5 F T I    2 8  5 6 4  5 T 3     0  7 5 T B G _ m e a s u r e d    n F T I _ m e a s u r e d    y  T 4 U _ m e a s u r e d    y  T T 4 _ m e a s u r e d    y 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18    The weight of attribute-value items in risk set hypothyroid The weight of attribute-value items The weight of attribute-value items The attribute-value item  a\ The weight of attribute-value item in risk set, the data set is hypothyroid b a r e _ n u c l e i    l c l u m p _ t h i c k n e s s    l b l a n d _ c h r o m a t i n    m n o r m a l _ n u c l e o l i    l b l a n d _ c h r o m a t i n    l u n i f o r m i t y _ o f _ c e l l _ s h a p e    l u n i f o r m i t y _ o f _ c e l l _ s h a p e    m u n i f o r m i t y _ o f _ c e l l _ s i z e    m u n i f o r m i t y _ o f _ c e l l _ s i z e    l m a r g i n a l _ a d h e s i o n    l s i n g l e _ e p i t h e l i a l    m n o r m a l _ n u c l e o l i    m m i t o s e s    l m a r g i n a l _ a d h e s i o n    m  s i n g l e _ e p i t h e l i a l    l 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14   The weight of attribute-value items The attribute-value ite m The weight of attribute-value items in risk set breast cancer The weight of attribute-value items  b\ The weight of attribute-value item in risk set, the data set is breast cancer Fig. 1  The weight of attribute-value item in risk set, supp=0.05 and L=4 T ABLE 2  Comparison with the number of attribute-value items in optimal risk/preventive patterns, representative risk/ preventive pat terns, and risk/preventive set The medical data set is hypothyroid, the number of  condition “supp=0.05 and L=4” is prior to “/” and the number of  condition supp=0.05 and L=5” is after  optimal risk patterns represent ative risk patterns risk set the number of attribute-value item 459/645 43/48 15/15  optimal preventive patterns representative preventive patterns preventive set the number of attribute-value item 214/236 66/66 6/6

Experimental results can conclude that optimal risk and preventive patterns are suitable for initial data analysis; the proposed algorithm is useful for decision of medical practitioners and researchers. The results are understandable and may reveal some intuitive indicators to medical practitioners and researchers. It can generate smaller size of set and provide with corresponding weight with each attribute-value item, it is a post-processing based on optimal risk and preventive patterns R EFERENCES  1  Brossette, S.E.Sprague, A.P.Hardin, J.M.Waites, K.B.Jones, W.

E.g.: Shelf height B  Time Variant data The data set provided contained purchase invoices of a single month. Hence, the analysis carried to was limited to the data of only one month. If more data is available, a time variant analysis with the appropriate weightings can also be undertaken C  Time Spent by customer in various Zones Since the data provided did not contain the time dimension the analysis done in this paper misses out on the time spent by customers on different products in various zones which can have an influence on the attractions of the products and their locations and hence, can produce more accurate results for more appropriate recommendations  D  Mulitple Entry Points to a store The store layout has been constrained with a single entry and exit point. Variations in the same can have considerable effects on the results E  Deviating from path Customers The shortest paths assigned to the customers, by the approach used in this paper are not applicable for the entire set of customers. This is because there may be some customers who deviate from the shortest path while traversing the store.

7 ForestCoverType  data is shown in Figure 6 Appendix as an example The tool takes this data as input and produces the hierarchical clusters of data by setting different clustering parameters With the help of this tool user can see  the generated hierarchy of the clusters along with the data present in each cluster. For the experiment we sele cted the row wise clustering option and the algorithm used f or this type of clustering was the Euclidean algorithm. The reason for this choice is that Euclidean distance is the m ost commonly used type of distance measure in cluster analysis It uses raw data instead of standardized data to compute the distances Using the complete linkage method the hierarchal clusters are produced, it can be seen from the Figu re 2 that 3 distinct clusters are produced where each one of them is having its specific hierarchy B Automatic Schema generation In this step the cluster results file which was ex ported using the HCE tool becomes the input of the automat ic schema builder. We developed a prototype to automat e the process of schema generation The prototype takes t he clustered data and generates the schema of any part icular type such as star snowflake or galaxy/constellatio n The prototype has been developed using the C sharp C  programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005 Once the hierarchical clustering has been done, the  next step is to extract this hierarchical information in the form of cluster information tables which are fed into the d eveloped prototype called Automatic Schema Generator Figure  3 depicts the main interface of the Automatic Schema Generator having the clustered relationship data C luster names are the abbreviations which are formed using the first letters of each cover type for example clus ter name for C1 is PCD, which means cover types of Ponderosa pine Cottonwood and Douglas-fir PCD All other names are abbreviated by using the first alphabetical letters  After reading the cluster relationship file the bu tton of Create Schema as shown in the following diagram displays the schema selection window. Figure 4 show s the schema selection window of automatic schema builder  Using this selector window cluster name and type o f schema can be selected to build database in the dat abase server. User can select from star, snowflake and ga laxy or constellation options of schema type using the radi o button The “Generate” button on the bottom of schema selec tor window performs the following major functions 1\Generates automatic database in the database serv er 2\Creates dimension and fact tables for the schema type selected 3\Manage relationships among the tables 4\Upload data in the fact and dimension tables from the clustered file After performing the above mentioned functions the  control is passed to the schema visualization windo w which gives a glimpse of the schema created automatically  as shown in Figure 5  Fig 2: Hierarchical clusters generated by HCE tool Fig 3 User interface of automatic schema builder Fig 4 Schema Selector window 41 


Fig 5 Schema visualization window V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we reviewed the literature regarding  the integration of OLAP with data mining and automatic generation of OLAP schema. Literature review reveal ed the fact that none of the previous works targeted at th e automatic schema generation from the mined data set  Furthermore the works in the past pose a number of limitations. The major limitation of the previous w ork was the absence of a model that can produce the three b asic types of OLAP schema star, snowflake and galaxy Based on these observations we presented the model for th e integration of data mining and OLAP along with the automatic generation of OLAP schema. We have develop ed a prototype for the automatic schema generation Th is developed prototype takes mined data and produces t he schema of user’s choice Finally we implemented the  proposed model and evaluated the results with the h elp of experiment It is evident from the result that the prototype system overcomes the manual schema design and implementation requirement in the data warehousing environment We are working on the enhancement of t he proposed model for automatic schema generation One  possible way of enhancement is the use of other dat a mining techniques along with OLAP for the schema generation. Further more, we are exploring how OLAP can be further extended and enhanced to meet the new challenges and to make it more effective efficient  and intelligent OLAP REFERENCES 1  S   C h a u d h u r i  a n d  U   D a y a l   A n  o v e r v i e w  o f  d a t a  warehousing and OLAP technology ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 26 1997\, pp 6574 2  A   C u z z o c r e a   D   S a c c a  a n d  P   S e r a f i n o   A  h i e r a rchy driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualizati on of multidimensional data cubes in Proc of 8th Int’l Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery \(DaWak Springer Verlag 2006\, pp. 106-119 3  S   M a n s m a n n  a n d  M   S c h o l l   E x p l o r i n g  O L A P  a g g r e gates with hierarchical visualization techniques, in Proc. of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2007\, pp. 1067-1073 4  F a y y a d  U  M   P i a t e s k y S h a p i n o  G    S m y t h  P   a n d  U thurusany R From datamining to knowledge discovery: An overvie w,”in Proc. of Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery MIT Press, pp. 134 5   S   G o i l  a n d  A   C h o u d h a r y    H i g h  p e r f o r m a n c e  O L AP and data mining on parallel computers Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 391-417, Dec. 1997 6   S   A s g h a r   D   A l a h a k o o n  a n d  A   H s u    E n h a n c i n g  OLAP functionality using selforganizing neural networks  Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1-20, March 2004 7   R   B   M e s s a o u d   O   B o u s s a i d  a n d  S   R a b a s e d a    A new OLAP aggregation based on the AHC technique,” in Proc. of the 7th ACM Int’l Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP DOLAP ACM New York, 2004, pp. 65-72 8   J   H a n    T o w a r d s  o n l i n e  a n a l y t i c a l  m i n i n g  i n  l arge databases ACM SIGMOD Record vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 97-107, March 1998 9   V   M a r k l   F   R a m a s a k  a n d  R   B a y e r    I m p r o v i n g  OLAP performance by multidimensional hierarchical clustering in Proc of the 1999 Int’l Symposium on Database Engineering and Applica tions IDEAS 1999, p. 165 10   V   M a r k l  a n d  R   B a y e r    P r o c e s s i n g  r e l a t i o n a l  OLAP queries with UB-trees and multidimensional hierarchical clusteri ng in Proc of the Int’l.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
