This paper studies the characteristic of commonsense knowledge which is use to eliminate redundant association rules, and analyzes the impact of commonsense knowledge and the special rules whose 
confidence is 100% on the generation of redundant rules. Some theorems and corollaries of redunda nt rules are proposed and a new method for eliminating redundant rules based on these theories is proposed. This new method can prune some redundant rules by using commonsense knowledge and the special rules without calculating confidence, so it improved the efficiency of mining and the utilization of discovered association rules Keywords-Association Rule Mining; Redundant Rules Commonsense Knowledge I   I NTRODUCTION  Association rule mining was proposed for the first time in 1993  a n d today t h is m e thod as a prom inent da ta analysis tools has widely been used in many fields such as network intrusion detection  c u st om er relations hi p management  of traffic acci de nts 4], m e dical 
diagnosis  protein st ruct ure analysis 6] and so on However, the existence of massive redundant rules has made the analysis very difficult, and has been a main barrier to efficient utilization of discovered association rules. Many meaningless rules are easily generated even with a high support and confidence threshold 7   This pa pe r is concerned with the following two types of meaningless rules: firstly, some rules corre spond to the prior knowledge thus they are meaningless for end user to make decisions 7  This kind of rules is called the first redundant rule in this paper. Secondly, some rules are considered to be meaningless when the information or knowledge conveyed in which corresponds to or is covered by other discovered rules  of rules is called the second redundant rule in this paper Many previous works have pa 
id attention to eliminate redundant rules. The method us ing metadata information to eliminate redundant rules was proposed in  h e m e thods using semantic knowledge to eliminate redundant rules were proposed in   e th ods fo r eliminating the second redundant rules were proposed in  12][13  15].But those studies donít consider the following questions: Which kind of prior knowledge can be used to eliminate redundant rules? What is the characteristic of this knowledge? What is the impact of this kind of kno wledge or the special rules \(in this paper, the ìspecial rulesî refers to the discovered association rules whose confi dence is 100%\the generation of the second redu ndant rules? Based on those questions and research results mentioned above, this paper proposes a new method for eliminating redundant rules by 
using commonsense knowled ge and the special rules The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, this paper presen ts a brief introduction of association rule mining. In sec tion 3, this paper presents the characteristic of commonsense knowledge and some theorems and corollaries of redundant rules. In section 4, a new method for eliminating redu ndant rules is proposed in detail. In section 5, a practical example proves the effective of this new method, and then conclusion is described in the last section II  ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  The association rule mining task can be stated as follows let D be a transaction dataset, and let 123    n I xx x x 
i  be the items appear in the dataset. We denote an itemset contains i items as X x i where x X We denote transaction set, in which each transaction contains itemset X as note that  tX     ii tX t x tx   tX  ii i.e., the transaction set can be generated by intersection operation of 
transaction set tx where x is the each item in itemset X We use the notation tX to refer transaction set is the subset of    ij tX  i tX  j tX We use notation  D to refer the number of transactions in the dataset, use notation  tX to refer the number of transactions that contain itemset 
X  An association rule is an expression A B where A  B   is  an itemset. Two important constraints of association rule mining are support and confidence  w h ere   sup   tAB port A B    tAB confidence A B tA An D

 association rule is considered to be a strong rule if and  where min_sup and min_conf are user-specified minimum thresholds. More detailed instructions about association rule mining methods can be found in sup   min_ sup port A B min_co confidence A B nf 1 1 6 III  REDUNDANT ASSOCIATION RULES  A  The First Redundant Rules Rules are considered to be no interesting if they correspond to prior knowledge  Com m onsense knowledge is one kind of prior knowledge, and has following characteristics I  Necessity If the antecedent of knowledge occurs the consequent of knowledge w ill inevitably occur and the consequent has the unique value. This characteristic can be expressed in the form of association rule like where CK.A stands for the antecedent of commonsense knowledge; CK.C stands for the consequent of commonsense knowledge. CK.A and CK.C may be a \(an\pt \(be havior, object, attribute\ or a \(an\oncept \(behavior, object, attribute\ set      100 confidence CK A CK C II  Correctness The probability that CK.C occurs  given that CK.A has  occurred is 100%, and in most case, this value is correct III  Universality Commonsense knowledge is widely known, or in some professional f ields, it is familiar for the most of users in those fields  Commonsense knowledge is widely accepted as correct it may be the axiom, the theo rem, the relationship between the object and its essential attribute, or the accumulate experience that has be proved to be right by practice and so on. For example are all commonsense knowledge apple fruit  chlorine is toxic  lady female  According to the characteristics of commonsense knowledge, the following definition is proposed Definition 1 Rule A B is the first redundant rule if and  ACKA  B CK C  B  The Second Redundant Rules If all the rules in a collection R have the same support and confidence, the simplest rules in the collection should suffice to represent the whole set. Thus the non-redundant rules in the collection R are those most general, i.e., those having minimal antecedents and consequents a n d the other rules in the collection are redundant rules. Three theorems about the second redundant rules are proposed as follows Theorem 1 If  then the rule confidence A X  A X B is equivalent to the rule A B and is the second redundant rul e Proof If it means that X always occurs in the transaction where occurs, put another way the transaction set where A occurs must be a subset of the transaction set where X occurs. This is can be given as confidence A X  A    tA tX 1                    sup   sup        rule has the same support and confid tAXtAtXtA t ABX t AX t B t A t B t AB t ABX t AB t AXB t AB port AX B DD port A B t AXB t AB confidence AX B tAX tA confidence A B AX B     ence with rule and rule has minimal antecedent is redundant rule AB AB AX B  Theorem 2 If then the rule is equivalent to the rule and is redundant rule 100 confidence A X BAX BA Proof    100                     sup   sup        confidence A X tA tX tAXtAtXtA tABX tAX tB tA tB tAB t ABX t AB tAXB tAB port B AX DD port B A tAXB tAB confidence B AX tB tB confidence B A      rule has the same support and confidence with rule and rule has minimal consequent is redundant rule BAX BA BA BAX s  Theorem 3 If then the rule 100 confidence A X A BX is equivalent to the rule A B and is the second redundant rule Proof

This method can eliminate two kinds of redundant rules by using commonsense knowledge and the special rules without calculating confidence \(as sh own in Figure 1  Step1 Preprocess data and find all frequent itemset using Apriori algorithm method  Step2 For each frequent itemset , judge whether can generate redundant rule with commonsense knowledge and the special rules  Step3 If a frequent itemset will not generate redundant rules then calculate confidence and output strong association rules and store the rules whose confidence is 100% into the RB where RB stands for Rule Base which is used to store the special rules Note that the simple commonsense knowledge such as the hierarchical relationship among objects, or the attribute relationship between an object and its attribute can be inferred by using domain ontology \(ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to reason about the properties of that domain, and may be used to define the domain   d infe re nce r u les. T h e ot h e r complex knowledge can be in putted by users .Both two kinds of commonsense know ledge are stored in KB where KB stands for Knowledge Base which is used to store commonsense knowledge  Figure 1  A new method for eliminating redundant rules The redundant rule eliminate algorithm is the core part of this new method, and can be described as follows Algorithm Generate non-redundant association rules Input L k min_conf KB  RB  L k  is frequent k-itemsets Output non-redundant association rules Method   RB  for each K lL  l is a k-itemset in L K for each s l  is the subset of l  s if    R edundantRuleJudging l s KB  if RB then  min_   GenerateRule l s conf RB  else if    R edundantRuleJudging l s RB n  min_   GenerateRule l s conf RB

A new method for eliminating redundant rules is proposed. This new method can prune redundant rules by using commonsense knowledge and the special rules without calculating confidence, so it improved the efficiency of mining and the utilization of discovered association rules.

Fig. 5 shows the execution time according to changes in the threshold value of weight when using SYN and UCC data. From this figure, we can see that the execution time is greatly influenced by the threshold values. In contrast, in case of file-level prefetching, the change in threshold value of weight does not give a great effect on the execution time For both SYN and UCC data, when the threshold value is set to 2, the proposed method shows the shortest execution time In case of less than 3 \(i.e., prefetching all \(or most of\e objects belonging to the generated sequential patterns excessive prefetching causes a big increase in the execution time. Conversely, as the threshold value becomes higher than the optimal value, the favorable effect from prefetching decreases gradually V  S UMMARY  In this paper, we have proposed an intelligent two-level prefetching method in which sequential pattern mining is incorporated into the FAST-aware hybrid flash-disk storage system. In our work, the hybrid storage uses the flash memory as a cache space, and we focus on prefetching file or block\objects onto prefetch \(or sequential\og blocks to be accessed in the near future through sequential pattern mining. To achieve the best performance, it is very important to determine optimal values in terms of threshold of pattern weight and the size of training data. To be noted is that the proposed method works at the level of file and block objects   b\In case of SYN data   b\In case of SYN data Figure 5: Effect of changes in weight threshold In contrast, previous studies focused on prefetching block-level objects [1 i t h si m p l e he u r i s t i c s e v e n t h o ugh they cannot be applied to hybrid storage systems. On the whole, the proposed two-level prefetching is more effective than file-level prefetching in UCC and the synthetic data Empirical results show that in terms of the execution time the proposed method improves the I/O performance of hybrid storage by about 16% and 18% for UCC and SYN data, respectively, compared to the Top-N prefetching under the FAST scheme. We submit that two-level prefetching can help to significantly enhance the future commercial hybrid storage products. In the future, we plan to study a way of semi-automatically adjusting several parameters such as the weight threshold and the size of training data for sequential pattern mining A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the Basic Research Program through the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology \(Grant Number: R01-2007-000-206490  R EFERENCES  1  Hybrid drive: Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive 2  S.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
