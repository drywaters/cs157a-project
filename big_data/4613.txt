response to degrading conditi ons. Two major inter-related barriers to realizing this potential include the cost of implementation in legacy and ne w aircraft and the lack of data to develop or mature algorithms. The cost of incorporating the additional sensing, data collection processing and communications hardware into legacy aircraft can be prohibitive, particularly if qualification/requalification of hardware and software are required. This situation is frequently confounded by a lack of credibility in regard to the end state health management capability. Data on system degradations and failures are not available to verify health management methods and payoff Laboratory seeded fault and run-to-failure testing are expensive and lack traceability to the operational 
environment. To address these hurdles Boeing is researching architectures base d on affordable, low footprint sensing, communications, storage and processing technologies to enable the onboard implementation and maturation of health management applications Affordability considerations drive these architectures toward the partitioning of fli ght/mission critical and support critical elements of health management, and the synergistic use of common sensing, processing and communications resources  The chafing protection system \(CHAPS\oped by Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing Inc \(KMM point. CHAPS uses multiple optical fibers within wire bundles as sensors to detect chafing. The onset of chafing reduces the transmission charact eristics of the optical fiber which can be detected and lo cated using an Optical Time 
Domain Reflectometer \(OTDR\OTDR is implemented as hand-held support equipment that is used to periodically test for chafing  The CHAPS concept has been extended to the use of the CHAPS optical fibers to also communicate health management data. The concept is referred to as CHAPSHealth Management, or CHAPS-HM and uses the CHAPS enabled wire bundles to form a Network for Integrated Vehicle Health Management \(IVHM\munications that is 1\ partitioned from flight/mission critical applications, 2 has low weight impact and 3\s relatively benign in regard to flight worthy certification. The OTDR, implemented as support equipment in the CHAPS concept, is replaced with a miniaturized Optical Ph ase Domain Reflectometer 


  2 OPDR\ which both detects and locates chafing, and functions as a transceiver to communicate IVHM data  A split ring fiber optic connector facilitates the coupling of CHAPS enabled fiber to support IVHM data communications as well as provide an improved method of connecting to the CHAPS ground based test equipment if that is desired. CHAPS is relatively mature in that the concept has been flight tested on both fixed wing and rotorcraft. The CHAPS-HM concept with onboard transceiver/OPDR and the split ring connector are new concepts but based on established methods and have been prototyped in laboratory demonstrations. Work is ongoing to implement these technologies in a form that minimizes size, weight, power and reliability. Work is also progressing to develop architectures for health management communications networks for various platforms by using CHAPS \226 HM and other technologies such as wireless communications, sensor networks and mode dependent use of existing communications and processing resources. The success of this approach require s careful consideration as to the impact on maintenance, weight penalty and the value of the chafing detection and IVHM capability enabled  2  N EED A DDRESSED  Successful implementation of condition based maintenance CBM access to high fidelity data CBM implies knowledge of the condition of the system, or component of interest, to the level that will allow maintenance to be performed prior to an operational failure thus avoiding the negative impacts of an unanticipated failure. Data acquisition to support these higher end predictive capabilities typically involve sampling rates of 1kHz or greater as shown in Figure 1  Many IVHM applications requiring higher data acquisition rates pose significant technical challenges to onboard for platform implementation. The choice is either to provide local, point of source processing, or high bandwidth     communication resources to move the data to a more central processing element. Even if local processing is provisioned and the required bandwidth is reduced by generation of higher value processed data, health management system maturation requirements still require the communication of at least, a sizable subset of the streaming sensor data Specific to wiring problems, with in the Navy aircraft fleet 4,841 power wire removals per year were experienced and 2 electrical fires a month while devoting 5-9 percent of 20 million maintenance man-hours per year trouble-shooting and repairing wiring failu  Insul a t i on breakdown and chafing are identified as ma jor contributors to these statistics. Based on the need for wiring integrity and the requirements to implement CBM applications; the CHAPS and CHAPS-HM concepts offer unique capabilities and a potential affordable path to implementing CBM on high valued platforms 3  CHAPS CHAPS detects the onset of ch afing by means of a \221sense shield\222 consisting of a number of optical fibers \(sensors incorporated within wire bundles as shown in Figure 2. The fibers are terminated by a c onnector.  One application of this is shown in Figure 3 where the fiber optic \223pins\224 are mounted in multi-termination MT Amphenol that are designed for housing inside a MIL-DTL38999 Series III Size 11 military connector shell. The two guide pins are visible on the black rectangular MT ferrule The fibers are not visible, but are located between the guide pins  Fiber optic continuity is tested using an OTDR which is implemented as support equipment and interfaces via the test connector. Designs are de scribed below that locate the test mechanism onboard  The OTDR operates on the same principle as a radar system 0 10 10 3 10 2 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 0 10 10 3 10 2 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 Temperature Fuel Pressure System Flight Control \(e.g Actuator Position Subsystem InterLoop Control Blade Or Gear Monitoring Eddy Current Vibration Monitoring Accelerometer Motor Current Structural Monitoring Acoustic Emissions Hz 0 10 10 3 10 2 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 0 10 10 3 10 2 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 Temperature Fuel Pressure System Flight Control \(e.g Actuator Position Subsystem InterLoop Control Blade Or Gear Monitoring Eddy Current Vibration Monitoring Accelerometer Motor Current Structural Monitoring Acoustic Emissions Hz  Figure 1 \226 Sampling Rates of Health Management Data Sources 


  3 in that it does the following: 1\ical pulses down an  optical fiber, 2\the optical pulses interact with the fiber and reflect back to the OTDR, 3\easures the amount of light returned and the time returned, 4\the amount of light loss correlates to fiber damage and the time for the return indicates to location of damage. More advanced photon counting OTDR technology enhances this performance by using very short optical pulses which provides a more accurate distance measurement as well as a more detailed characterization of the damage allowing it to detect and trend damage from its early inception. A schematic of an OTDR based system is shown in Figure 4  CHAPS sensors, optical fibers can be placed to run the length of the wire bundle and stop or return to their origin The full loop return provides two paths to a given damage location. Multiple sensors provide better coverage and insurance against false alar ms. Branching cables can be monitored by running up one branch, then returning to go up a second branch, and then returning once more to the origin. A sample OTDR signature from a single ended, nonlooping, sensor is shown in Figure 5.  Since the objective of the CHAPS installation is to provide prevent chafing, the OTDR is used to read the se nsors periodically to catch the early signs of damage   4  CHAPS-HM The CHAPS-HM concept uses the CHAPS sensors \(the optical fibers\municat e support critical IVHM data in addition to its role in detecting and locating chafing. The overall objective was to couple CHAPS enabled cables as well as other communications links to provide an extensive communication network for IVHM  The key components of CHAPS-HM are a miniature transceiver/OPDR and a split ring connector. The transceiver/OPDR communicates data through the optical fibers as well as serves as an onboard test device for chafing. The split ring connect or mounts on the wire bundle and provides a means to couple optical fibers. It also provides a simpler, less intrusive test connector in a CHAPS only application  Transceiver/OPDR In the CHAPS-HM concept the transceiver/OPDR serves the dual role as the interface to communicate data from a local processing element to a OTDR OPTICAL FIBER OTDR OPTICAL FIBER OTDR OPTICAL FIBER  Figure 5\226 Representative OTDR Plot for Single End Sensor A pp lication   Figure 3 - Fiber optic MT ferrule within MILDTL-38999 size 11 Connector  Figure 2 - CHAPS Enabled Wire Bundle Sensing System B Sensing System A Microprocessor Storage Sensor A1 Switching System 1 Switching System A Switching System B Test Instrument OTDR Computer Optical Fiber Electrical Connection Key USB Sensor A2 Sensor A3 Sensor B1 Sensor B2 Sensor B3       Sensing System B Sensing System A Microprocessor Storage Sensor A1 Switching System 1 Switching System A Switching System B Test Instrument OTDR Computer Optical Fiber Electrical Connection Key Optical Fiber Electrical Connection Key USB Sensor A2 Sensor A3 Sensor B1 Sensor B2 Sensor B3         Figure 4\226 Schematic of the CHAPS OTDR System 


  4 central processing element, and as a test device to provide an onboard, online chafing detection capability. A breadboard prototype of the OPDR is shown in Figure 6 The OTDR was replaced by OPDR technology for the onboard application to reduce size and weight. The package product is expected to weigh less than 6 oz and have a very compact form factor               Split Ring Connector and Health Management Networks The split ring connector that facilitates the coupling of CHAPS enabled cables to IVHM data communications as well as improving the method to connect to the CHAPS test equipm ent especially if the tester is not implemented on-platform. The connector provides a means to bring the fiber out of the wire bundle to interface it to a processing element with in a Line Replaceable Unit LRU\ to another optical fiber  This ability to bypass an LRU, depicted in Figure 7 provides additional flexibility in routing the optical fiber within the platform and in partitioning the support critical IVHM network from flight and mission critical elements    A notional CHAPS-HM application of these technologies is shown in Figure 8.  Data from an accelerometer and oil debris monitor is processed locally in the Integrated Drive Generator \(IDG\y a partitioned IVHM processing element. The results as well as necessary raw data sets \(e.g to support maturation\municated using a transceiver to the Generator Control Unit \(GCU\ia the CHAPS enabled cable. Similarly, the GCU is equipped with a partitioned processing element and a transceiver. It performs appropriate processing on local GCU data as well as the data/results from the IDG and communicates the results to a Maintenance Computer routing around the flight critical Vehicle Management Avionics using the split ring connectors and jumper cable. The CHAPS enabled cables provide chafing detection for power cables running to the power distribution unit as well as data cables. Chafing detection is performed by the transceivers periodically and the results reported via the above network. In fashion similar to the above, power cables exiting the power distribution unit could be CHAPS enabled to both detect chafing and communicate IVHM data from subsystem powered by a particular cable  In this example, the I DG and GCU are health-ready subsystems; i.e., a partitioned processing element has been built into each unit, as well as an interface for communicating IVHM data. Thus, CHAPS-HM concept can provide a means to network health-ready subsystems throughout a platform and provide chafing detection/protection for both power and data cables 5  CHAPS  G ROUND AND F LIGHT TESTS  The initial flight testing approach was developed based on inputs from NAVAIR who sponsored the CHAPS technology development. Boeing was a subcontractor to KMM in executing the testing. The test approach defined was the following  Installation Locations In the early phases of the contracted development it was decided, with mutual agreement \(NAVAIR, Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing and Boeing\hat a flight test program of the CHAPS elements could be completed at least cost \(least development cost for test hardware\y initially utilizing            Fi g ure 8\226 Notional CHAPS-HM A pp lication Integrated Drive Generator 225 Accelerometer 225 Oil Debris Monitor      To Power Distribution Unit Generator Control Unit Vehicle Management Avionics Maintenance Computer Interface To IVHM Ground Processing  CHAPS Enabled Cable Optical Fiber Jumper Integrated Drive Generator 225 Accelerometer 225 Oil Debris Monitor          To Power Distribution Unit Generator Control Unit Vehicle Management Avionics Maintenance Computer Interface To IVHM Ground Processing   CHAPS Enabled Cable Optical Fiber Jumper   Figure 7 \226 Breadboard of OPDR  Figure 6 \226 Breadboard of OPDR 


  5 ground based test equipment to interrogate the fiber optic sensors on a post-flight basis. This would allow use of offthe-shelf laptop computers and only involve developing the 223ground based\224 Optical Time Domain Reflectometry units and associated software as well as connectors and other cable components for testing to \223mate with\224 the aircraft installed sensor cables.  A two step plan was initiated, with the support of both fixed and rotary wing PMA offices at NAVAIR as follows   225  One Fixed Wing Fighter F/A-18F Super Hornet at NATC Pax River, MD. The F/A-18 was chosen because it is widely used in the Navy and a common platform for NAVAIR and Boeing  225  Rotary Wing Platform Sikorsky CH-53E Sea Stallion. The CH-53E was chosen to support a rotary wing flight test   The F/A-18F flight test program occurred between 22 August 2004 and 19 September 2006. At the completion of the full flight test program for the F/A-18F aircraft the installed CHAPS cables had accumulated the following data thru May 12 2006 only 200  206.8 Flight Hours 200  139 Flights 200  24 Catapult Launches 200  42 Arrested Landings  Complete results of the flight test program were documented in a NAVAIR Report.

  6 Timing the duration of the ground tests was not a stated objective of the test plan, and was not tracked for the early test events. As the program ma tured, it became desirable to track the time required to collect the data since it was showing itself to be a significant factor Figure 12 summarizes the average data gathering time \(i.e. time from the first data trace measurement to the last, including moving from one test connector to the next\he different data acquisition equipment configurations used. These times do not include aircraft preparation time, data acquisition equipment setup or take-down times, or aircraft close up time; which were not tracked, but were consistent independent of the data acqui sition equipment configuration used. For the final ground test, an innovative data acquisition equipment interface configuration \(our third utilizing optical splitters, was used in an attempt to significantly reduce testing time since it was becoming a significant factor  The following observations can be made from the Figure 12 data  1\The testing time required for the manual probe and patch panel data acquisition equipm ent interface configurations were comparable to each other, given a two person test team and given the probe interface to be working well, which was not always the case 2\A two person test team was beneficial in reducing testing time, compared to one person, when using the manual-labor intensive confi gurations \(manual probe and patch panel 3\ent interface configuration was 4 times faster than either the manual probe or patch panel configura tions, given a two person test team. Being a much less manual-labor intensive set-up, it is unlikely a second person added much efficiency to the optical splitter method  The differences between the original test equipment arrangement and the final \223double ended\224 arrangement incorporating \223optical splitters\224 is depicted in Figure 13  Test Harnesses 226 One harness had an overbraid that included fiber optic cable and fiber optic connectors. The over-braid harness chosen for th e safety of flight tests was the APP Harness of the CH-53E aircraft and is the harness mounted around the outside of the plate shown in Figure 14 A second harness was modified with fiber optic sense shield known as the \223alternate embodiment.\224 The \223alternate embodiment\224 is a fiber optic wrap that can be wrapped around a wire harness and is secured by Velcro strips attached along the edges of the fiber optic wrap. It also includes a fiber optic connector or connectors. This 223alternate embodiment\224 harness was chosen as a test harness for the Results of Wi re Harness Fiber Optic Chafe Detection Safety of Flight Tests for CH-53. Aircraft Flight Demonstration safety of flight tests were completed for the APP harness and Main Rotor Pylon harness #10 of the CH53E aircraft. The Main Rotor Pylon Harness #10 is mounted in the middle of the plate shown in Figure 14  Summary of CH-53E Safety of Flight Results 226 The two representative harnesses did not suffer damage during safety of flight testing.

  7  6  CHAPS-HM  L ABORATORY T ESTS AND D EMONSTRATIONS  The Boeing Company has established an \221Operational Environment\222 facility for Integrated Vehicle Health Management \(IVHM\means develop and refine on- and off- vehicle health management technologies in a realistic environment.  A realistic environment includes sensors, subsystem \(target\ components, processors, and communication buses that are qualified for flight, or representative thereof.  Th e focus is to reduce risk associated with implementation, deployment and delivery of IVHM products. This Operational Environment is the venue for the development and evaluation of CHAPS technology  A number of CHAPS enabled cables were built to test the ability to send and receive data through fiber optic sensors The six foot long CHAPS cable shown in Figure 15 is used to carry pre-recorded IVHM data from one laptop computer to another  A serial port transceiver converts the electrical signal from the serial port of one laptop into photonic signals, the CHAPS cable is the transport medium, and another transceiver converts the photonic signal back to serial electrical communication, which is displayed on the second computer.  The transceivers we re selected based solely on convenience rather than performance or size.   This desktop 221system\222 proved to be perfectly capable of accurately conveying data at the maximum capability of the computers\222 serial ports, 128Kbit/sec  Another desktop evaluation explored more direct sensor data transfer.  A triaxial accel erometer was selected, and a small interface module applied to provide power to the accelerometer and convert its output to a serial data stream 115.2Kbits/sec\n, the serial to photonic transceiver converts this serial information and injects it onto the optical fiber of the test cable.  The second laptop computer was again able to receive accurate sensor data independently of the electrical content of the copper wire bundle.  This system is shown in Figure 16  7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This work by KMM and Boeing has prototyped a set of technologies that offer an affordable, low footprint approach to protect against wire chafing and as well as contribute to the implementation of CBM in legacy or new platforms  CHAPS protected cables have been incorporated as a normal part of aircraft wiring have shown and proven in the flight test programs described above to be very durable over time and flight conditions \(including F/A-18F flight environmental levels\de an affordable means of providing protection and detection of chafing where it has not been possible to do so otherwise.  In the larger view, the combination of CHAPS and CHAPS-HM technologies offer the following   Figure 15 \226 Sampling Rates of Health Management Data Sources  Figure 16 \226 CHAPS Enabled Cable Communicates Accelerometer Data   Figure 14 - Safety of Flight Test Harnesses 


  8 200  Affordable, low cost footprint technology to implement chafing protection and IVHM 200  Are attractive for applications where both chafing protection and IVHM support is needed 200  Relatively passive technologies that minimize certification costs 200  A high bandwidth network to communicate everything form raw sensor data to lower bandwidth processed data 200  A capability whose concept has been demonstrated in the laboratory  The integration of these technologies, to implement support critical communications of health management data onboard aircraft, requires considerati on of the required bandwidth and processing demands and the inherent wiring architecture of the host aircraft. The success of CHAPS/CHAPS-HM requires careful consideration as to the impact on maintenance, weight penalty and the value of the chafing detection and IVHM capability enabled. It is recognized that CHAPS/CHAPS-HM technology is not likely to be a comprehensive answer to low cost IVHM implementation by itself but offers value when used in situations \(e.g., cables associat ed with power distribution where the dual use nature of the technologies provide significant cost/benefit and/or offer value when coupled with other communications technologies \(e.g., wireless Future work will address the creation of hybrid communications networks to implement IVHM and on interfaces to health ready subsystems 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The development and testing of the CHAPS technology was supported by the NAVAIR Electrical Power Division Naval Air Systems Command, AIR 4.4.5.2 NAWC Patuxent River, MD.

EIS Architecture Design Task Implementation EIS Architecture Design tasks may be supported by existing tools [20]. Systems Modeling Language \(SysML 15] is considered as the most appropriate for EIS System Network model representation and requirement engineering, since it supports the concepts of requirements and resource allocation. As a direct consequence, SysML allows the representation of requirements as model elements which means that requirements are part of the system architecture. For representation purposes, a SysML pro?le for EIS System Network meta-model \(?gure 6 mented as a plugin to MagicDraw modeling tool [2]. In order to facilitate model exchangeability, EIS System Network model is being realized in XML, which is a standard exchangeable format. In order to exchange data with speci?c software tools, model transformations will be accomplished through appropriate XSLTs developed for each tool for example as the one transforming XMI to the EIS System Network document type description \(DTD 5. Case Study In the following we discuss the case of renovating a legacy information system supporting a large-scale public organization based on the proposed concepts. The organization supports more than 350 interconnected regional of?ces and its main purpose is to provide services to the public both citizens and businesses. Regional of?ces are divided into three categories according to their size and information infrastructure requirements \(large, medium and small More than 15.000 employees work in the organization having on-line access to the legacy system. There are more than 300 different services provided to the public, while each citizen is required to register in the one belonging to his/her residential area, called residential of?ce. Some of them require the actual presence of citizens in their residential of?ce Existing system architecture is based on a fat clientserver architecture. All application logic is programmed within the client platform, while data is distributed in local database servers located in each regional of?ce. A Central database is supported in the Datacenter for data synchronization and lookup purposes. The Datacenter and all regional of?ces participate in a private TCP/IP network to facilitate ef?cient data replication. Most data related to a speci?c citizen are maintained as local data in his/her residential of?ce. Client programs access the local database to store data, while they access the central database mostly for lookup purposes. Local data are asynchronously replicated in the central database using a transaction management system \(TMS Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 to facilitate communication with the central database. The central database provides the overall view of each citizen  s record 


record To enhance the level of services provided by the organization, we decided to establish an enhanced e-services environment through an e-government portal. The main target of the portal is to minimize the need for citizen  s presence in regional of?ces and intents to deal with all the drawbacks of the current e-service platform. It provides easy access to citizens and businesses twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. It also promotes the increase of e-services to users, facilitating the organization to accomplish its strategic goals. The portal facilitates on-line transactional services and ensures on-line access to the databases of the legacy information system Provision of transactional e-services re?ects the operation of the legacy system and thus results in its renovation. In order to effectively support both systems \(e.g the portal and the legacy system able to apply the same policies and minimize maintenance cost. Thus, it was decided to explore the renovation of the legacy information system by adopting modern technological trends, such as multi-tiered application architecture server-based computing and light clients. It was decided also to rewrite application code based on J2EE architecture to develop a web interface for the legacy information system in order to support a uni?ed environment for both the legacy system and the portal. This decision affected the legacy system architecture, described in System Network View. Some of issues raised included: \(a database architecture? It is currently distributed. Should it become centralized? What are the implications in the network infrastructure? \(b complished to minimize maintenance cost Though EA was never fully described, the organization had already decided to establish an EA based on Zachman framework a few years ago. RUPmethodology was used for software development, thus application description models were developed within Rational Rose platform. In order to be able to apply the proposed tasks identi?ed in section 4, relative information had to be extracted from the corresponding cells. Application description \(e.g. applications and modules tracted from corresponding Rational Rose ?les. Though the process was not automated, the provision of System Network meta-model, helped architecture designer to identify the information needed to obtain from software designers Detailed service description in terms of load requirements could not be extracted from software description. This was crucial in order to decide upon Intranet and Datacenter architecture. This information was collected by interviewing software developers The new system has to deal with a number of require&lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Small Regional Office oracle L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt tuxido L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt L.R.O. department tuxido Central

Topology View - Existing System ments, with security and availability being the most important ones. Security issues have to do with the security of the network, security of data, authentication control, etc. Availability requirements deal with the backup subsystem, the recovery system and high availability UPS. Privacy must be enforced with the use of cryptography and compression techniques. All these requirements were identi?ed during the System Architecture design process and consequently exported in System Motivation cell where all system requirements are gathered using a simpli?ed text-based requirement description method System Architecture design tasks were performed by existing tools already described in [20]. The existence of System Network meta-model and its implementation in XML facilitated tool integration and interoperability. The identi?cation of primary EIS engineering activities served by Zachman matrix rows and columns facilitated a better understanding between software developers, architecture designers and organization management and enhanced discrete methodology integration. Existing and renovated application architecture of the legacy system de?ned by Topology View are presented in ?gures 7 and 8 respectively. The screenshots are from the MagicDraw [2] tool, enhanced with EIS pro?le to provide the appropriate functionality 6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work MB-EISE process based on Zachman framework was explored in the paper. The designer may adjust basic MB-EISE activity model for each cell, formulate a methodology-independent EIS cell-related view, and ?nally identify methods and tools appropriate for implementing each speci?c task. One could argue that in such a case, 36 distinct EIS sub-views should be de?ned, each of them being rather complex, while basic MB-EISE activity should be adjusted 36 times, resulting in a very complicated process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Application Server lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt

Topology View - Renovated System However, EIS engineering process, as enterprise architecture, is itself complex. The bene?t of the proposed approach is that all aspects \(simple or complex form and modular fashion. Cell-related sub-views and corresponding meta-models, as well as cell-related MB-EISE activity model may be progressively formed according to the designer  s priorities and perspectives Having a black-box view of each Zachman cell, the proposed approach focuses on EIS view integration and interview consistency. The notion of external entities when de?ning EIS cell-related views provides the means for interoperability with external cells, while at the same time facilitates atomicity within the limits of each cell. We are currently emphasizing Business and System rows, and especially Function and Network cells, exploring in parallel Motivation column and the way non-functional requirements are managed Having a white-box view of each Zachman cell, it is evident that the de?nition of a technology neutral metamodel and the identi?cation of basic engineering tasks, corresponding to EIS cell-related views, contributes to the integration of different methodologies and tools. A library of EIS System Network models has been already implemented in XML.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
