sampling probability is known which means that 015 i;j will be constant for any given f i j g  we can still use the sample counts to reliably estimate similarity Details For a transaction T t we can visualize the pairs in T t 002 T t as a 2-dimensional table with rows and columns sorted by support where we are interested in the pairs below the diagonal index i  j  Since f is non-increasing the sampling probabilities are decreasing in each row and column This means that for any k  0  in time O  j T t j  we can determine what interval in each row of the table is to be sampled with probability 2 000 k  To produce the part of the sample for one such interval we describe a method for producing a random sample of S  f 1      036 g  for a given integer 036  where each number is sampled with the same probability p  Since p\036 may be much smaller than 036  we want the time to depend on the number of samples rather than on 036  This can be achieved using a simple recursive procedure similar to the one used in ef\002cient implementations of reservoir sampling With probability 1 000 p  036 we return an empty sample Otherwise we choose one random element x from S  and recursively take a sample of the set S nf x g with sampling probability p  The set S can be maintained in an array where sampled numbers are marked In case more than half of the numbers are marked we construct a new array containing only unmarked numbers the amortized cost of this is constant per marking To select a random unmarked number we sample until one is found which takes expected O 1 time because no more than half of the numbers are marked In summary for each sampling probability 2 000 k we can compute the corresponding part of the sample in expected time O  j T i j  z k   where z k is the number of samples This is done for k  1  2      2 log nm   Sampling probabilities smaller than  nm  000 2 are ignored since the probability that any such pair would be sampled in any transaction is less than 1 m  That is with high probability ignoring such pairs does not in\003uence the sample To state our result let 2 000 N denote the set of negative integer powers of 2 Lemma 4 Let  f  N 002 N  2 000 N be non-increasing in both parameters Given a transaction T t and support counts j S i j for its items in expected time O  j T t j log nm   z  we can produce a random sample of z 2-subsets of T t such that 017 f i j g is sampled with probability  f  j S i j  j S j j  if  f  j S i j  j S j j    nm  000 2  and otherwise with probability 0  and 017 the samples are independent 016 For all similarity measures in 002gure 1 and any feasible value of 034  the minimum support requirement will ensure that the expected number of samples in a transaction is at most j T t j  This means that for each transaction T t  the time spent is O  j T t j log nm  with high probability B SampleCount This phase sees the stream of pairs generated by the pair sampling and has to 002lter out as many low similarity pairs as possible while successfully identifying high similarity pairs By the properties of pair sampling this is essentially the task of identifying frequent pairs in the stream of samples We aim for space usage that is smaller than that of standard algorithms for frequent item mining in a data stream In order to accomplish this we use a modi\002cation of an algorithm by Demaine et al Their algorithm 002nds frequent items in a randomly permuted stream of items and so does not directly apply to our setting where only the transactions are assumed to come in random order Demaine et al are able to sample random elements by simply taking the 002rst elements from the stream This would not work in our setting where all these elements might be pairs coming from the same transaction Reservoir sampling Instead we use a reservoir sampling method W e sk etch the mechanism here and we refer to the original paper for a complete description Suppose we have a sequence of d items and we want to sample a random subset of the sequence We 002rst of all put in the sample the 002rst s elements that we see For each subsequent element in position t  s  we will put it in the sample with probability s=t  When a new element has to be included in the sample another one that is already part of the sample has to be evicted Each element of the set of samples will be chosen as the victim with probability 1 s  This technique ensures we will end up with a set of samples that is a true random sample of size s  SampleCount We consider the stream of pairs divided into 024 chunks The pair sampling generates these chunks such that each chunk corresponds to some set of transactions i.e all the pairs sampled from each transaction end up in the same chunk We run reservoir sampling on every other chunk to produce a truly random sample of size s 2  We then proceed to count the occurrences of the elements of the sample in the next chunk Assume in the following that we number chunks by  024   such that reservoir sampling is done on evennumbered chunks indexed by  024 even   When doing the above whenever we see a pair f i j g whose count must be updated we weigh the sample by the factor 015 i;j that got lost during the pair sampling phase so as to consider an expected number of samples exactly proportional to s  i j   At the end of a counting chunk we estimate the similarities of all pairs sampled and keep the s 2 largest similarities seen so far At the end of the stream the similarity estimates found are returned to supersede the previous estimates Pseudocode for the SampleCount algorithm is shown in 002gure 1

Looking at j S k i  S k j j we can write Pr j S k i  S k j j\000j S i  S j j  2 024 j 024 016 j S i  S j j  2 024  024 2 001 e 000 j S i  S j j 016 2 6 024 2 We use the fact that Chernoff bounds also holds for negatively dependent random variables Since the last bound is the weakest of the three the lemma follows We want GP i;j to hold with probability 1 000 o 1 n 2  whenever items i and j both have support   From Lemma 6 we get that this holds if j S i  S j j  C\024 log n  for some constant C depending on 016  If s  i j   2 024Lf     025 024L then j S i  S j j 025 2 024L  Hence a suf\002cient condition for the similarity is s  i j   024L  3 It remains to understand what is the probability that given a good permutation the pair sampler will take a number of samples for a given pair in each chunk k that leads to a 1 006 016  approximation of s  i j   We denote the latter event by GBS i;j;k  and want to bound the quantity Pr[GBS i;j;k j GP i;j   For this purpose consider the random variable X i;j;k de\002ned as the number of times we sample the pair f i j g in chunk k  Assuming GP i;j we have that over the randomness in the pair sampling algorithm E  X i;j;k  016;L   f  j S 1 i j  j S 1 j j  034 j S i  S j j  2 024  Since the occurrences of f i j g are independently sampled we can apply a Chernoff bound to conclude X i;j;k 016;L  E  X i;j;k   This leads to the conclusion Lemma 7 X i;j;k 016;L   f  j S 1 i j  j S 1 j j  034 j S i  S j j  2 024 016 Suppose that X i;j;k is close to its expectation Then we can use it with 1 006 016  approximations of j S i j and j S j j  to compute a 1 006 O  016  approximation of s  i j   This follows by analysis of the concrete functions f of the measures in Figure 1 A suf\002cient condition on the similarity needed for a 1 006 016  approximation of X i;j;k can be inferred from lemma 7 If s  i j  025 4 024L=\034 then E  X i;j;k  025 s  i j  034  4 024 025 L  So it suf\002ces to enforce s  i j  025 4 024L=\034  4 In order to have O  mb  pairs produced by the pair sampling phase we will choose 034  4 M  The expected number of pair samples from T t is less than j T t j 2 034 f      using that f is decreasing For all measures we consider f     024 1   so j T t j 2 034 f     024 j T t j 2 M 024 j T t j  It remains to understand which is the probability that a pair of items each with support at least   is not sampled by SampleCount Let the random variable X k represent the total number of samples taken in chunk k  The probability that a f i j g is sampled in chunk k is X i;j;k X k  so the probability that it does not get sampled in any evennumbered chunk is Q k 2  024 even  1 000 X i;j;k X k  s  We have seen before that X i;j;k 016;L 025 s  i j  034  4 024  For what concerns X k using a Chernoff bound we can get X k 016;L  E  X k  024 mb=\024  using the linear upper bound on the number of samples So we can compute Y k 2  024 even  1 000 X i;j;k X k  s 024 022 1 000 s  i j  034 024 2 024\015 i;j mb 023 s\024 2 024 022 1 000 s  i j  034 4 mb 023 s\024 2 024 C exp 024 000 s  i j  034 s\024 8 mb 025 In order for this probability to be small enough  O 1 m 2   we need to bound the similarity to s  i j  025 8 mbL s\024\034 5 To choose the best value of 024 we balance constraints 3 and 5 getting 024L   mbL s\024\034  024  r mbM s 6 From which we can deduce s  i j   L  max  r mbM s  M   7 V D ATASET CHARACTERISTICS We have computed for a selection of the datasets hosted on the FIMI web page 1  the ratios between the number of occurrences of single items and pairs in the 002rst half of the transactions and the total number of occurrences of the same items or pairs The values of some of this ratios the most representative are plotted 002gure 3 on the x axis items or pairs are spread evenly after they have been sorted according to their associated ratio The y axis represents the value of the ratios We have taken into account only items and pairs whose support is over 20 occurrences in the whole dataset in order to avoid the noise that could be generated by very rare elements As we can see the number of occurrences and co-occurrences are not so far from what would be expected under a random permutation of the transactions The synthetic data set behaves exactly like we would expect under a random permutation with the ratio being very close to 1  2 for almost all items/pairs This means that even for real data sets where the order of transactions is not random the sampling probabilities used in the pair sampling are reasonably close to the ones that would be obtained under the random permutation assumption VI C ONCLUSIONS We presented the 002rst study concerning the problem of mining similar pairs from a stream of transactions that does rely on the similarity of items and not only on the frequency of pairs A thorough experimental study of carefully engineered versions of the presented algorithm remains to be carried out 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
