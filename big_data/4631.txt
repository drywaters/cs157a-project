Data quality plays a crucial role in data analysis, because the incorrect data leads to wrong decisions Nowadays, improving the data quality manually is very difficult and in many cases is impossible as data quality is one of the complicated and non-structured concepts and data refinement process can not be done without the help of professional domain experts, and detection and correction of errors require a thorough knowledge in the related domain of the data. Thus, the necessity of using \(semi methods is discussed to find data defects and errors and solve them. Because data mining methods are designed to discover interesting patterns in datasets we can use them efficiently to improve different dimensions of data quality. In this paper, a new method is presented to measure the accuracy dimension of data quality using fuzzy association rules. Finally Experimental results of the proposed method show the effectiveness of the proposed method to find incorrect values in datasets Keywords-data quality; data mining; fuzzy association rules I  I NTRO DUCTION  W idespread use of data and decisions based on data analysis focuses on data quality in todays business success Nevertheless, a study by the Meta group reveals that 41% of projects based on data analysis will be failed. As one of the main reasons, they identified insufficient data quality leading to wrong decisions [1 Therefore, traditional methods of cleaning data can be used r arely. It is normally infeasible to guarantee data quality by manual inspection, especially when data are collected over long periods of time and through multiple generations of databases. Therefore, \(semi-\matic data cleaning methods have to be used [1         Since the early 90s, knowledge discovery in databases KDD\en introduced as a well established field of research, and over the years new methods together with scalable algorithms have been developed to analyze efficiently very large datasets. Unfortunately most of the orientation is towards the particular and theoretical problems The application of data mining methods to improve data quality is a relatively new and promising approach from research and usage viewpoint and can present new domains of their application outside the domain of pure data analysis   Data quality studies have been accomplished using data mining methods. For example, Hipp and et al proposed developed an algorithm to extract association rules for data cleaning in which they ranked deviation from these rules based on confidence of violated rules [3   In addition, Brodley and Friedl used data mining in preprocessing data in the process of knowledge discovery in database. By filtering the probably incorrect training data they can significantly reduce th e misclassifications, while their goal is to improve final classification accuracies, not detection of errors in training data cus an d Ma let ic used different methods of data mining which include statistical methods, clustering, pattern-based methods and ordinal association rules for automatic error detection in real dataset. Their experiments showed that ordinal association rule is more efficient than the other methods, but it is appropriate only for the datasets whose lots of their attribute type is decimal or  Grüning showed that classifiers can be used in detection of conflicts in datasets and gave practical recommendations for data correction.  This approach uses support vector machines as a classification algorithm   In this paper fuzzy association rules are used to enhance the data quality. The structure of this paper is as follows Section 2 presents an introduction of data quality and different dimension of data quality. In Section 3, the data mining and its application for improving data quality is stated, and in Section 4, the proposed method is explained The experimental results of proposed method have been given and analyzed V1-468 Volume 1 2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering \(ICEIE 2010  C 978-1-4244-7681-7/$26.00      2010 IEEE 


II  D ATA Q UALITY  Definition of data quality depends on the considered purpose, so there is no unique definition which can be stated formally.  In literature, "appropriate for use" or "to meet end user needs" are used.  According to the general definition of quality management, we define quality of data to meet customer needs. Contrary to popular belief, the quality is not necessarily error at the level of zero [7 a ta wi ll h a ve high quality if they are appropriate for applications, decision making and planning Researches have defined different dimensions for data quality. Each dimension shows a particular view of quality The more interesting dimensions are as follow   Accuracy: the distance between value of v and value of  v that represents the entity which v tries to portray it   Completeness: the database includes all of the related entities   Update: the rate of fast updating of data   Consistency: the rate of violation from the defined significant rules on the dataset   Availability: the rate of data availability, being easy and the speed of data retrieval   Timeless: over the time some of information looses its credit. For example, information about the address of person at the time of entrance is completely correct and has enough quality but just this information would loose its credit over the time   Value added: the rate of being useful Different dimensions of data quality are not independent of each other, and there may be a direct or indirect relation between them [6  In this paper, the accuracy dimension has been considered III  D ATA M INING AND I TS A PPLICATION IN D ATA Q UALITY I MPROVEMENT  Data mining is an automatic process to extract the patterns as an implicit knowledge in the database. Data mining utilizes multiple scientific fields simultaneously such as the technology of data base, artificial intelligence machine learning, neural networks, statistics, pattern recognizer, knowledge based systems and information retrieval In 2001, Hipp introduced data quality mining as a new approach from research and application viewpoint. The goal of data quality mining is to employ data mining methods in order to detect, quantify, explain and correct data quality deficiencies in huge databases Generally, four important aspects are considered in data quality mining  a  Employment of data mining methods to measure and explain the data quality deficiencies  b  Employment of data mining methods to correct deficient  data  c  Extension of knowledge discovery process models to reflect potential of data quality mining d  Development of specialized  process models for pure data quality mining IV  T HE P ROPOSED M ETHOD  Among data mining methods, association rules is a very active research topic that has been used widely in lots of cases such as basket analysis, decision maker support systems, theft detection, etc. Data quality is also one of the topics where using association rules can be useful, because   In comparison with other methods of data mining association rules are understandable and can clearly discover and describe the dependency between data    Association rules are independent of each other Therefore, recision of simpler rules has no effect on the other rules    The applications of association rules have proved its usability in data quality. The evaluations done in  t h a t associ atio n r u les can i m p r ove data  quality   In [3  a m e thod has b e e n pr ese nt e d  w h i ch uses  association rules to discover error of transactions. In this method, rules and patterns available in data are initially discovered via Apriori algorithm. Then, each of the transactions is compared with discovered rules and any deviation from rules will be marked as error. In this method discovered association rules have a very important role in error detection One of the defects of presented method in tha t association rules can not show properly the associations between quantitative values. As an example in Table I occupation and education are categorical attributes and income is numerical attribute. If we want to obtain association rules in these data with support >1, via Apriori algorithm, only we can find some BS degrees, whereas there is an association between income and occupation or education and income. For example, some one who have a high educational level have more income than the people who have a mean educational level. Apriori algorithm is not capable of discovering such associations between quantitative values. As much of data in real world contain quantitative values and there may be errors in this type of values, the proposed method in [3  can not be an ap p l i cab l e  to detect error. In this paper, the presented met l be extended and association rules between quantitative values will be discovered with the help of fuzzy sets concept A  Fuzzy Association Rule Fuzzy association rules are the rules which are extracted from a fuzzy dataset. A fuzzy rule in the form of B A   where A  B are fuzzy sets and 0   B A is called fuzzy association rule Using of fuzzy concepts has some advantages. First, the discovered association rules are more understandable. These concepts make a transition between numerical values of data and categorical concepts. Second, these concepts help discover the rules between quantitative values. For example V1-469 Volume 1 2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering \(ICEIE 2010 


the following fuzzy sets are defined for the data shown in Table I High occupational level = {manager, deputy Mean occupational level = {designer High educational grade = {PHD, MS Mean educational grade = {BS, 12th High income = {500-700 Mean income = {200-300  TABLE I  I NSTANCE D ATABASE  Occupation Income Education Transaction_id designer 200 BS 1 designer 250 BS 2 designer 300 12 th  3 manager 500 PHD 4 manager 550 MS 5 deputy 600 PHD 6  The following fuzzy association rules may be stated by the mentioned fuzzy sets High occupational level High educational grade Mean occupational level Mean educational grade High occupational level High income Mean occupational level Mean income  Now assume the following transaction Transaction_id 7: occupation= deputy, education= PHD income =200 Considering the dataset shown by Table I, an error can be detected in the above transaction, as the person who is deputy cannot have income of 200, while his income is expected to be much higher. This transaction violates "High occupation level High income" fuzzy rule. It should be noted that the error would not be detected by the rules extracted by Apriori algorithm B  proposed framework The proposed framework is consisted of steps shown in figure 1              Figure 1  Proposed framework The description of each step is as follows a  Data preprocessing in this step, data is converted to standard format and lost values are managed. For example the values of date attribute in some transactions may be in the form of YYYY/MM/DD and in some other in the form of YYYY-MM-DD. To obtain a correct model of the associations, implementation of this step is necessary  b  Mapping data to fuzzy values fuzzy sets and fuzzy membership functions for quantitative data are defined in accordance with the knowledge of experienced experts Then, data values are mapped to fuzzy values by fuzzy membership functions. Table II shows fuzzy mapping for income and occupation attributes of Table I  TABLE II  M APPING T ABLE I TO F UZZY V ALUES  Mean income High income Mean occupational level High occupational level Fuzzytrans _id 1 0 1 0 1 0.98 0.01 1 0 2 0.90 0.02 1 0 3 0.08 0.85 0.03 0.95 4 0.04 0.90 0.01 0.95 5 0.03 0.93 0 1 6   c  Fuzzy  association  rules  extraction Fuzzy association rules are extracted, via the presented algorithm in  whic h all a ttr ibutes are weight ed e q u a lly I n this  step, the rules with high confidence level are considered Thus, rule set R is limited to     012     r confidence R r R where  is the minimum confidence Table III shows some extracted rules from Table II  TABLE III  F UZZY A SSOCIATION R ULES E XTRACTED FROM T ABLE II Confidence Fuzzy association rule 0.52  High occupational level High income  0.41  Mean occupational level Mean income    d  Consistency check of transactions with discovered rules the consistency of transactions with discovered rules is checked in this step. Each of transactions may violate some rules and may be consistent with other rules. Also, it may not fire some of the rules. Let R be the set of fuzzy association rules and Let D be the database of fuzzy transactions. Let Y X r   be a Fuzzy association rule and X  be membership function of X the mapping that determines whether a fuzzy transaction D T 012 violates a rule R r 012 is defined as   015        else satisfy rule T satisfy rule T if T R D Violate Y X Y 0 _   _     1  1  0          rule_satisfy parameter is the threshold for fuzzy rule satisfaction  Database Data preprocessing Mapping data to fuzzy values Association rules extraction Consistency check of transactions with discovered rules Scoring and ranking the transactions V1-470 Volume 1 2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering \(ICEIE 2010 


In \(1   1 T Y   shows the degree that fuzzy transaction T  violates r the more   1 T Y   the more inconsistency of transaction T with rule r  As an example, the consistency check for transaction 6 is shown in Table IV  TABLE IV   C ONSISTENCY C HECK FOR TRANSACTIONS 6 WITH R ULES IN T ABLE III   Inconsistent rule  Consistent rule  Non-correlated rule  Fuzzytrans_id _ High occupational level High income  Mean occupational level Mean income 6    e  Scoring  and ranking the transactions In order to assign scores to the transactions, the highest confidence of violated rules will be assigned to the corresponding transaction. Then the transactions are sorted in descending order. It is well-worth mentioning that the highest confidence of violated rules is not only simple and acceptable measure, but also eliminates extra calculations Because, if a rule is violated by a transaction, there will be no need to check rules having confidence less than violated rule  V  E VALUATION R ESULTS  In this section, proposed method is evaluated and the results are compared with presented method  All t h e evaluations have been implemented on a system equipped with Core 2 Duo 2.26 GHz CPU, 3GB RAM and Win 7 Usually for evaluating the performance of information retrieval and classific ation algorithms, precision and recall measures are used. These measures 3 based on the confusion matrix entries, shown in table V. In this paper, in addition to these two measures, the runtime of the two methods has been also compared   TABLE V  C ONFUSION  MATRIX  Transactions classification by proposed method    Incorrect transactions  Correct transactions  FN  TP  Correct transactions  Real Classification  TN  FP  Incorrect transactions   Precision  FP T P TP  2 Recall FN TP TP  3  In order to evaluate the proposed method, Adult dataset from UCI has been used. This dataset includes two numerical attributes called income and hpw and two categorical attributes called occupation and education. 1000 instances of the transactions of this dataset have been selected and manipulated to make imitation  errors. Then proposed method and the pres en are applied to the manipulated dataset. In the tests related to precision and recall min_support  min_confidence and min_rule_satisfy  are considered to be 0.2, 0.7 and 0.4, respectively   0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0 20 40 60 80 100 Number of Error IN Dataset Precision Fuzzy Association Rule Apriori  Figure 2  The precision measure for the proposed method and the method described in  Figure 2 compares the precision of the proposed method with the method proposed ter m s of nu m b er o f  created errors in dataset. The figure shows that the proposed method outperforms the method proposed in as lot s  o f  the association between quantitative data in dataset are not discovered by Apriori algorithm and play no role in transactions ranking. Some attributes values are in a range which causes rules support would not be satisfied \(above example\. Precision curves have wavy shapes, because any change in data causes a change in the support of rules which can affect their detections. Figure 5 also compares the recall measure for the two methods. It is clear that the proposed method delivers better results In the evaluation related to runtime  of the two methods min_support parameter has been changed to 0.05 in order to discover more rules by both algorithms. According to figure 4, runtime for the proposed method is better. The main reason is due to the difference in runtime  of association rules discovery algorithm and ranking the transactions Fuzzy association rules algorithm is much faster than Apriori algorithm, because Apriori algorithm must check all of the numerical and categorical data in the dataset to find frequent itemsets. Also, it should find the support of each of itemsets which is time consuming due to variety of numeric values. While fuzzy association rules algorithm only works with the fuzzy sets whose numbers are more limited.  The ranking of transactions, based on highest confidence of violated rules, needs fewer computations, because when a V1-471 Volume 1 2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering \(ICEIE 2010 


transaction violates a rule, there would be no need to check rules having confidence less than that of violated rule      0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 20406080100 Number of Error In Dataset Recall Fuzzy Association Rule Apriori  Figure 3  The recall measure for the proposed method and the method described in  0 40 80 120 160 200 240 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 Number of Transactions RunTime\(second Fuzzy Association Rule Apriori  Figure 4  The runtime for the proposed method and the mothod presented    VI  C ONCLUSION  Automated data quality improvement is a necessity for finding incorrect data in large databases. In this paper, a method based on data mining approaches is presented to improve data quality. This papers proposed approach for data quality improvement uses fuzzy association rules, by which hidden rules in datasets will be discovered. Then, the consistency of transactions with these rules is checked and a score is assigned to each transaction. This score generally shows inconsistency of a transaction with the rules set. In the proposed method, high scores are assigned to the transactions which are suspicious to have defects. Users knowledge on suspicious transactions and background knowledge about data will be used in the process of determining the accuracy of transactions and ultimately total quality of dataset. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method  R EFERENCES  1  D. Luebbers, U. Grimmer, M.

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
