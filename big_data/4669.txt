Efìciently Extracting Frequent Subgraphs using MapReduce Wei Lu 1 Gang Chen 2 Anthony K.H.Tung 1 Feng Zhao 1  National University of Singapore  Zhejiang University 1  luwei1,atung,zhaofeng  comp.nus.edu.sg 2 cg@cs.zju.edu.cn Abstract Frequent subgraph extraction from a large number of small graphs is a primitive operation for many data mining applications To extract frequent subgraphs existing techniques need to enumerate a large number of subgraphs which is superlinear with the cardinality of the dataset Given the rapid growing volume of graph data it is difìcult to perform the frequent subgraph extraction on a centralized machine efìciently In this paper we investigate how to efìciently perform this extraction over very large datasets using MapReduce Parallelizing existing techniques directly using MapReduce does not yield good performance as it is difìcult to balance the workload among the compute nodes We therefore propose a framework that adopts the breadth rst search strategy to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs i.e all frequent size i 1 subgraphs are generated based on frequent sizei subgraphs at the i th iteration using a single MapReduce job To efìciently extract frequent subgraphs we propose an isomorphism-testingfree approach by properly maintaining how frequent subgraphs are mapped within each graph Extensive experiments conducted on our in-house clusters demonstrate the superiority of our proposed solution in comparison with the baseline approach I I NTRODUCTION As a primitive operation frequent subgraph extraction has a wide range of applications in data mining such as extracting frequent patterns from chemical compounds identifying the relationship between chemical compounds and building graph indexes to facilitate subgraph containment queries 21  2 Gi v e n a dataset D consisting of a set of graphs a subgraph s is deìned to be frequent if the number of graphs in D containing s is not less than a frequent threshold The majority of existing work adopts a pattern-growth approach 1 6 7 13 that typically applies the depth rst search strategy to extract frequent subgraphs Figure 1 shows an overview of how a pattern-growth approach works Initially by extracting every distinct edge from the graphs it is easy to identify all frequent size-1 subgraphs Starting from a certain frequent size-1 subgraph s  s is then recursively extended until all frequent subgraphs containing s are generated An extension over a frequent subgraph s is to append an edge from some vertex of s  and the new generated subgraph is called a child of s  In Figure 1 the extension order for the offsprings of s 11 is s 21 s 31 s 32 s 22  Subsequently the remainder of each frequent size-1 subgraph is extended one by one in the same manner Note that a frequent sizei subgraph  i 1  might be generated by multiple size i  1  subgraphs To avoid redundant extensions one typical solution   s 1n     s 1i s 11 s 2l s 2i s 21 s 22  Size-1 subgraphs Size-2 subgraphs s 31 s 32 Size-3 subgraphs Fig 1 An Overview of Pattern-growth Approaches is to deìne a global order for the subgraphs and each sizei subgraph is always generated by its smallest size i  1 subgraph For example suppose S 11 is the smallest size-1 subgraph and hence all size-2 subgraphs that contains s 11 will be only extended from s 11  In this way we can imagine that the cardinality of the offsprings rooted at different subgraphs with the same size is rather skewed and a smaller subgraph usually has more number of offsprings Regarding these approaches it is necessary to maintain considerable mappings from frequent subgraphs to graphs that contain them while the number of mappings is superlinear with the cardinality of the dataset Considering the AIDS Antiviral Screen 1 dataset consisting of only 43,905 chemical compounds these pattern-growth approaches including gSpan  Mof a 1 FFSM 6 7 and Gston 13 consume 300MB 600MB 1.2GB and 1.3GB memory usage respectively when the frequent threshold is set to 5 of the cardinality of the dataset Consider the fore v e r increasing data size For example SCIFinder 2  which provides the worldês largest collection of chemistry and related science information reports that about 4,000 new compound structures are added each day It is not appropriate to employ these in-memory patterngrowth approaches and somehow difìcult to perform frequent subgraph extraction on a centralized machine efìciently MapReduce w a s recently proposed as a programming model for supporting data intensive applications in a distributed computing environment It has gained wide acceptance and been applied in various application domains due to its simplicity exibility fault tolerance and scalability It therefore 1 http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/docs/aids/aids data.html 2 http://www.cas.org 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 639 


is a good platform for extracting frequent subgraphs over large graph datasets In this paper we focus on how to design and implement a solution that enables fast and scalable frequent subgraph extraction using MapReduce A baseline approach to achieving parallelism directly using MapReduce is to assign each compute node to process the same number of size-1 frequent subgraphs and generate the other frequent subgraphs based on them However it does not yield good performance as it is difìcult to balance the workload among the compute nodes We observe that the number of frequent subgraphs generated in different compute nodes is rather skewed and the majority of frequent subgraphs are generated based on very few size-1 subgraphs Such unbalance is caused by the generation scheme in the pattern-growth approach for avoiding redundant extensions To alleviate this problem an alternative is to re-assign the children of these subgraphs to other compute nodes However such re-assignment is challenging since we do not know how many frequent subgraphs can be generated based on a given subgraph in advance Regarding the baseline approach it is challenging to balance the workload by assigning the frequent subgraphs to compute nodes To tackle this imbalance issue we propose a framework called MRFSE M  apR  educe based f  requent s  ubgraph e  xtraction to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs using breath rst search and apply the generation-and-veriìcation mechanism over the graphs at each iteration The generation task takes each graph g as the input and generates size i 1 subgraphs for g based on all frequent sizei subgraphs that g contains With the help of existing technique including the minimum DFS code in and CAM in 6 we can obtain a unique key that is a sequence for all isomorphic subgraphs Therefore the veriìcation collects each frequent size i 1 subgraph from the generation task by counting the number of the same keys In our case the cost of generation task is obviously more expensive than that of the veriìcation task Therefore we propose a strategy on how to assign graphs to compute nodes so that they could take similar generation cost In this way we can balance the workload over each compute node Simply applying the generation-and-veriìcation mechanism may involve two MapReduce jobs one for the generation task and the other for the veriìcation task However too many MapReduce jobs could incur considerable overhead of writing the intermediate results In our case we use only one MapReduce job Speciìcally the generation task involves the map phase only In the map function it takes the ID and all frequent sizei subgraphs of a graph g as the input and generate a superset of all frequent size i 1 subgraphs of g  The veriìcation task involves the reduce phase only In each reduce function it collects all isomorphic size i 1 subgraphs by the same key Although the number of MapReduce jobs is reduced it is more difìcult to balance the workload using a single MapReduce In our case as a graph is always processed by the same compute node during the entire iterations we need to guarantee that each mapper processes similar generation computation at each iteration while the graphs are assigned to the compute nodes before the rst iteration We demonstrate that our proposed strategy on how to assign graphs to compute nodes is effectiveness to balance the workload in this case To efìciently produce size i 1 subgraphs in the generation task we propose an isomorphism-testing-free approach by properly maintaining how frequent subgraphs are mapped within each graph In our design at the i th iteration for each graph g  we maintain mappings from frequent sizei subgraphs that g contains to g  These mappings for each graph are generated at the  i  1 th iteration Based on the mappings we propose an extension based approach that is similar to patterngrowth approaches but without any isomorphism testing operations to generate size i 1 subgraphs for each graph In summary we make the following contributions  We propose framework MRFSE to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs All frequent size i 1 subgraphs are extracted at the i th iteration using a single MapReduce job We also propose a strategy on how to balance the workload in term of the generation cost  We propose an isomorphism-testing-free approach for the generation task by properly maintaining how frequent subgraphs are mapped within each graph  We conduct extensive experiments on our in-house clusters to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed solution in comparison with the baseline approach The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section II discusses related work Section III introduces the necessary background knowledge and provides the problem deìnition Section IV describes an overview of the framework Section V presents the extension of existing techniques to generate new subgraphs in our framework Section VI reports the experimental results and Section VII concludes the paper II R ELATED W ORK Frequent subgraph extraction is a well studied research area in the centralized systems Existing work that extracts frequent subgraphs exactly can be broadly classiìed into two categories Apriori-based approaches 9 and patterngrowth approaches 1 6 7 13 Apriori-based approaches iteratively extract the frequent subgraphs using breath rst search At the i th iteration  i  1  all frequent size i 1 subgraphs are generated by joining two frequent sizei subgraphs Since a new subgraph can be generated by multiple pairs a graph isomorphism testing  is required to remove duplicates Finally each distinct subgraph is veriìed whether it is frequent by counting the number of occurrences in the graphs of the dataset using subgraph isomorphism testing  Although Apriori-based approaches also use breath rst search the difference between our framework and them is two-fold First we take each graph as the process unit while the latter take each frequent subgraph as the process unit Second our framework employ a isomorphism-testingfree approach to generate new subgraphs Apriori-based approaches have considerable overhead for join and isomorphism testing operations Therefore most of existing work applies 640 


pattern-growth approaches to extract frequent subgraphs The most widely used pattern-growth approaches is gSpan in which the authors introduce a novel coding technique to restrict the extensions for each frequent subgraph from partial vertexes Besides it also provides a novel mechanism to avoid redundant extensions to generate the same frequent subgraphs gSpan has been widely used to extract frequent subgraphs in graph index construction techniques 3 2 Other pattern-growth algorithms such as MOFA FFSM 6 SPIN and GAST ON 13 adopt v arious coding techniques and optimization strategies to reduce the enumeration space There are also quite a few studies on extracting frequent subgraphs using disk-based algorithms In W ang et al propose an index structure called the ADI to support a disk-based extension for existing techniques However for processing large scale graph data the cost of deserializing graphs from external storage to main memory still contribute to a bottleneck according to our experiment Recently there is a rapidly growing trend to design and implement graph algorithms in the distributed graph-parallel systems including Pregel GraphLab 10 etc These systems regard each vertex in the graph as the process unit The vertex can receive/send messages from/to the neighbors and modify its own status based on the received messages In particular these systems are mainly designed for the applications involving implicit or explicit dependencies among the process units such as PageRank and shortest path computation However in our application scenario we extract the frequent subgraphs from a large number of small graphs Each graph is taken as the process unit and there does not exist any dependency among different graphs Therefore the reason of not using Pregel-like system is two-fold First our problem is embarrassingly parallel which can be efìciently supported by MapReduce Second MapReduce shows better performance than Pregel and GraphLab in our scenario As the mappers and reducers do not need to communicate with each other in the process MapReduce reduces the cost of synchronizations Besides there exists extensive amount of work that aims to implement the typical database operators via MapReduce framework including theta-join multiway join and similarity join 16 11 All of these w ork is orthogonal to our work III P RELIMINARIES In this section we rst formally describe the problem deìnition and then present a brief review of gSpan T able I summarizes the notations used throughout this paper A Frequent Subgraph Extraction For ease of presentation we model each complex structure as an undirected labeled graph Typically a labeled graph g is able to be represented as a quadruple  V g E g L g l g  in which V g is the set of vertices E g is the set of undirected edges L g is a set of labels and l g is a labeling function that maps every vertex and edge to a single label in L g Given a graph g  we use l g  v  to denote the label of vertex v and TABLE I S YMBOLS AND D EFINITIONS  Symbols Deìnitions D a collection of graphs g a graph in D V g the set of vertices in g E g the set of edges in g g.ID the graph identiìer of g in D l g

and subgraph s s.D an ID list of graphs in D containing s T the frequent threshold F i all frequent sizei subgraphs in D F g i subgraphs in F i that a graph g contains l g  u v  to denote the label of edge  u v  connecting vertices u and v in g  For sake of brevity let g.id represent the identiìer of graph g  Given two graphs g and s  we can verify whether s is a subgraph of g i.e g is a supergraph of s or g contains s  by performing subgraph isomorphism  which is deìned as follows Deìnition 1 Subgraph Isomorphism   Given a graph s  V s E s L s l s  and a graph g  V g E g L g l g   s is said to be subgraph isomorphic to g denoted as s  g f and only if there exists an injective function f  V s  V g such that 1  v  V s  we can have f  v   V g  and l s  v  l g  f  v   2   u v   E s  we can have  f  u  f  v   V g  and f s  u v  f g  f  u  f  v   A A A B B B 0 1 2 3 4 5 a a c b a a a a g 1 D A C B a a a 0 1 2 3 A a E a 4 5 b g 2 A B B 0 1 2 a a a c g 3 Fig 2 An Example of Subgraph Isomorphism Example 1 Subgraph Isomorphism Figure 2 shows an example of three undirected labeled graphs According to Deìnition 1 we can nd that g 3  g 1 since there exists an injective function f   0  0  1  1  2  4   while g 3  g 2  Particularly given two graphs s and g if s  g and  V s    V g   then we say s is graph isomorphic to g  That is graph isomorphism is a special case of subgraph isomorphism Deìnition 2 Embedding Given a subgraph s and a graph g  suppose s  g and f  V s  V g is an injective function that satisìes the requirements in Deìnition 1 An embedding e is a sequence of vertices in V g that are mapped to the vertices of V s using f  i.e e  f  v 1  f  v i  f  v  V s    where 641

embeddings in g 1 shown in Figure 2\(a for them respectively In practice an embedding acts like an injective function Given a subgraph s and a graph g  we can build a unique subgraph g s e in g based on an embedding e such that g s e is graph isomorphic to s It enables us to fast identify all isomorphic subgraphs to s in g by maintaining all these possible embeddings A subgraph s is called connected if for any two vertices u v  V s  there exists a path from u to v in s  Given a graph collection D and a subgraph s  the posting list of s is deìned as an ID list of graphs in D containing s  i.e s.D   g.id  g  D s  g   Given a subgraph s  s is said to be frequent if  s.D  T  where T is called frequency threshold which is a user-deìned number In many applications users are more concerned with the frequent recurring components of graphs  Hence in this paper  w e focus on identifying the frequent subgraphs that are connected Problem Deìnition Given a graph collection D and a frequency threshold T  the problem of frequent subgraph extraction is to identify all connected subgraphs which are contained in at least T graphs of D  In the remainder of this paper a subgraph that we mention is connected Additionally we F i to denote all frequent sizei subgraphs in D and F g i to denote the frequent sizei subgraphs that a graph g contains Trivially F g i  F i Given a sizei subgraph s  we say s  is a child of s when s  s  and  E s    i 1  similarly we say s  is a parent of s when s   s and  E s    i  1 An enumeration operation of a sizei subgraph s is to enumerate all children of s by appending one edge from every vertex in V s if possible B gSpan and the Minimum DFS Code gSpan is the most widely used approach to e xtract frequent subgraph in the centralized systems As a pattern-growth approach it was proposed with two common objectives i avoiding redundant enumeration for the same subgraph and ii reducing the enumeration spaces during the extension of frequent subgraphs by appending all possible one edges Order Sequence 0,1,A,a,B 1,2,B,a,C 1,3,B,a,D 3,4,D,a,A 3,5,D,a,E 0 1 2 3 4 Fig 4 An Example of DFS Code To tackle both problems gSpan proposes DFS coding technique to translate each subgraph into a sequence of DFS codes Each DFS code is an edge sequence generated by performing a depth rst search DFS on the edges of the subgraph i.e edges in the DFS code are ranked by the discovery order in the DFS search Accordingly each vertex in the subgraph is also marked by its discovery order In the DFS coding technique an edge in the DFS code is represented by a 5-tuple  i j l s  i  l s  i j  l s  j   where l s  i  l s  i j  l s  j  are the labels of vertex i  edge  i j   and vertex j in the subgraph s  respectively We show a DFS code consisting of ve ordered edges in Figure 4 for the graph g 2 shown in Figure 2\(b Since there exist multiple depth rst search trees for a given subgraph s  s can have many DFS codes Therefore a lexicographic order is used so that every two DFS codes can be compared with each other Lemma 1 Minimum DFS Code  Given a sizei subgraph s  let parent  s  min be its parent in F i  1 with the minimum DFS code Then s generated by parent  s  min takes the minimum DFS code Initially each frequent size-1 subgraph is generated with its minimum DFS code This generation is able to be implemented by scanning the dataset once The minimum DFS codes of other frequent subgraphs are able to be generated based on Lemma 1 By introducing the minimum DFS code technique gSpan is able to avoid redundant enumeration and restrict the extension of a frequent subgraph in a proper way Lemma 2  Redundant Enumeration Elimination  Given a frequent subgraph s  children of s will be enumerated if and only if it takes the minimum DFS code Lemma 2 eliminates redundant enumeration for the other isomorphic subgraphs in order to avoid many unnecessary computations Consider the graph g 2 shown in Figure 2\(b as an example Subgraph 0  3  5 of g 2 can be extended from either 0  3 or 3  5  Since subgraph 0  3  5 that has been extended from 3  5 does not take the minimum DFS code no enumeration is required in this case On the other hand the same subgraph extended from 0  3 takes the minimum DFS code and hence enumeration of all its children will be performed by extending one edge In this manner we can ensure that enumeration for all isomorphic subgraphs is executed only once Lemma 3  Enumeration Restriction  Given a f r equent subgraph s associated with the minimum DFS code suppose L and R are the last and rst discovery vertices in the depth rst search Let P R  L be the path from R to L  We enumerate children of s by appending one edge in one of the following two cases 1 backward extension from L to a vertex in P R  L  2 forward extension from a vertex in P R  L to a new vertex Lemma 3 restricts the enumeration of a frequent subgraph by extending one edge from its partial vertices instead of the complete vertices For example enumerating children of g 2 shown in Figure 2 constrains the extension of edges from vertices 0 3 5 We use Enu  s  to denote the children of s by extending one edge using Lemma 3 After generating all distinct size-1 subgraphs the details of extracting all frequent subgraphs and their posting lists based on each size-1 subgraph 642

gSpan D F s   are shown in Algorithm 1 A baseline approach to parallelizing gSpan 3 using MapReduce is to partition all frequent size-1 subgraphs to reducers evenly and run Algorithm 1 in each reducer Although the baseline approach is easy to implement it has two drawbacks On the one hand it causes the load skew problem among the reducers The extension space for deriving the frequent subgraphs is not evenly distributed Typically the majority of frequent subgraphs are generated based on very few frequent size-1 subgraphs with the smallest minimum DFS codes This is because for a new generated frequent subgraph s based on the other frequent size-1 subgraphs we often do not need to enumerate s according to Lemma 2 On the other hand when the dataset cannot be held in main memory each enumeration of a frequent sizei subgraph to size i 1 subgraphs incurs a large number of deserializing operations by loading the graphs into main memory resulting in an I/O bottleneck IV O VERVIEW OF THE F RAMEWORK In order to overcome the limitations of simply parallelizing gSpan-like approaches we propose a framework called MRFSE M  apR  educe based f  requent s  ubgraph e  xtraction to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs using breadth rst search i.e at the i th iteration  i  1  we identify F i 1 and their posting lists Figure 5 shows the overview of the framework at the i th iteration Typically our framework employs a generation-and-veriìcation mechanism at each iteration using a single MapReduce job The generation involving the map phase only aims to generate a superset of F i 1  which is shown on top of Figure 5 In the map function the input key is a graph ID and the input value is a superset of frequent sizei subgraphs that this graph contains In our design each sizei subgraph s is associated with a set of embeddings from a graph g  which are used to facilitate generation of new size i 1 subgraphs from s  In what follows we assume that a subgraph is associated with a set of embeddings whenever there is no ambiguity in our discussion We generate size i 1 subgraphs contained in g based on these sizei subgraphs Details of how to generate size i 1 subgraphs for each graph is presented in the next section Since a frequent size i 1 subgraph cannot be generated based on a non-frequent sizei subgraph before 3 Although we focus on gSpan algorithm the baseline approach can easily be extended to any other pattern-growth approach proceeding the generation we lter all non-frequent sizei subgraphs of g based on F i  which is shown on bottom of Figure 5 and highlighted in the rectangle with a dashed line In our case F i is generated at the  i  1 th iteration and pre-loaded in the map setup phase at the i th iteration The output key and output value in the map function are the graph ID and the newly generated size i 1 subgraphs To enable the iterations the output of the map phase at the i th iteration is taken as the input of that at the  i 1 th iteration Obviously union of size i 1 subgraphs generated in all graphs constitute a superset of F i 1  Lemma 4  Given subgr aphs s 1  s 2  if the minimum DFS codes of s 1 s 2 are equal then s 1  s 2 are graph isomorphic Based on Lemma 4 all isomorphic subgraphs take the same minimum DFS code that is a sequence of vertex and edge labels in essence Therefore a straightforward approach veriìes size i 1 subgraphs generated in the map phase as follows By shufîing each pair minimum DFS code  size i 1 subgraph graph ID   to the reducers in each reduce function we collect each frequent size i 1 subgraph by counting the number of graph IDs with the same minimum DFS code and build the posting list of graph IDs for this subgraph However in this way it incurs unnecessary I/O and communication overhead in that we have to shufîe a large amount of embeddings associated with subgraphs while these embeddings are useless for the veriìcation To tackle this problem we decompose the output in the map function into two parts The rst part consists a pair graph ID size i 1 subgraph which is then taken as the input of the map phase at the  i 1 th iteration The second part highlighted in the rectangle with a dashed line consists a pair minimum DFS code graph ID which is then taken as the input of the reduce phase Clearly in this way we can save both I/O and communication cost by omitting the embeddings The above iteration goes on until no further frequent subgraphs are generated In order to utilize the MapReduce framework to support parallel computation we split the dataset into partitions at the beginning and each partition will be held and processed by a separate mapper during all the iterations Regarding the generation-and-veriìcation mechanism used in our framework an important observation is that that the cost of generation task is obviously more expensive than that of the veriìcation task it only counts the graph IDs in the reduce function Therefore we balance the workload in term of the generation task A straightforward approach to partitioning the graph dataset is to apply random partitioning i.e randomly assigning graphs to different partitions In this way each partition could take the approximately equal number of graphs However this approach may incur load imbalance among mappers Imagine an extreme case that size of all graphs in one partition are very large while that of graphs in the other partitions are small Clearly the mapper that involves in this partition will take expensive generation cost and contributes to a bottleneck As described in the next section our generation scheme is based on the extension of edges Therefore we 643

1 subgraphs and their embeddings of g 1 in Figure 2 are shown on top of Figure 6 Next given a subgraph s and all its embeddings in g  we shall discuss how we can enumerate all children of s by appending one edge in g efìciently Consider an example by taking s 11 shown in Figure 6 as s and g 1 in Figure 2 as g  According to Lemma 3 we rst identify the vertices in path P R  L for s  which are vertex 0 labeled with A and vertex 1 labeled with B  Since there exist only two vertices we do not need to perform the backward extension We begin from the vertex 1 of s to conduct the forward extension by appending a new edge Since we have already identiìed all embeddings in g for s  we sequentially check the vertex v in each embedding e where v in g s e is mapped to vertex 1 of s  Speciìcally we rst collect all frequent edges which start from v but not contained in g s e  and append the edge one by one For example for embedding 0  emphasized in yello w o f embbedings of s 11 in Figure 6 starting from vertex 1 we can append edges 1  5  1  4  1  2  based on which three new size2 subgraphs are generated and the corresponding embeddings are highlighted in yellow in the gure Similarly we can perform the forward extension for the other embeddings associated with the same subgraph After extending one edge from vertex 1 we perform with the forward extension from the vertex 0 of s  For embedding 0  we append one edge 0  4 that starts from 0  A new size2 subgraph is generated and the corresponding embedding is highlighted in black and the complete extension for s in g is shown at the bottom of Figure 6 Lemma 5 Isomorphism-free Veriìcation Given a subgraph s with an embedding e  and another subgraph s  with an embedding e  if  E g s e    E g s  e    and   i j   E g s e   i j   E g s  e   then g s e and g s  e  are the identical subgraphs Therefore s is graph isomorphic to s   To avoid unnecessary enumeration of the same subgraphs we need to remove redundant subgraphs with non-minimum DFS code Take the subgraph s 12 shown in Figure 6 as an example By appending edge 3  5 for embedding 2 we can generate a subgraph s with embedding 2 3 Although we can perform either a graph isomorphism testing of s on the generated subgraphs or a minimum DFS code veriìcation of s  these two operations are expensive In practice we can verify whether s is a redundant subgraph simply based on Lemma 5 For example by constructing the subgraph from embedding 2 3 5 o f s  we nd that it is identical to the subgraph constructed from embedding 5 3 2 o f subgraph s 23 shown in Figure 6 Hence s is subgraph isomorphic to s 23  and we do not need to enumerate s  According to Lemma 1 for each subgraph s  s generated by parent  s  min takes the minimum DFS code Hence we rank the subgraphs in F g i in the ascending order of their minimum DFS codes When a subgraph is veriìed as a duplicate based on Lemma 5 we can safely discard this subgraph and its embeddings since the associated DFS code is not minimum After ranking and enumerating all 1-subgraphs we can detect the  Algorithm 2 E-Enumeration F g i  1 F g i 1   genG   2 sort subgraphs of F g i in the ascending

cache with 1GB size to buffer the graph data ii MRFSE-J and iii MRFSE-E extract frequent subgraphs using MRFSE framework and generate new subgraphs using join-based and the extension-based enumeration respectively We conduct the experiments over a real dataset PubChem 5  PubChem contains one million chemical structures Each graph has 23.98 vertices 25.76 edges 3.5 distinct vertex labels 2.0 distinct edge labels on average and the total number of distinct vertex labels and distinct edge labels is 81 and 3 respectively The size of PubChem dataset is 434 MB We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches in terms of running time and I/O cost Since the input at each iteration is the output at the previous iteration for simplicity we only collect the output at each iteration as well as the original data size To compare the efìciency and the effectiveness of our proposed framework we adjust the maximum size  maxL  of the frequent subgraphs in  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16   the

partitioning and 2 equal size partitioning The results are shown in Figure 7 We can observe that performance of using equal size partitioning strategy is better than that of using random partitioning in both MRFSE-J and MRFSE-E This is because in both extendedbased enumeration and join-based enumeration we generate new subgraphs in term of edges Therefore the workload can be more balanced among the compute nodes if we partition the data based on edges In the remainder of experiments we employ equal size partitioning strategy to partition the data We then compare the performance of proposed algorithms and show the results in Figure 8 We only show partial results of the Baseline approach for sake of clarity since the running time is 57,713s even when the maximum size is just 5 We observe that MRFSE-J and MRFSE-E are signiìcantly faster than the Baseline by two orders of magnitude because of 5 http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Running Time \(s

two major reasons First Baseline has the severe load skew problem We observe that the majority of frequent subgraphs are generated based on very few frequent size-1 subgraphs with many recursions while the others stop much earlier with less number frequent subgraphs Moreover although the cache is able to alleviate the repeated reading the graphs from the disks deserializing process of a graph is time consuming and is executed millions of times As we can see from Figure 8 MRFSE-J incurs less I/O cost This is because given a graph g and a subgraph s  MRFSE-J maintains only one embedding of each subgraph sg in g that is graph isomorphic to s while MRFSE-E maintains all possible embeddings of sg  However MRFSE-E performs better than MRFSE-J in that the cost of join operation is more expensive than that of extension operation 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 10 20 30 40 Running Time \(s of Compute Nodes Baseline MRFSE-J MRFSE-E  a maxL 5 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 10 20 30 40

speedup more accurately we omit the cost introduced by the MapReduce framework itself i.e the time of running MapReduce without any computation We observe that the performance of Baseline remains almost the same in that the reducer generating the maximum number of the frequent subgraphs becomes the bottleneck The running time of MRFSEE and MRFSE-J decreases when the reducer number varies Nevertheless there is an obvious trend of diminishing returns We show the results for extracting all frequent subgraphs in Figure 9\(b which follows the same trends We study the performance of MRFSE by varying the frequency threshold Figure 10 plots the number of frequent subgraphs the size of their posting lists and the cost of MRFSEJ and MRFSE-E Curves with different symbols demonstrate the

Threshold observe that the number of frequent subgraphs rst increases exponentially and then increases smoothly after an inîection point emerges This is because frequent subgraphs with smaller size tend to have many extensions that are then able to be veriìed as frequent subgraphs as well Nevertheless frequent subgraphs with larger size may not have many valid extensions with respect to the frequency threshold The position of the inîection point relies on the frequency threshold Generally a small frequency threshold leads to a larger inîection point Another interesting nding is that the number of frequent subgraphs drops superlinearly when we enlarge the frequency threshold Not surprisingly the size of their posting lists shown in Figure 10\(b follows the same trends to that of the number of frequent subgraphs The running time and the I/O cost for both MRFSE-J and MRFSE-E follow the same trends When reducing the frequency threshold we can nd that the running time in MRFSE-J increases more signiìcantly than that in MRFSE-E while the I/O cost is the exact opposite VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we studied the problem of efìciently supporting frequent subgraphs extraction in a distributed environment particularly using the MapReduce framework We presented a framework called MRFSE to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs on a MapReduce like platform such as Hadoop We introduced a equal size partitioning strategy in order to balance the workload We proposed an isomorphismtesting-free approach for generating new subgraphs by properly maintaining how frequent subgraphs are mapped within each graph Extensive experiments conducted on our in-house clusters demonstrate that the techniques built using proposed framework are scalable and efìcient A

  12 Moreover no mature chart API was found even though a beta version of a library named aFreeChart was used successfully and works pretty well Finally, the Google Map application provided with the Android system was used to display the satellite ground track 7  C ONCLUSION  The development of IMIS server and desktop client ended in November 2011. Since late 2011, IMIS has been deployed in the MSL payload control center and has been integrated into SSALTO. Operators, science teams, and experts from CNES and French/American laboratories involved in the MSL project have a very good feeling about the software IMIS meet the requirements of two different missions \(Earth observation and Mars exploration\ that at a first glance are supposed to have distinct operational procedures to monitor the instruments. This was possible because IMIS was designed as a generic software that provides the base functionalities and an extensible architecture MICROSCOPE and SWOM are the next missions that intend to use IMIS in their payload control centers [13   Technologies and software design concepts are now mature and allow to implement distributed Web architecture. In terms of information system security, no specific difficulty was encountered. The lessons learnt are to consider upstream the security constraints. In most of cases it is sufficient to apply the state of the art in matter of security network segmentation and isolation, system hardening, and application security \(use of security guidelines and best practices from CNES and partners: authentication, traces and security logs, restricted privileges, input/output data checking, etc The smartphone application is currently in the last stages of development. A prototype was developed in 2011 and presented to end-users. It has validated the operators\222 interest in a mobile application that allows to remotely monitor the payload instruments. IMIS android application has raised a lot of interest and its use is now being considered for the MSL mission IMIS offers new functionalities and possibilities for on-call operations that have been requested by operators for a long time. However, as it is not yet used in an operational context, there is currently no lesson learnt about the real advantage of using such a tool.  Moreover, the deployment of the smartphone client requires further analyses: definition of security procedures relative to professional usage of smartphones, modification of the operational procedures because the way on-call operations are realized, is modified with such an interactive tool that provides means to remotely analyze and acknowledge alarms, etc R EFERENCES    Wi en s et al 2012  T h e C h e m C a m I n s t r u m e n t Su i t e  on the Mars Science Laboratory \(MSL\Rover: Body Unit and Combined System Tests.
