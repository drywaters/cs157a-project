 I NTRODUCTION  Residents travel survey is an important work of OD survey in transport planning. It is a kind of basic information which must be collected in transport planning. As a basis of traffic demand forecasting and traffic plan establishment, it is also used to optimize existing urban public transit network and establish a project. In sum, it plays an important role in urban integrative and special transport planning Sample rate of residents travel OD survey usually arranges from 3% to 5%, but it is always different in zones due to some factors which canít be controlled, and the data of this survey are also with particularities. On the basis of data mining technology, using a small quantity of sample 
data to reckon the characteristics which present general rules can actualize. The information will be formed by analyzing the data of residents travel survey, discovering the relations and then giving them certain signification and association The information provides something significant of data, but it is often unrelated to decision-making and canít be consider as the basis. The more useful information, what is called knowledge, can be obtained only by further analysis The ability to make use of such knowledge has become the key factor to successful decision-making. Using data mining technology, people can recognize the potential value of existing data and find some valuable information hidden in the data   T h er e f o r e  da t a m i ni ng t e c hno l o gy ha s be e n  
widely concerned and become the forefront of research directions in the field of database and information decisionmaking. Association rules mining can discovery the association or relations among the items in a large quantity of data. It is an important issue in data mining and has been extensively studied in recent years This paper used the data of residents travel survey in Fuzhou as a data set. After the pre-processing, the relativity of residentsí travel mode choice characteristics and influencing factors were found by using association rules algorithm. As a result, some meaningful rules were found which can guide the formulation of transport policy II  ASSOCIATION  RULES  
AND  APRIORI  ALGORITHM Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman or Times New Roman may be used. If neither is available on your word processor, please use the font closest in appearance to Times. Avoid using bit-mapped fonts if possible. True-Type 1 or Open Type fonts are preferred. Please embed symbol fonts, as well, for math, etc Data association is a kind of knowledge in database which can be discovered. The certain regularity between values of two or more variables is called association. It can be divided into simple association, temporal association and causal association. The purpose of association analysis is to identify the association network hidden in the database[2 3   
A  Basic Concepts Suppose I 1 i  2 i  001\002  m i is data item set, D is the set of total exchange T, and D T 002  Association rules mining is to find dependence relations which fulfill the qualifications from the transaction database D. The terms of every record in D are items, and the object of association rules mining is the rule among items such as Y X 000 002 support=s 002 confidence=c Some important indexes of association rules are given as follows  
 Support: the support of rule 002Ù\001\027\002 in transaction set D is the ratio of the number of transactions including 002 and 002 to the number of total transactions, which is represented by support 002Ù\001\027 002 i.e. support   D D T T Y X T Y X    003 002 004  005    Confidence: the confidence of rule 002Ù\001\027\002 in transaction set D is the ratio of the number of 
transactions including 002 and 002 to the number of transactions including X, which is represented by confidence 002Ù\001\027\002 i.e. confidence 002Ù\001\027\002    D T T X T D T T Y X T 003 002 003 002 004         Expected confidence: it describes the support of data item set Y without influence of data item set X

which is represented by E- confidence 002 i.e 002  confidence 002   D D T T Y T    003 002    Lift: lift is the ratio of confidence to expected confidence. It describes the influence of data item set X on data item set Y, which is represented by lift 002 001\027\002 i.e. lift 002Ù\001\027\002 confidence 002Ù\001\027\002  confidence 002 If the lift is larger, the influence degree of data item set X on data item set Y is larger Generally speaking, lift of useful association rules is above 1. If the confidence of association rules is larger than expected confidence, it illuminates that appearance of X promotes the appearance of Y, and it also illuminates the relativity between them. If lift is not above 1, the association rules are out of meanings B  Apriori algorithm Given a transaction set D, association rules mining is to form a association rule with support and confidence which are larger than min-support and min-confidence. If the rule fulfills thresholds of min-support and min-confidence, it is called strong rule. Min-support expresses the minimum degree that a data item set should meet in the statistical sense And the min-confidence is the one that association rules must satisfy, which is defined by user. It represents the minimum reliability of association rules. If the support of data item set is above or up to min-support, the set is called frequent item set or large item set Agrawal\(1993\esigned a basic algorithm Apriori which is based on the idea of two phases frequent item set The design of association rules mining algorithm can be divided into two sub-issues   Identify all of large item sets which are existing in database: First calculate Candidate 1 ñ item set \(kitem set is a set containing k items\d then find the frequent 1 ñ item set; according to the frequent 1 item set, determine the candidate 2 ñ item set and then find frequent 2 ñ item set, ..., and so on, until there is no candidate item. The last set is the large item set   According to the rules and confidence, use large item sets to produce strong rules III  CASE  ANALYSIS A  Description of the problem When dealing with residents travel survey data, it is not only to statistically analyze the travel characteristics of residents, but also to consider the knowledge hidden in resident survey data lists. The knowledge is often based on the synchronous appearance probability of several survey indexes, that is, when the index "travel purpose = work appears in a range, the probability of the index "travel mode bus" appears in another range \(or the association among multiple indexes\. Knowing these relations, the relations of indexes will be found. It provides a basis to analyze issues on the view of relations. The study method of relations among residents travel characteristicsí indexes is to analyze concretely using association rules. Viz. change the quantitative data into Boolean association based on specified min-support and min-confidence defined by user interface Carry out data mining by computer in order to get the association rules of various indexes and travel modes B  Data Preparation This paper took information records of residents travel survey in Fuzhou in 2008 as database Fuzhou is the capital of Fujian Province, which is famous as the country's historical and cultural city. It is an important trade center of Chinese southeast coast, a modern port city In recent years, the society and economy of Fuzhou developed rapidly. With the increasingly growing of urban population, conflicts of urban traffic were acute. As the basis of transport planning and building, residents travel survey was put forward [5  R e s i den t s tr av el s u rv ey in Fu zh ou w a s  conducted in 2008, which collected more than 5,000 survey samples. The resident travel survey data were list in table 1 The values of indexes express the options, and the definitions of indexes were in table2 C  Data Processing Using neural network to preprocess survey data, it was found that the influence of the seven indexes, travel mode in common use, purpose, work, income, quantity of bicycle holding, family monthly payment of traffic, age, on the choice of travel modes were larger than those three indexes residence, feeling of urban traffic, and gender.. Importance degree of each index was shown in figure1  Figure 1  Importance degree of each index Therefore, choosing the seven indexes proposed to analyze characteristics of group in each travel mode. Flow chat of association analysis is shown in figure 2 Because the data of travel modes such as taxi, private car regular bus, and electric bike were very few, this paper mainly analyzed the characteristics of four kinds of travel modes: walking, bike, bus and motorbike. The results were list in table 3 The model training used more than 5,000 residents travel survey samples, and in the model training, the minconfidence was 60%, min-support was 3%. So the confidence of rules calculated by the model was larger than 60%, and the support was larger than 3%. The rules were valid

  Figure 2  Flow chat of association analysis D  Analysis From table 2 we can conclude that   The meaning of Rule 1 is: the residents who chose travel mode ì5î\(i.e. motorbike\ were basically workers, the ages of them arranged from 20 to 39 and they had a certain income. The confidence of this rule is 66.50%, with high credibility. That is, the possibility of worker, whose age was between 20 and 39, income between 100 thousand and 300 thousand, to travel by motorbike is 66.5%. At the same time, the ratio of number of records which measured up the rule to the number of survey samples was 7.5%, i.e. among the 5000 samples there were 375 residents measured up the rule. The confidence of data samples was high   Rule 2 illustrated there were 63.8 percents of residents, who usually traveled by motorbike and family monthly payment of traffic was among 50 yuan and 100yuan, chose motorbike as their travel mode. 3.1 percents of samples measured up this rule i.e. 155 samples supported this rule   Rules 3 and 4 showed that the main transport instrument of residents with travel mode 3 \(i.e. bus was bus. The number of samples supported this rule was 710, and the confidence was also larger than 60%. Most of these residents were in the vicinity of downtown, and more convenient to travel by bus Because most of companies and factories in Fuzhou moved from urban areas to suburb, such as Mawei Qingkou and so on, the workers didnít hold bikes as transport instrument, so bus system become their main travel mode   The family monthly payment of traffic for residents who chose travel mode 2 was almost below 50 yuan and their income was low. Of course, some of them were students or workers who lived nearby. Rule 5 showed if the family has 2 bikes, they might go to work by bike with the possibility of 67.4%. 595 samples supported this rule, which were 11.9% of the total samples. Rule 6 showed employees whose annual income less than 0.1 million inhabitants, and between the ages of 20-39, would choose bike as their transport instrument with the possibility of 66.7%, 425 samples supported this rule, which were 8.5% of the total samples   Rule 7 referred to some residents shopping on holidays, their travel purpose was shopping, and their annual income was below 0.1 million, while the family monthly payment of traffic was less than 50 yuan. Consider the support and confidence 485residents met this rule, which was 9.7% of the total samples and with high confidence 72.60 002 So the traffic issues aroused due to larger number of people in some lively, bustling area should be concerned   Rule 9 referred to some elder people, most of them chose walking as their primary travel mode and it was also a relatively large proportion. Therefore accessibility design for the elder should be concerned in transport planning IV  CONCLUSION As information technology develops continuously, data mining has also been widely used. Using data mining to analyze residentsí travel characteristics, the universal characteristics can be calculated by the small amount of sample data, so as to guide the transport planning and design more effectively. In this paper, neural network was used to filter the indexes of residentsí travel characteristics analysis in order to reduce the larger deviation made by man-made factors, and then used association rules to analyze the characteristics. The characteristics of each travel mode were clearly showed by relative rules, which is of great practical significance in guiding transport planning A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by a grant from the Research Program of Department of Education in Fujian Province No. JB06202 R EFERENCES  1  WANG Guang-hong, JIANG Ping.

   Table 4. Normalized Criteria Comparison Table In AHP   Reusability Meeting Operational Requirements Meeting project Deadline Reusability 0.157 0.148 0.272 Meeting Operational Requirements 0.789 0.744 0.636 Meeting Project Deadline 0.052 0.106 0.090  Table 3 and Table 4 show the weight values of the three criterions as compared to each other using the AHP process. These weights have been decided by the stakeholders after discussions among themselves Average weights can be derived from Table 4 as follows Reusability- 0.193 Meeting Operational Requirements- 0.724 Meeting Project Deadline- 0.083 These weights represent the priority of each criterion on a scale of 0 to 1  5.3. Argumentation Tree  We develop argumentation tree for each and every alternative separately. The ar guments are stated by stake holders and assembled under the alternative but they target a specific cr iterion. These arguments can either be supporting or attacking each other or their respective alternative nodes. We present three figures, where each figure represents the argumentation hierarchy for one alternative. Rectangular boxes represent the alternatives with the name of the alternative under it. Ovals represent the criteria with their descr iption. The arguments are specified by labels èAê, èBê, èCê for alternative çAdobe flashé, çAdobe Directoré and çOpen GLé respectively Along with the labels, the arguments also have indexes associated with them. Beneath the labels are two boxes The box on left shows the weight of the argument whereas the box on right shows the priority of the stakeholder who specifies the argument  Once the argument has been sp ecified, the user enters its weight. We first reassess the weights of the arguments using priority reassessment discussed in h e n us ing the techniques specified in [11 w e red u ce t h e arg u m e n t s  to a single level. Finally, the weighted summation of the arguments with the criteria weights helps us evaluate the final weights for the decision matrix. It is important to note here that, the aggregation method used for calculating the favorability is a weighted summation  The three argumentation hierarchies for the three alternatives are presented in the Figures 7, 8, and 9. The diagrams contain arguments, their weights and the stakeholderês priorities     Figure 7. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Flash   Figure 8. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Director 150 


     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
