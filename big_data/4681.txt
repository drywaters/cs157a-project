The big data being generated on Twitter daily, and its significant impact on social networking, has motivated the application of data mining analysis\ extract useful information from tweets. In this paper, we analyze the impact of tweets in predicting the winner of the recent 2013 election held in Pakistan. We identify relevant Twitter users, pre-process their tweets, and construct predictive models for three representative political parties which were significantly tweeted, i.e., Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf \(PTI Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz \(PMLN\, and Muttahida Qaumi Movement \(MQM\. The predictions for last four days before the elections showed that PTI will emerge as the election winner which was actually won by PMLN. However, considering that PTI obtained landslide victory in one province and bagged several important seats across the country, we conclude that Twitter can have some type of a positive influence on the election result, although it cannot be considered representative of the overall voting population  Keywords\227Pakistan, Election 2013, Winner, Twitter, Big Data Analysis, Predictive Analytics I  I NTRODUCTION  Twitter is a well-known micro-blogging website which currently allows millions of users to inter-connect through voiced opinions, in the form of fixed-length textual statements called tweets. Although not strictly defined, Twitter has the concept of user communities related to different types of discussion topics, e.g., politics, education, research entertainment, humor, domestic is sues etc. The field of Social Network Analysis has concentrated particularly on the detection of such communities and an analysis of their tweet flow, particularly regarding the opinions and sentiments of users. In fact, considering that around 540 million tweets are being generated daily w i tter beco m e s a perfect application for big data analysis \(data mining\ regarding the extraction of the generic public opinion on the diverse discussion topics. These opinions can positively impact different types of crucial objectives related to strategic management, governmental policies and reforms, product brand and retail management, customer relationship management, operational optimiza tion  4 5 6    An interesting application of Twitter analysis is focused on politics, e.g., gauging the sentiments of users regarding the current government\222s policies, or the most favorable candidate or political party\ to win an upcoming election. Usually near to or prior to the election date, the users tweet about their favorite candidate and their opponents. Some tweets highlight the events happening around the elections that could be useful in determining the public opinion of the users, the problems they face, the challenges they have, and the hopes that they attach to the future elected government  The days around May 11, 2013 were quite eventful for the Pakistani users on Twitter, as Pakistan\222s General Elections were held on this date for the 2013-2018 tenure [9 T h es e elections represented the full-term completion of one democratically elected government and transfer of power to another one. We observed a significant tweeting rate on this topic starting from January 2013 uptil the election date  In this paper, we focus on Twitter to analyze the relevant Pakistani Election-based tweets, from January 2013 till 7 th  May, 2013. Our goal is to determine the election winner based on Predictive Analytics techniques and we selected Twitter because of its previous use in election opinion analysis and electoral prediction in different co untries   13  1 6  s ee S ection II f ter  m o n itoring of t w ee ts it was  revealed that three political parties were more significantly tweeted as compared to others, i.e., Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf PTI\, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz \(PMLN\d Muttahida Qaumi Movement \(MQM\e categorized the tweets as either in favor of \(Pro\or against \(Anti\iven party. After carrying out the relevant tweet processing steps removal of unnecessary information\, we employed Predictive Analytics to learn decision trees o r each political party with the Rapid Miner data mining tool. We then employed these trees to accurate ly predict the election winner based on tweets of 8 th May, 9 th May, 10 th May and 11 th May Although the results showed that PTI will emerge as the election winner, the actual overall winner was PML-N while PTI won comprehensively in the Khyber Pakhtunkhaa province and in several other constituencies. In other words Twitter can have some type of a positive influence in the electoral results, but it cannot be considered completely representative of the voting population 


50  This paper is structured as follows. Section II explores work related to Twitter big data analysis for electoral prediction and other applications. Section III elaborates our tweet gathering and preprocessing stages that form a vital component before any analysis activity. Then, Section IV highlights our experimental methodology and Section V discusses the results including interpretation and accuracy of the learnt decision tree models, and the prediction of the winner. Finally, Section VI concludes with a mention of the limitations of our work and future work directions  II  R ELATED W ORK  Twitter has been analyzed in the 2008 US presidential elections. Topsy, which a real time social network analytics provider, in a joint work with Twitter, built the \223Twitter Political Index\224 which presented a daily analysis of user\222s sentiments for various topics related to the elections. Topsy analyzed tweets about both the presidential candidates Obama and Romney\d calculated their popularity score based on the sentiment present in the users\222 tweets    A big data analysis project for a Stanford course adopted a related approach for the 2012 US presidential elections [7  They found that support vector machines are better predictive models than na\357ve Bayes, and used them to correctly predict Obama as the election winner. Notwithstanding the result, the authors also highlight that Twitter cannot be considered completely self-sufficient in predicting elections. Also, in  th e au th ors e m plo y s e n t i m ent an al y s is on t w eets  to  predict the voting percentage, i.e., the percentage of votes which each presidential cand idate will receive in the Singapore Presidential Election 2011. They create sentiment divisions and employ re-weighting techniques on these divisions to predict voting percentage.  The results didn\222t predict the correct winner, and the authors indicate a change in voting trend and fake Twitter sentiment for these discrepancies In t h e au t h ors an al yzed abou t 1 00 000 t w eet s containing the name or mention to a political party or politician. This study was done to understand if there was any linkage or similarity between the online political sentiment and offline sentiment about the German Federal Elections They used Twitter messages to predict the popularity of political parties, candidates and coalitions in the real world This work also uses sentiment analysis techniques to measure the popularity of the candidates in question. Twitter opinion mining has also been applied to the Belgian elections of 2010 The experiment was conducted on 7600 tweets about Belgian politicians, and positive and negative sentiments were calculated using sentiment analysis techniques. Different analytics were extracted from the study and are elaborated in 13  No t w it h s ta n d in g t h es e ap p licatio n s it h a s b e en  significantly highlighted in at th e predictiv e accu racy of  Twitter in predicting the election winner is quite exaggerated The authors prove that Twitter analysis often provides a myopic view of the election results, but it definitely cannot replace the traditional voting method In this paper, we are not aiming for this replacement \226 we are simply gauging the opinions of the users based on what data we have, although we already know that Twitter is not that commonly used across Pakistan as in USA, Germany etc Our results are hence valid across the computer-savvy population which is mainly resident in important cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad etc. Other than politics Twitter data has also been used in domains such as healthcare and disease control. The study a s con d u c ted t h e surveillance of Twitter data for asthma related tweets using NLP and Machine learning techniques for this study. Their models are able to predict with good certainty whether the tweet was made for the symptom of the disease, its medication or its triggers. Also its sentiment could be determined as positive or negative. Statistical machine-learning classifiers including K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines were trained on the unigram and bigram models of the data  III  D ATA P RE PROCESSING  The first step in big data analysis is data pre-processing data cleaning\, which involves crucial steps for preparing the data for analysis, e.g., data extraction, selection, reduction transformation etc. [18 O u r  da t a  pr e pro c e ssi ng st ep s a r e described below A  Data Gathering Data was gathered using a website called Twimemachine 15   w h ic h allo w s  y o u to f e tch th e late st t w eets o f a u s er  However, it only fetches around 3200 latest tweets of a user This cap was enough for us as we only needed data from January 2013 - May 2013 till the Election Day, that is, May 11. For most users' timelines, this was enough.  As mentioned in Section I, we concentrated on tweets related to three political parties which were significantly tweeted, i.e Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf \(PTI\, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz \(PMLN\nd Muttahida Qaumi Movement \(MQM  Visual Analysis After observing, tweets of around 50 relevant users, for around two to three weeks, we decided to fetch tweets of 24 users, 15 of which were political analysts and 9 were normal everyday users. We selected these users based on the content of their tweets, i.e., we deemed their tweets most relevant for electoral prediction. This activity got us approximately 55000 tweets out of which only 9000 were relevant with respect to the attributes we considered important for a tweet to be political. Some of these attributes are highlighted in Figure 1 Many of them were popular hash tags that were trending on Twitter during the election period. Others were frequently used terms or names of political parties and politicians     


51   Fig. 1  Identified attributes which make a tweet politically relevant B  Data Cleaning  We downloaded the tweets as raw text files and cleaned them by performing the following steps 200  Removed the word \223RT\224 \(denotes re-tweet 200  Removed usernames, written as \223@username\224 200  Removed all URLs 200  Removed the following punctuation marks    _      200  Removed all dates and timestamps of tweets from the tweet content but stored it in a separate record against the tweet 200  Replaced double and triple spaces between words with single space 200  Removed stop words, but later when constructing the attribute matrix \(detailed in next section\, this effort seemed unnecessary After executing the aforementioned steps, we got a normalized version of most tweets. For instance, the tweet \223 RT NadeemfParacha: A defiant press conference in Karachi by ANP, MQM and PPP. Tue Apr 30 19:39:16 +0000 2013\224 was transformed to \223 A defiant press conference in Karachi by ANP MQM and PPP\224 after cleaning IV  EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY  As mentioned in Section I, our goal is to predict the winning political party of the Pakistan 2013 elections. For this, we train predictive models for each party and test them to predict the winning party. Our prediction \(classification labels are Pro and Anti; Pro represents a positive sentiment favoring the party and Anti represents a negative one. We constructed three separate attribute matrices for each political party, and use them to construct predictive models using tweets from 1 st January, 2013 till 7 th May, 2013.  Specifically we manually visualized and extracted those tweets for each party which contained those attributes that represent either a Pro or Anti opinion. We rejected tweets with a neutral opinion. For example, the PTI matrix contains attributes like IMRANKHAN" \(sentiment for PTI candidate Imran Khan TEHREEKEINSAAF" \(sentiment for PTI IK4NayaPakistan" \(support Imran Khan for a New Pakistan StampOnBat" \(vote for bat which is the electoral image for PTI\. Having identified the attributes, we then updated the respective column for an attribute with a \2210\222 if the attribute is not found in the tweet and \2211\222 if the attribute exists. Finally we labeled each tweet with either Pro or Anti. Table I shows a snapshot of the PTI matrix with both attributes and labels, and Table II shows a snapshot from the MQM matrix with only the labels   Table I     Attribute Matrix and Labeling for PTI Tweet  PTI Imran Khan Naya Pakistan Stamp OnBat Label Clear majority of PTI in Lahores urban areas StampOnBat  1 0 0 1 PRO PTI Candidate Naeem Shehzad from PS90 arrested in fraud NayaPakistan 1 0 1 0 ANTI ImranKhan not using Bullet Proof Glass BraveImran PTI 1 1 0 0 PRO  Table II     Labeling for MQM Tweet  Label when a terrorist org MQM claims to have mandate in Karachi This is what happens killers are roaming around freely  ANTI going voting ballot boxes havent arrived dad cursing mqm sigh ANTI honest young educated dedicated representatives ivotemqm Pakistan PRO koi darr nahi bum ka vote sirf mqm ka mqmwontsurrender PRO We identified 10 attributes for PTI and PMLN and 13 attributes for MQM. Also, the PTI, PMLN and MQM training matrices contained 318, 362 and 858 tweets respectively For training, we used the Rapid Miner tool http://rapidi.com to experiment with three different standard predictive models, i.e., CHAID decision tree, Na\357ve Bayes and Support Vector Machine \(SVM\ [1  C H A I D C h i s qu ar e d  A u tom atic  Interaction Detector\ is well suited for the analysis of larger datasets. It builds non-binary trees where each non-terminal node identifies a split condition on attributes using the Chisquared test, to yield optimum prediction of the label The naive Bayes is  a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong naive\ndependence assumptions, i.e., the presence or absence of an attribute is unrelated to the presence or absence of any other feature. Finally, SVM is a non-probabilistic, linear, and a binary predictor which maps a prediction problem into a highdimensional space to determine the support vectors, i.e., the subset of training data which is most representative to distinguish between the two classes \(Pro and Anti\. Both na\357ve Bayes and SVM have shown high predictive performance on many datasets \(for more details on these models, refer to [18    We train our 3 models by using the standard 10-fold cross 


52  validation [18 an d c o m p are  t h eir p r e d i ctiv e  ac cu r acy  i  e t h e percentage of correct predictions After training, we constructed test attribute matrices for each political party. The test matrix for a given party contained the same attributes as listed in its training matrix. The tweets from 8 th May 2013 \226 11 th May 2013 were used in the test matrices. These tweets were pre-processed and the matrices populated with 1 and 0 as for training counterparts. The PTI PMLN and MQM test matrices contained 121, 123 and 192 tweets respectively. We left the \223Label\224 column blank, as this is predicted by Rapid Miner by using the party-specific predictive model. The party which gives the largest percentage of correct predictions is the predicted winner. Finally, for the sake of increased validation, we manually inserted the labels in each test matrix to compare with the predictions of Rapid Miner V  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  In this section, we discuss our results. Initially, we compare the predictive accuracies of CHAID, na\357ve Bayes and SVM which are shown in Table III 1  Table III     Accuracies for CHAID, Na\357ve Bayes, and SVM  Algorithm Accuracy CHAID PTI 77 PMLN 66 MQM 60  Na\357ve Bayes  PTI 78 PMLN 64 MQM 59  Support Vector Machine PTI 78 PMLN 65 MQM 53 We can see that there is no significant difference in the accuracies of the algorithms, with respect to the political parties. Still, CHAID gives better accuracy for PMLN and MQM. We thus select CHAID because it also outputs prediction rules which help us to understand the positive \(Pro and negative \(Anti\timents of Twitter users regarding political parties. We enlist them in the following sections A  PTI Predictive Rules The PTI classification rules which are more important for prediction are enlisted below 200  Tweets containing only \223IK\224 are 76% Pro-PTI 200  Tweets containing only \223PTI\224 are 91% Pro-PTI 200  Tweets containing \223PTI\224 and \223Support\224 are 70% ProPTI 200  Tweets containing \223PTI\224 and \223NayaPakistan\224, or 223PTI\224 and \223IMRANKHAN\224  are 100% Pro-PTI 200  Tweets containing \223PTI\224 and \223IK\224 are 75% Pro-PTI 200  Tweets containing \223PTI\224, \223IK\224 and \223Support\224 are 72% Pro-PTI 200  Tweets containing \223PTI\224, \223IK\224 and \223NayaPakistan\224 are 100% Pro-PTI    1 All percentages in this paper are rounded to the nearest integer 200  Tweets containing \223PTI\224, \223IK\224 and \223IMRANKHAN\224 are 100% Pro-PTI 200  Tweets containing \223PTI\224 and \223Reject\224 are 100 Anti-PTI  B  PMLN Predictive Rules The PMLN classification rules which are more important for prediction are enlisted below 200  Tweets containing \223Nawaz Sharif\224 and \223vote\224 are 75% Pro-PMLN 200  Tweets containing \223pmln\224 and \223vote\224 are 64% ProPMLN 200  Tweets containing \223pmln\224 and \223join\224 are 60% ProPMLN 200  Tweets containing only \223Nawaz Sharif\224 are approximately 50% Pro-PMLN and 50% Anti-PMLN 200  Tweets containing \223pmln\224 and \223Nawaz Sharif\224 are 63% Anti-PMLN, while Tweets containing \223pmln\224 223Nawaz Sharif\224 and \223pti\224 are 63% Pro-PMLN 200  Tweets containing \223pmln\224 and \223shame\224 are 86 Anti-PMLN 200  Tweets containing \223pmln\224 are 77% Anti-PMLN Tweets containing \223pmln\224 and \223pti\224 are 68% AntiPMLN 200  Tweets containing \223pmln\224, \223vote\224 and \223pti\224 are 70% Anti-PMLN 200  Tweets containing \223pmln\224, \223support\224 and \223shame\224 are 100% Anti-PMLN  C  MQM Predictive Rules The MQM classification rules which are more important for prediction are enlisted below 200  Tweets containing \223MQM\224 and \223support\224 are 63 Pro-MQM 200  Tweets containing \223MQM\224 and \223Altaf\224 are 65% ProMQM 200  Tweets containing \223MQM\224 and \223WaadaByMQM\224 are 100% Pro-MQM 200  Tweets containing \223MQM\224 and \223TeamMQM\224 are 97% Pro-MQM 200  Tweets containing \223MQM\224 and \223join\224 are 58% ProMQM 200  A tweet not containing \223MQM\224 is 68% Anti-MQM while tweets containing only \223MQM\224 are 57% AntiMQM 200  Tweets containing \223MQM\224 and \223vote\224 are 63% AntiMQM  D  A Comparison of Predictive Rules From the aforementioned rules, we extract the following important information 200  A large majority of PTI and MQM tweets are in favor of the party, and the Pro percentages for these tweets are higher as compared to those for 


53  PMLN. In other words, a high positive sentiment is associated with PTI and MQM, as compared to PMLN 200  There is a higher positive sentiment for PTI as compared to MQM 200  PMLN has been primarily criticized by PTI supporters and vice versa \(this fact is associated with the occasional vociferous speeches by each party\222s candidates against the others 200  The word \223MQM\224 \(by itself\as largely been used to express negative sentiments about MQM 200  The word \223PTI\224 \(by itself\ has largely been used to express positive sentiments about PTI 200  The birth of a new Pakistan \(\223NayaPakistan\224 was a prime motivation for Twitter users to express support for PTI 200  Users have used the name of the PTI prime minister candidate \(ImranKhan\ely express positive sentiment, and the name of PMLN prime minister candidate \(Nawaz Sharif to express positive and negative sentiment equally; MQM candidate Altaf Hussain was not that much significantly mentioned 200  The promises made by MQM and its unifying spirit for the supporters were primary motivations to express support for MQM E  Precision  for Pro and Anti Classes Using CHAID, we determine the precision for each of the two classes, i.e., Pro and Anti. The results are shown in Tables IV, V and VI. The highest precision for Pro is obtained for PTI \(78%\ollowed by MQM \(71%\d PMLN \(69%\nti precisions are lesser than their Pro counterparts, for each party, with the highest for MQM 59%\N \(53%\d then PTI \(42%\learly, Pro is being predicted better than Anti for each party, although the difference is the least for MQM, followed by PMLN and then PTI \(highest difference\his is probably due to the lesser frequency of Anti statements available for PTI and PMLN data. Note that the \223recall\224 measure, i.e., the number of retrieved relevant instances, is not much useful in a cross-validation scenario of data training [18  Table IV    Class Precision for PTI  True Pro True Anti Precision Predicted Pro 238 67 79 Predicted Anti 7 5 42  Table V    Class Precision for PMLN  True Pro True Anti Precision Predicted Pro 203 95 69 Predicted Anti 30 33 53  Table VI    Class Precision for MQM  True Pro True Anti Precision Predicted Pro 120 51 71 Predicted Anti 286 400 59 F  Predicting the Winning Party As outlined in Section IV, we constructed test matrices for PTI, PMLN and MQM and used them to make predictions for 8 th May \226 11 th May, by using the learnt decision trees for each party. The predictions for PTI, PMLN and MQM are shown in Tables VII, VIII and IX respectively. In each table, we first list the number of tweets for each day, followed by the number of Pro predictions \(Pro Pred.\d Anti predictions \(Anti Pred.\ for that day. All predictions are expressed as percentages  Table VII  Electoral Prediction for PTI  Tweets Pro Pred. Anti Pred 8 t h May 16 100 0 9 t h May 31 97 3 10 t h May 32 97 3 11 t h May 39 100 0  Table VIII  Electoral Prediction for PMLN  Tweets Pro Pred. Anti Pred 8 t h May 19 26 74 9 t h May 15 0 100 10 t h May 16 6 94 11 t h May 73 23 77  Table IX  Electoral Prediction for MQM  Tweets Pro Pred. Anti Pred 8 t h May 16 12 88 9 t h May 20 15 85 10 t h May 39 7 93 11 t h May 117 16 84  As can be seen, PTI has the highest percentage of Pro predictions for each day, which considerably outnumber the Pro predictions for both PMLN and MQM. Consequently both PMLN and MQM have very high Anti predictions. These results clearly show that twitter sentiments predict PTI as the winning party, and at the same time, predict PMLN and MQM to lose heavily. In order to further verify our results, we manually labeled the tweets in each test matrix \(as Pro or Anti\nd compared these labels with the predicted ones. The results are shown in Table X. We made manual Anti predictions for MQM and PMLN, and manual Pro prediction for PTI. Also, the predictions are expressed as average over 4 days \(8 th 11 th May\. We can see that the Pro prediction is still the highest for PTI, followed by PMLN and the MQM. This result strongly reinforces our statement that Twitter sentiments predict PTI as the winning party. Nevertheless, we do observe a drastic increase in the Pro prediction for PMLN, which signals a type of \223bias\224 in learning. However, this bias is associated with the users\222 sentiments, and may required extensive experimentation with different parameters and algorithms \(which is outside the scope of this work     


54  Table X  Comparison of Predictions with Manual Labels  Avg Manual Avg. Actual PTI Pro Prediction 76 99 PMLN Anti Prediction 44 87 MQM Anti Prediction 88 63  As the elections are already over, we must comment that the actual winning party was PMLN \(with respect to seats in the top-level National Assembly\, followed by PPP \(which was not at all focused on Twitter\I, and finally MQM refer to http://hamariweb.com/pakistan-election-2013  However, PTI achieved landslide victory in the Khyber Pakhtunkhaa province, and grabbed seats from several important constituencies across the country. Moreover, PTI supporters issued rigging complaints from the NA-250 constituency, in which re-election lead to PTI victory. From this, we derive the following conclusions 200  The educated category of political analysts was primarily supporting PTI, possibly because of the party\222s vision to implement reforms in a better way than the other parties 200  Notwithstanding our limited number of Twitter users and their tweets, our predictions are still valid for one whole province 200  From a generic perspective, Twitter users do not represent the significant voting population of Pakistan 200  Twitter may not always significantly impact election results, as PPP won without any considerable Twitter usage Recall from Section II that many electoral predictions using Twitter were not exactly precis How e v e r, ou r m e s s a g e  in this paper is that Twitter did create a unifying community of PTI supporters which did have some type of positive impact on the result. In other words, the use of social networking can have a large say in determining the election result, which is what we observed for the US Presidential 2012 Elections  VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we have used Twitter to predict the winning political party for the Election held in Pakistan in May 2013 The primary motivation was the positive impact which Twitter analysis had on helping Obama to win US Presidential 2012 elections. We identified a number of relevant users \(mainly political analysts\tracted their tweets, and the attributes most useful to gauge the positive and negative user sentiments. Using Rapid Miner, we learnt decision tree predictive models with the CHAID algorithm, as it had better predictive accuracy compared to two other standard algorithms, i.e., Na\357ve Bayes and Support Vector Machines We extracted useful rules regarding tweeting trends associated with positive and negative opinions. Our predictions reveal PTI to win the elections. In reality, even though PMLN was the actual winner, PTI did obtain a landslide victory in one province, and bagged other important seats across the country Our results demonstrate the importance of Twitter in creating some type of positive impact for winning elections, which is reminiscent of Obama\222s victory in US 2012 elections However, in Pakistan, Twitter alone cannot be relied heavily for electoral prediction due to its developing Pakistani userbase.

 We note that for most strings the parallel suf\223x tree code alone takes as much time or more time than our entire LZ-factorization algorithm and since a suf\223x tree-based LZ-factorization algorithm involves many other procedures e.g tree contraction least common ancestors and Euler tours it is unlikely that such an algorithm will have a better overall performance We have presented a simple parallel algorithm for Lempel-Ziv factorization which requires 
time

 for integer alphabets We showed that a practical implementation of our algorithm is fast for a wide variety of input strings and achieves good speedup on

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
