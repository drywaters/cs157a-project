A Performance Evaluation of Hive for Scientific Data Management Taoying Liu, Jing Liu, Hong Liu, Wei Li Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, China lty, liujing2013, lh, liwei}@ict.ac.cn   Abstract  It is very important to evaluate the MapReducebased frameworks for scientific data processing applications Scientists need a low-cost, scalable, easy-to-use and faulttolerance platform for large volume data processing eagerly. This paper presents an implementation of a scientific data management benchmark, SSDB, on Hive, a MapReduce-based data warehouse. A complete strategy of migrating SSDB to Hive is described in detail including query HQL implementation, data partition schema and adjustments of underlying storage facilities We have tuned the performance using several system parameters provided by Hive, Hadoop and HDFS. This paper provides preliminary results and analysis. Evaluation results indicate that Hive achieves acceptable performance for some data analysis tasks even compared with some high efficient distributed parallel databases, but it needs subtle adjustments of underlying storage facilities and indexing mechanism Keywords  benchmark; scientific data management; Hive performance evaluation I   I NTRODUCTION  Distributed data processing frameworks like Hadoop and its toolsets are widely used in business data processing field, especially in log analysis, data mining, business intelligence, and so on. There are less researches of scientific data processing on such platforms. However scientific data are expanding with an explosion speed. Scientists are among those who need a cheap, scalable distributed data processing platform urgently. Due to the following reasons, scientists prefer Hadoop-like technologies: \(1\ase of use and learning 2\unction extensible, \(3\ si mple yet feasible scalability solution, and \(4\ low costs Currently there are some efforts on scientific data processing on Hadoop platform such as    a n d   B u t t h e r e s t i l l l a c k s a b e n c hm a rk o f s c i e n t i f i c da t a  processing on distributed platforms i s a w o r k  of evaluating the performance of astrophysics data queries implemented in Interactive Data Language [3 o n  a n R D B M S  and Pig, a data query engine based on Hadoop. In this work, 5 queries are extracted from the most often used operations by astrophysicists. Performance is compared, and it is found that Pig gets lower performance than database and IDL do on clusters with 10 or less nodes. Hadoop-like distributed frameworks are designed for clusters with hundreds or thousands of nodes, and their performance advantage over databases will be shown in that situation, and they are not efficient as databases are on small scale clusters. The work is done on Pig without any further optimizations. Technologies like column-store, partitions are adopted in many Hadoop-like frameworks, and they can bring much performance promotion for certain applications. What impact will these technologies bring to scientific data processing is not discussed SSDB  Standard Science DBMS Benchmark, was proposed in XLDB 2010 by MIT CSAIL research group SSDB is proposed as a performance benchmark of a distributed scientific database that is the research output from this group. SSDB is a good typical workload sample of astronomy, remote sense and medicine image applications.

First, to be best of our knowledge, we are the first to comprehensively present how the SSDB can be implemented using the standard Hadoop and Hive software stack. Second, our detailed performance evaluation, with a complete coverage of various parameters tuning, reveals both the advantages and disadvantages of the Hadoop ecosystem when executing different SSDB workloads.

parts: data and queries. Data of SSDB are abstracted from astronomy, remote sensing, medicine image processing. Those data are all location-based in a 2-dimensional space Data of SSDB simulate astronomy data of sky survey Astronomical telescopes of a sky survey plan take pictures of their observation range, then slowly turn a very small angel and continue taking pictures of the new observation area Every picture is a rectangle image in the sky and each point of this image is transformed into a record with 11 physical attributes stored in 4-byte integers. The size of an image depends on the diameter of the telescope. There are 4 major scale configurations of SSDB dataset, see Table I. Each dataset is composed of sky images taken from telescopes. For example, for small scale, the image size is 3750*3750, and there are 160 images in this dataset. Actually, this is a 3dimension array. Coordinates X, Y are the locations of a point in the observation area, and Z means the absolute position of the observation area. If you want to get the absolute position of a point, you should first look up a table to get the absolute position of the start point of this area, and then add X, Y. In fact, Z cannot cover the whole sky. It is picked randomly from the sky, with 80% from dense areas and 20% from sparse sky TABLE I SSDB D ATA S CALES Very_ small Small Normal Large Image width 1600 3750 7500 15000 of images 40 160 400 1000 Total Size 4.5GB 99GB 0.99TB 9.9TB Not all original raw data need to be processed after forth SSDB first do the ‘cook’ process, and this process is called findstars’. Original data are scanned, if the value of one point is greater than the threshold, then the neighbors of this point are checked iteratively, points that have greater values than the threshold are included into this continued observation. The cook process removes most parts of the dark sky, and leaves data useful for future research. The second step of ‘cook performs a simple cluster algorithm. On the basis of the data of the first step, stars that are located within a short distance are grouped together into one polygon. This process is called groupstars’. The resulted areas from ‘groupstars’ could correspond to stars, boundaries of vegetation regions \(satellite imagery\, temperature regions \(oceanography\, or medical anomalies \(medical imaging B SSDB Queries There are 9 queries in SSDB Q1: Scan all the original data and compute the average value of one attribute Q2: Recook one image of the raw data using a different threshold Q3: Alleviate noise and collapse the original array for a 10:3 proportion Q4: Compute the average value of observation attributes of all the stars that fall into a specified rectangle Q5: Get all records of observations whose polygons fall into a specified rectangle Q6: In the specified slab, find all the small rectangle tiles containing more observations than a threshold Q7: For all the observation groups, find those whose centers fall in the specified area at any time Q8: Find those observation groups whose trajectories intersect the specified area, and output raw data of those observation groups for small tiles. Trajectory is defined as the sequence of centers of the observations in a group Q9: Define trajectory as the sequence of the boundary of the observation group. Find those observation groups whose trajectories intersect the specified area, and output raw data of those observation groups for small tiles These 9 queries can be divided into 3 categories. First category is the scan-type query, Q1, Q2, and Q3. They work on the whole original raw data. All data need to be scanned But the queries are simple. The second type of queries, Q4, Q5 Q6 and Q7, query on the output of cooking process in order to find observation objects that intersect with a certain area of the sky. These queries scan only part of the cooked data. The third category includes Q8 and Q9, they are very complex queries They first find object ids from the cooking results, and then get records detail corresponding to object ids from the original data. The input of Q8 and Q9 covers not only the cooked data but also the original raw data III S SDB I MPLEMENTATION ON H IVE SSDB is a built-in benchmark of SciDB. There are also SSDB for MySQL version, which can be downloaded from XLDB website  T h i s v e r s i o n i s t o t a l l y di ff e r e n t f r o m  SciDB version. Data are distributed evenly among cluster nodes and are loaded as local tables into a MySQL instance on each node. Programs written in C++ are used for global control and data processing SSDB has not been ported to MapReduce platforms before We choose Hive as the migration target because that Hive is a widely used MapReduce-based data warehouse, and it supports SQL-like query language and we can add user defined function into Hive. In this section, we will describe how SSDB data is loaded and stored in Hive, and how queries are programmed A Hive Background Hive  i s  a n o p e n s o u r c e H a do o p b a s e d da t a  warehouse framework. With series of tools that Hive provides structured data files can be mapped to database tables. Hive also defines a SQL-like language called Hive Query Language which is compatible to SQL. HQL statements can be translated into MapReduce tasks to run on multiple nodes Data in Hive can be stored in three formats, text, sequence binary and RCFile[8 Te x t is  t h e d e f a u lt d a ta s t o r e f o r m a t  o f  Hive. It is often used in log processing and data loading. The drawback of text format is that the costs for parsing are much 40 


higher than using the binary format and data should be parsed repeatedly for each time of query execution Sequence file is a binary format provided by Hadoop and also supported in Hive. Sequence file uses standard writable interface to implement serialization and deserialization. Data are stored as <key, value> pairs in sequence file RCFile, Record Columnar File, is designed for storing relational tables on clusters using the MapReduce framework It divides table data first horizontally and then vertically Table records are divided into row groups. Each row group block contains the sync marker, metadata header and the table data. Values of one column are stored continuously, and then the next column in this row group. Thus RCFile is able to read only necessary columns and skip those columns that are not needed in queries Hive does not support indexing. Data are stored in fixed chunks in HDFS. However Hive uses part ition mechanism to narrow down query range, which can be seen as a very simple alternative to indexing. With this mechanism, data can be divided into partitions using a hashing based method. If the partition identification is specified in the where clause, only that partition of the data are scanned TABLE II I MPLEMENTATION OF SSDB Q UERIES IN H IVE AND S CI DB Q SciDB Array Query Language Hive Query Language Q1 avg\(subarray\(normal,0,0,0,19,7499,7499\,a select avg\(a\ from normalrc where z<=19 and y<=7499 and x<=7499 Q2 findstars\(subarray\(normal,0,0,0,0, 7499,7499\,a,900 MapReduce program Q3 thin\(window subarray\(normal_reparted,0,0,0,19, 7499,7499 0,1,0,4,0,4,avg\(a\\,0,1,2,3,2,3 select * from select cast\(x/4 as int\ as sj cast\(y/4 as int\ as si, cast\(avg\(a\ as int\  from normal where z<=19 group by cast\(x/4 as int\ast\(y/4 as int\ormal2 where \(si-2\%3=0 and  \(sj-2\%3=0 Q4 for \(i=0..19 avg\(filter\(subarray\(normal_obs_`printf $i`, 491000, 493000 501000, 503000, center is not null\,sumPixel select avg\(sumpixel\ from normal_obs_sumrc where j>=493000 and j<=503000 and i>=491000 and i<=501000 and center='true Q5 for \(i=0..19 filter\(subarray\(normal_obs_`printf $i`, 491000, 493000 501000, 503000, polygon is not null select * from normal_obs_sumrc where j>=493000 and j<=503000 and i>=491000 and i<=501000 and center='true Q6 for \(i=0..19 filter\(window\(filter\(subarray\(normal_obs_`printf $i`, 491000 493000, 501000, 5030000, center is not null 0,12,0,12,count\(center\center_count>$count select x1,y1,cs from select cast\(j/12 as int\as x1,cast\(i/12 as int\s y1, count\(*\ as cs from normal_obs_sumrc where j>=493000 and j<=503000 and i>=491000 and i<=501000 group by cast\(j/12 as int\,cast\(i/12 as int\\heihei where heihei.cs>1 Q7 filter\(aggregate\(normal_groups,avg\(x\,avg\(y\,group\, x_avg 496000 and y_avg > 497000 and x_avg < 500000 and y_avg<510000 select * from normal_obs_sumrc where j>=493000 and j<=503000 and i>=491000 and i<=501000 and polygon is not null Q8 aggregate\(cross_join\(small_groups, filter\(sum \(project \(apply cross \(subarray \( Points, 0,3 \, join \(subarray \(small_groups null null, null,18\ as Pi, subarray \(small_groups null,1,null,null as Pj\rosses iif \(\(\(\(\(Pi.y Points.y\and Pj.y > Points.y\\ OR \(\(Pi.y Points.y\ and Pj.y <= Points.y\nd Points.x < Pi.x Points.y Pi.y\ / \(Pj.y Pi.y\* \(Pj.x Pi.x\and Pi.x is not null and Pi.y is not null and Pj.x is not null and Pj.y is not null\ 1, 0 crosses crosses,Pj.group\, crosses_sum > 0 avg\(small_groups.x\,avg\(small_groups.y\,small_groups.group  select /*+ mapjoin\(q81\*/ cast\(i/100 as int\,cast\(j/100 as int from normal_obsrc join select oid from normal_groupsrc where pinp\(cast\(x as int\, cast\(y as int\,497000,498000,499000,500000\=1\q81 on \(normal_obsrc.oid=q81.oid\ group by cast\(i/100 as int\,cast\(j/100 as int select /*+ mapjoin\(q8_1\*/ cast\(normalrc1.y1*1000+normalrc1.x1 as int\,normalrc1.x,normalrc1.y,normalrc1.a,normalrc1.b,normalrc1.c,normalrc1.d,no rmalrc1.e,normalrc1.f,normalrc1.g,normalrc1.h,normalrc1.i,normalrc1.j,normalrc1 k from normalrc1 join q8_1 on \(normalrc1.x1=q8_1.x and normalrc1.y1=q8_1.y Q9 aggregate\(filter\(filter\(cross subarray\(small_obs_0 491000, 493000, 501000, 5030000 s A, small_groups\,A.polygon is not null A.oid=small_groups.oid\,avg\(small_groups.x\,avg\(small_grou ps.y\small_groups.group select oid, cast\(\(avg\(ax\-496211\/100 as int\, cast\(\(avg\(ay\-497861\/100 as int from \(select normal_groupsrc.x as ax, normal_groupsrc.y as ay normal_groupsrc.oid from normal_groupsrc join select normal_obs1rc.oid as oid from normal_obs1rc where j>=498000 and j<=500000 and i>=497000 and i<=499000 and polygon is not null\C on\(C.oid=normal_groupsrc.oid\\haha group by oid create table if not exists normalq9result like normalrc insert overwrite table q9result select /*+ mapjoin\(q9_1\*/ cast\(normalrc1.y1*1000+normalrc1.x1 as int\,normalrc1.x,normalrc1.y,normalrc1.a,normalrc1.b,normalrc1.c,normalrc1.d,no rmalrc1.e,normalrc1.f,normalrc1.g,normalrc1.h,normalrc1.i,normalrc1.j,normalrc1 k from normalrc1 join q9_1 on \(normalrc1.x1=q9_1.x_avg and normalrc1 y1=q9_1.y_avg 41 


B SSDB Queries in HQL HQL is quite similar to the standard SQL, but HQL in Hive only has preliminary functions compared with MySQL SSDB MySQL version use s  spatial query and indexing function in MySQL. Queries of Q4-Q9 all use this advanced feature. All the queries use C++ codes in distributing data and paralleling process. Although SQL and HQL are very similar neither SQL statements nor C++ codes can be directly migrated from MySQL version to implement SSDB queries in Hive. In order to provide complete functionality of SSDB, we implement 9 queries in HQL from scratch. Queries for normal scale test in HQL and AQL are listed in TABLE II except Q8 and Q9, because the AQL scripts for normal dataset are too long to fit in the table space, we list HQL statement for small scale. SciDB AQL statements are listed here to help understanding and validating the queries Q2 is implemented as a MapReduce program and inserted into Hive as a user defined function Except for window and thin operators, HQL statements of Q1-Q7 are easy to understand. Because Hive provides distributed framework and parallel processing capability, there is no need to write any C++ codes or Java codes We find that some operators in AQL have no correspondence to any HQL operators, such as window subarray, project, and thin. Window p e r a t o r i n A Q L i s a  fairly common operation in scientific data processing, it computes aggregates over moving window. Thin o p e r a t o r  is to select data from an array at fixed intervals along each dimension. Hive does not support multi-dimensional window operator. In Q3, the average value of property ‘a’ should be calculated on a running 5*5*2 3D window. Window operation needs to locate the neighbors of a record along all dimensions and store these records in memory for aggregation. Because there is no indexing in Hive, it is very resource-consuming to locate neighborhoods of a point in 3D space. So we simplify query Q3 to calculate on a running 2D window with window size of 5*5. The aggregation inside a window is implemented by HQL operator ‘group by’, elements in this window are grouped together and calculated C Data Partitions in Hive There are two categories of data in SSDB. One is the original raw data. This data is the mapping of the sky, each record is corresponding to a point in the sky with 14 non-null properties. This category of data is uniform. The data are composed of serial pictures taken by the telescope. Each picture is an image of square shape, and many of such squares scatter over the sky. The coordinates inside the square image are local coordinates. Each square has its starting point; the coordinates of this point are stored in a standalone table. The absolute coordinates of points inside an image can be calculated by adding the starting point coordinates to the local coordinates. Many query statements are related with the local and absolute coordinates Although there is no array support in Hive, Hive has simple indexing mechanism partition to speed up locating array elements. It is natural to store an image in one partition indicated by its image number. We divide the original raw data into several partitions, and the sizes of each partition are totally equal. In the 9 queries, there are Q1 and Q3 in which Z coordinates are specified. For normal scale, Q1 checks the images with image numbers less than 20, which are only 20/400 of the total raw data. With this solution, we can greatly reduce the amount of the input data of Q1 For data cooked and filtered, many of the records of dark areas are removed. Validated observations are unevenly distributed across the sky. In normal scale of SSDB, the size of the result of cook process ‘findstars’ is about 409GB. We have two methods to divide the data into partitions. First method is to put data into zones according to their different image numbers. But in fact, queries on the observations data are all related with the world-coordinate instead of local coordinate with area identifications. In fact, some queries scan data across area boundaries. Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7 use absolute coordinates. So, it will not bring any benefit to narrow the queried range using this partition solution. We adopt the second method. We convert the coordinates of the aftercooked data into absolute coordinates, and divide the data according to their absolute coordinates. The data are gridded into tiles or sliced into stripes, as shown in Fig. 1. There is no essential distinction between the two methods, but they will affect the data distribution in partitions. Some partitions may have much more data than others, and some may have much less data than others. It is the inherent characteristics of the application data who determines the data skew incurred. More details of partitions will be given in section IV Fig. 1 Two Partition Schemas for Cooked Data IV E XPERIMENT R ESULTS AND P ERFORMANCE F ACTORS In this section, we will report the results of SSDB running on Hive and SciDB, and analyze some tuning factors of Hive which could affect the performance A Experimental Setup We run the benchmark on a gigabit ethernet Linux cluster of 5 nodes. Each node has dual 6-core 2.0GHz Intel Xeon E52620 CPUs with the hyperthreading option enabled, and 3 3TB SATA HDDs and 32GB RAM. The version of SciDB we use is 13.2, and the Hive version is 0.9.0, Hadoop is 0.20.0 B System Performance The experiment results are listed in TABLE III. We test the performance of “Load”, “Cook” and 9 queries for both small and normal datasets. Each dataset is distributed among 5 nodes. Every query was run 10 times, and system cache was cleared each time before testing. The numbers in Table III are average values of one running. This is different from   i n  which the execution time is the sum of 15 times of running  42

Both systems load distributed data from several nodes in parallel The bottleneck of reading data is the hard disk bandwidth SciDB and Hive get approximately the same performance in this operation 2 For query Q1 This is a simple query that aggregates one property of all records of the array, but with great performance difference on the two systems. Hive does not support array, it needs to scan all the data to get only one element of an array. While the basic data model of SciDB is array, it can quickly locate any array element according to its coordinates 3 For complicated array operation Q3 There is not much difference on Hive and SciDB 4 For Q7, the query with little data input and output The size of the input file is less than 100MB, in this situation Hive is much slower than SciDB 5 For Q4, Q5 and Q6 In the original SSDB released with SciDB, there are 20 queries accessing the same array in parallel. We change the concurrent queries into sequential ones because SciDB does not respond when processing concurrent user requirements in parallel in our test. This greatly reduces the performance gap between Hive and SciDB compared with the astonishing gap between SciDB and MySQL reported in [14 6 For Q8 and Q9 These two queries first do some data analysis based on the already cooked data and then fetch from raw data records, they deal with large volumes of data both input and output. In original SSDB, the output of Q8 and Q9 are not written back to the hard disk. But usually the output of Q8 and Q9 are quite large, we suppose scientists will like to save them for later research. So we add save statement into Q8 and Q9, this also greatly reduces the performance gap between Hive and SciDB. But there is another reason for the slowness Q8 and Q9 need to read all fields of records and RCFile is not efficient when all fields of records are needed in a query. This is because when reading all columns, it needs to locate all row groups inside an HDFS block. The start of each row group must be found by scanning  C Performance Factors Parallel Processing Slot Number The nodes of our testing platform all have dual 6-core processors with the hyperthreading option enabled. There are 24 cores that can be used. But as for different workload, it is not always beneficial to get more processors. SSDB is a workload with heavy IO consumption, especially for Q1, Q2 for all images\and Q3 We test normal scale of Q1 on SciDB and Hive with different slot size. Q1 is a simple workload which just scans several images and computes the average value of one attribute. We start 4, 8, 16 and 24 instances of SciDB working daemon on each node, and find that Q1 gets best performance when there are 4 instances on one node. It is the hard disk bandwidth which limits the CPU processing speed. We also test Q1 with different mapper slot sizes on Hive, and get the same result, see Fig 2. So we could set the same size of parallel processing unit in these two systems. That is also a relatively fair configuration for our tests Fig. 2 Execution time of Q1 with different slot numbers HDFS Block Size The number of mappers is usually defined by the number of HDFS block size. In most situations, one mapper processes one block. So, multiple processors or nodes could be used simultaneously to process large volumes of data Data of SSDB could be stored using three file storage format, text, sequence, and RCFile. As shown in [1 different storage format greatly influence the application performance, usually binary format may get the best. In our experiments, we have tested queries under these three file formats, RCFile gets better performance than text and sequence file does for queries from Q1 to Q6, but gets worse for Q7, Q8 and Q9. RCFile is suitable for queries that only fetch few columns of the table. As Q8 and Q9 select all attributes of records that meet the conditions, RCFile cannot show benefit for this situation. But for the consistency of the configuration for our tests, we only show RCFile performance of all queries here We use RCFile as our data storage format. For queries Q1 only attributes ‘X’, ‘Y’, ‘Z’ and ‘a’ a re extracted from all 13 attributes. Suppose we use the default HDFS block size 64MB          43 


the data that need to be read are only 14MB, that is to say, one mapper loads only 14MB for its processing. So for small scale 120GB\ query Q1, there should be 1920 mappers. If we set HDFS block size to 256MB, only 480 mappers need to be started. Obviously, the latter configuration greatly decreases the task scheduling costs and the management costs. In the actual testing, 256MB block can achieve much better performance than the default 64MB Partitions and Data Skew As discussed in section III, original raw data are naturally divided into partitions according to their image numbers Partitions are all of the same size. This greatly improves the performance of queries like Q1 and Q3 Cooked data can be partitioned using grid or slice method We grid the cooked data of the small scale into square tiles with 1000*1000 size There are totally 167 tiles containing observation records. Because the stars in the sky are not uniformly distributed, so every tile contains different numbers of stars. From our statistics, using 1000*1000 tiles make the data heavily fragmented. About 65% tiles have sizes below 32MB, see in Fig 3 We have also tried tiles with size 10000*10000. This made partitions evenly distributed, but in our experiment we find that this configuration reads much more data from disk than the 1000*1000 configuration does Big partitions limit the parallel degree, fewer mapper program are used for data processing. Many CPU cores are not involved; this results in a worse performance Fig. 3 Tile Sizes Distribution in Small Scale Under SSDB normal sc ale, although 1000*1000 configuration can incur less data read from hard disks, it will produce too many more files in HDFS and will incur much more extra maintaining overhead, so we divide each image into several stripes along one coordinate. For a 7500*7500 image, there are 8 stripes in it, and every stripe has a size of 7500*1000. This method totally produces 3200 partitions Row Group Size RCFile first divide the table horizontally into row groups The parameter of row group is a block containing table rows and inside these rows, data are stored in columnar style. Row group size can be configured according to different applications features. When row group becomes larger, whole storage space is decreased for smaller meta data space, and the same is the cost of data compression, but needs a larger consumption of RAM. While row group size becomes smaller total storage space consumption is decreased, the time of data compression and decompression increases quickly, incurring extra CPU costs. At the same time, the time of data read from disk is increasing too, because RCFile blocks are small whenever a row group is read, next row group meta data should be located and parsed. We should get balance of the query performance and the storage space, and find a fitful row group size In  t h e  i m pa c t s o f di f f e r e n t  r o w gr o up s i z e  t o que r y  performance are investigated. For word grep application, row group size is configured as 1MB, 4MB and 16MB and the execution time and data read from hard disks are measured Under the workload, the best execution time is achieved when row group is set to 16MB. This value is different from 4MB that is the RCFile designers’ suggestion  T h e de s i g n e r s g e t  this value from the testing of RCFile under the Facebook workload. So the best row group size is relevant to the application logic We test the execution time and data volume read from disks of Q1, see TABLE IV. The data read from disks are measured using Linux system command iostat. As our expectation, the smaller row group size, the longer of execution time and larger data volume read from disks. When the row group size is set to 64MB, we get the best performance and the least data volume read from hard disks TABLE IV E XECUTION T IME AND D ATA R EAD FROM D ISK OF Q1 FOR V ARIED R OW G ROUP S IZE Row Group MB 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 Time sec 105 82 71 67 74 68 63 66 79 Data Read GB 13.4 11.2 9.8 9.1 9.0 8.6 8.4 8.5 8.9 V R ELATED W ORK Since MapReduce s b e e n i n t r o duc e d fo r m a s s i v e  data processing, many data management systems based on it come into birth.

DryadLINQ i s  a parallel work from MicroSoft, it can also translate LINQ or C# into distributed Dryad tasks. Some argue that MapReduce framework is neither designed for scientific applications, nor for scientific data manipulation  D u e to  its  lac k o f s uppo r t  for complex embedded data type and index, many operations of array are very difficult to complete incurring great much extra IO overhead. In this paper, we aim to evaluate to what extent the state-of-the-art MapReduce-based data processing systems can support scientific data management applications As for scientific data processing benchmark, there is little published work in this field.

ours. The authors collect real scientific data from astrophysics and extract 5 queries that are most often used. The goal of this is also to evaluate whether it is suitable for executing scientific data queries on MapReduce-based frameworks. Queries are implemented and executed on Pig  a n d a D B M S  a n d ID L   It shows that in the small scale clusters DBMS significantly outperforms Pig, but not always in the same speedup i s t h e  first work on comparing the performance between MapReduce-based data processing platform and RDBMS. The data used in this benchmark are synthesized plain text and HTML documents. Benchmark operations are ‘grep’ task and complex data analysis tasks like selection, aggregation, join and user defined aggregation. Loading data and analytical tasks are executed on Hadoop, a column-store DBMS Vertica and another commercial DBMS. Testing platforms have 25node, 50-node and 100-node configurations. Actually on all platforms Vertica has the best score, next is the commercial DBMS, and then Hadoop. But for grep task, the larger the scale, the less the performance difference. For analytical tasks even on the 100-node cluster, Hadoop does not show competent performance.

Hadoop-GIS s  a  hi g h pe r f o r m a n c e s p a t i a l da t a  query engine supporting large volumes of spatial data built on Hadoop and Hive. Hadoop-GIS supports global partition indexing and customizing local indexing on demand. These features may accelerate some loc ation related operations in SSDB, e.g., Q4-Q9. Twister[3  i s a l s o  a n i m p r o v e d H a doop based platform supporting iterative scientific computing job These works are all based on Hadoop. SciDB[2 i s  a n e w  distributed parallel database. It is a shared-nothing architecture much like MapReduce framework. Data are stored distributed on the local space of every SciDB instances. These instances could be configured on each node of the cluster, or could be dispatched on each core of one server. SciDB is designed for scientific array data usage models. It supports multiple dimensional arrays, and provides many specific array operators. In our test, it shows good performance score for a 5node cluster VI C ONCLUSIONS SSDB is a standard science DBMS benchmark. It is first implemented on a distributed science database SciDB and on MySQL. We port this benchmark to the mapreduce-based data warehouse Hive and test small and normal scale of SSDB on SciDB and Hive. This paper is a preliminary work, we will do further analysis and tests with new optimization techniques like Hadoop-GIS. Currently we find that Hive/Hadoop could achieve acceptable performance for some data analysis tasks with subtle system parameters tuning. There is great potential for further improvement with good support of scientific data management. First, a specific array-oriented storage format helps a lot. Such storage format should provide quick array elements locating and fetching, boundary checking, and support flexible partition mechanism to deal with data distribution and data skew. Second, some special scientific data array functions could be added into Hive as user defined functions, such as window, thin, subarray, etc. These user defined operators could take full advantage of the underlying storage for scientific data. Third, indexing is needed especially for sparse array and spatial space data. And last, for some complex data queries, there are many intermediate data that are written into hard disk, incurring redundant IO overheads This could be simplified and customized for scientific data management A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported in part by the Hi-Tech Research and Development \(863\ Program of China \(Grant No 2013AA01A212 2013AA01A209\, the National Basic Research \(973\ Program of China \(Grant No.2011CB302502 2011CB302803\, and the major national science and technology special projects \(Grant No. 2010ZX03004-003-03 We like to thank Dr. Rubao Lee and Dr. Yin Huai, for their insightful suggestions.

the one dimensional le We also describe a means of ef“ciently handling cells that may occur at the edge of the split We implement a caching mechanism that prefetches data by taking advantage of prior knowledge of the users access pattern and leads to signi“cant gains in performance An obvious avenue for future work is to explore the effect of ordering partitions using a space lling curve rather than the linear order we currently use Though this organization will be slower for some types of iteration we expect that it will yield acceptable performance in all cases perhaps making it a good default choice for organizing the partitions Our current implementation assumes that the data resides locally but we expect to extend the system to handle remote datasets that span several geographically distributed machines Having prior information about the performance of remote servers may allow the partitioning mechanism to improve load balancing Correspondingly we would like to extend our replica location and selection mechanisms 29 28 to handle very large distributed unstructured spatial datasets The work described here will be instrumental in these future efforts VIII A

 Fig. 10. Complementarity Analysis forSMTCL and Dalian Guangyang  V. CONCLUSIONS  This paper provides a method based on text mining of patents to help extract technology intelligence to facilitate M&A. We take the NCS industry as an example. NCS is the most important part of numerical machine tools. The paper follows a technology forecasting approach and outlines a technology synergy analysis based on a multi-term Boolean search to distinguish NCS records This study has a few limitations. Some doubt remains regarding the reliability of patent data. Sometimes patent data cannot reflect the core techno logy of a company because some patent-based indicators could be obscured by strategic behavior; that is, sometimes an emerging technology is not yet permitted for patenting. Another limitation is that the latest patent data we studied are2 years old because of the 18-month patent application period. In the meantime, some changes in NCS-related technology may well have occurred Within these limitations, the paper sought to forecast developmental trends for key candidate technologies, and based on the technology trends revealed, look for technology acquisition candidates for a certain company  The technology forecasting results suggest that NCS has become a global research hotspot in the field of machine tools in recent years, and patents have reached increased significance in corporate activity. The analysis of country-topic correlation leads us to conclude that there are two research clusters in the wo rld, one centered in Japan and the USA, the other centered on Germany. While China is geographically far away from th e other countries, it has only a faint relationship with Japan and Taiwan; in this relationship the key words are “control,”“signal” and compatibility,” which are differe nt from other countries and do not represent NCS core technology. In addition publication keywords correlation analysis also indicates that control system is a current research hotspot and focus  We then examine the top patent applicants and top publication institutions. As shown, the top patent applicants are mainly Japanese and German corporations, while top publication institutions mainly come from China and the USA. This divergence is logical since the nature of patents and publications is different in that patents focus on applications whereas literature researches theories and methods At the same time, we find that Japanese corporations are powerful in the NCS machine tool industry. Hence we choose the companies FANUC and MITS UBISHI as study targets Comparing SMTCL with them, based on IPC analysis, we observe that G05B19 is the main weakness—incidentally this is a part of the NCS core technology Looking at SMTCL’s M&A history shows us that M&A did increase their patent portfolio and business income. We also learn that SMTCL is be hind the leading NCS-related companies in patenting, although it’s number 1among machine tool enterprises in the world. To make up for its weaknesses, we search for some technology acquisition candidates for SMTCL. We first download all patents related to the technology where SMTCL is lacking. Then we develop a patent filter to select a list of companies as potential targets We analyze the targets’ respective patent portfolios, filtering out all but 3 companies. Finally, we measure the technology synergy among the 3 companies, and analyze the similarity and complementarity between the targets and SMTCL In conclusion, we have grasped the development trends of some candidate technologies by patent data and find the disadvantages of SMTCL. To compensate for the disadvantages, we look for technology candidates for SMTCL M&A. In this paper, we have measured the knowledge relatedness to judge the matching degree between SMTCL and the candidates using patent data, whereas we haven’t done due diligence to make sure the core researchers still work for the target company.

As the thickest shielding studied in this work is 10 cm, it follows then that the lower energies of the incident trapped proton spectra are most affected Additionally, although the incident trapped proton spectra reach energies of up to approximately 600 MeV, the majority of the spectra are dominated by low energy protons and are thus strongly attenuated by the shielding Essentially, the increased shielding thickness has the effect of hardening the incident proton flux distribution. This result also helps explain the significant localized shielding dependencies observed in the TR model development Comparatively, the GCR spectrum includes heavy ions that reach well above GeV energies. Consequently, GCR ions can undergo spallation and fragmentation with the aluminum shielding resulting in the ejection of large amounts of nucleons and lighter ions. All these secondary particles will have energies lower than the primary incident ions but that are still quite large. In addition to this is the sheer abundance of heavy ions present in the primary and secondary flux distributions. With increasing wall thicknesses, the likelihood of spallation, fragmentation, and other resonance effects increases as well. These processes favor the increase in proton and alpha particle fluxes at low energies with thicker shielding. Above the transition points the various flux distributions decrease with increasing wall thickness suggesting they are populated by a combination of high-energy incident protons and alpha particles that penetrate through the shielding as well as heavy ions that release secondary protons and alpha particles. These fluxes will fall off, however, with the shielding thickness as the likelihood of penetration decreases Overall, when the GCR- and TR-induced distributions are summed together, the neutron component and proton component dominate the flux distribution at low energies At higher energies, the protons represent the dominant contributor to the total dose. Furthermore, at very high energies, alpha particles start to become more dominant than neutrons and their abundance becomes comparable to that of the protons. Table 6 and Table 7 detail the calculated ambient dose equivalent rates, effective dose equivalent rates and E/H  10\ios for trapped protons and GCR ions at solar maximum and minimum conditions, and for the four wall thicknesses As is detailed in Table 6, the simulated TR-induced daily ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates decrease with increasing wall thickness. The simulated values are also smaller at solar maximum conditions relative to solar minimum as expected. Next, it is useful to benchmark the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates against the TEPC dose equivalent measurements collected in 2000 and 2009 to verify the assumption that H TEPC  is approximately H  10\d moreover, to verify that the first order approximation provided by Eq. \(9\ is reasonable. The year 2000 coincides with solar maximum conditions and during this time, the ISS orbited at an altitude of 372 km to 396 km. In contrast, the year 2009 represents solar minimum conditions and the ISS orbited at an altitude of 340 km to 380 km. The measured TEPC daily dose equivalent rates at the location of Service Module Panel 327 SM-327\ged between 0.15 \226 0.2 mSv d 1 in 2000 and 0.2 \226 0.3 mSv d 1 in 2009. Comparatively, for solar maximum conditions, the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates were found to be as low as 0.094 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2  to as high as 0.42 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 hese simulated values are within a factor of two of the measured values Similarly, at solar minimum conditions, the simulated results ranged from 0.14 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 wall thickness\ 0.85 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 wall thickness\hich 


14   are again within the range of measured results, though the thinnest shielding results in a slightly more conservative estimate that is within a factor of 3. It is thus noted that a change in wall thickness does have a significant influence on the TR-induced doses. While it is unclear which of the results best approximates the ISS shielding, it is argued that the upper and lower limits of the shielding thicknesses used provide representative limits of the expected dose The simulated TR-induced effective dose equivalent rate determined by Sato et al 53 a t so l a r  mi ni mu m c o nd i t i o n s   for a wall thickness of 5.56 cm \(15 g cm 2 uminum, was estimated to be 0.144 mSv d 1 In that study, fluence-toeffective dose equivalent conversion factors for all heavy ions were used. To compare, at 10.8 g cm 2 in our study the simulated effective dose equivalent was determined to be 0.187 mSv d 1 For a wall thickness of 16.2 g cm 2 the effective dose equivalent rate was determined to be 0.127 mSv d 1 These simulated values are in good agreement with the values presented by Sato et al  d i n di cat e s t h at  the majority of the effective dose equivalent due to TR exposure is reasonably estimated considering only the neutron, proton, and alpha particle contributions. The simulated ratios of E  H  10\uctuate from 0.41 up to 0.51 for solar maximum conditions and 0.35 to 0.48 for solar minimum conditions. This ratio also appears to fall off with decreasing wall thickness. Overall, the latter results suggest that for TR exposures, the TEPC measured ambient dose equivalent offers a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent Unlike the daily TR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates, the predicted GCR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates increase with increasing wall thickness Table 7\This results due to the increased neutron, proton and alpha particle flux distributions at low energies. As expected, the daily ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose equivalent rates are again smaller at solar maximum conditions as compared to solar minimum conditions. The measured GCR dose equivalent values in 2000 and 2009 are on the order of 300 to 400 \265Sv d 1 and 400 to 500 \265Sv d 1 respectively. In comparison, the simulated values range from 60 \265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 8 265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar maximum conditions and 100 265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 o 206 \265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar minimum conditions. These predicted values underestimate the measured ones by more than a factor of two. This can be attributed to the exclusion of the heavy-ion contributions Moreover, these results also suggest that as an operational quantity, the ambient dose equivalent is not well suited for high-energy heavy ions. This observation has also been previously suggested by Pelliccioni h o i n di cat ed t h a t  a depth greater than 10 mm would be more appropriate for higher-energy radiation and that no single depth is appropriate for all heavy ions Sato et al  o calcu late d th e eff ect iv e dos e equiv ale nt rate from GCR exposures \(including heavy ions\for a wall thickness of 15.0 g cm 2 Al to be 0.21 mSv d 1 At solar minimum conditions, the simulated effective dose equivalent rates in this study are found to be 0.13 mSv d 1  and 0.15 mSv d 1 for wall thicknesses of 10.8 g cm 2 and 16.2 g cm 2 respectively. As was the case earlier, there is again a slight discrepancy regards to those published by Sato et al 53 attrib u t ed to th e ex clu s io n o f th e h e a v y io n s   It was shown by Sato [53 th at th e co n t rib u tio n to t h e cumulative effective dose equivalent from both iron nuclei and pions are each nearly as much as the contribution alpha particles. Despite these underestimations, from the current simulations the ratios of effective-to-ambient dose equivalent are relatively constant between solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Furthermore, unlike TR exposures, the ratios decrease from 1.19 to 0.84 with increasing shielding thickness. These results suggest that the ambient dose equivalent is roughly a 1:1 estimate of the effective dose equivalent for GCR exposures, depending on which wall thickness is assumed. However, it is again noted that the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates are underestimated so these ratios should fall below one These latter conclusions can also be verified in another manner. The total effective dose equivalent estimated by Sato et al 53 in sid e th e ISS at so lar m i n i m u m co n d itio n s   was determined to be 0.37 mSv d 1 The total dose equivalent from TR and GCR exposures measured with the TEPC at SM-327 during solar minimum conditions \(2009 is approximately 0.6 \226 0.8 mSv d 1 The ratio of the effective dose equivalent predicted by Sato to these measured TEPC values results in an effective-to-TEPC dose equivalent conversion factor of E  H TEPC of 0.5 to 0.6. This again shows that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent and can be used as an appropriate surrogate protection quantity. This conclusion is applicable to solar maximum conditions as it was shown in the simulation results that for TR exposures the E  H  10\ios are only slightly higher at solar maximum conditions and essentially remain unchanged for GCR exposures from solar maximum to solar minimum 4.6 \226 Complex Geometry Results The above transport simulations at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2 were repeated using the complex geometry shown in Figure 16. Rather than determining the flux inside the entire SM, the flux distribution within the crew quarter \(SM-CQ was examined only. This area best approximates the location of SM-327. When compared to the simple cylinder simulations, the complex geometry is shown to have no effect on the simulated E  H  10\version ratios but does influence the observed ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates. The simulated values for trapped exposures are largely unchanged while for GCR exposures, the complex geometry results in a factor of two increase due to the build-up effect. Specifically, at a wall thickness of 5.4 g cm 2 the simulated ambient and effective 


15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
