Transitive Association Rule Discovery by Considering Strategic Importance Doug Won Choi Dep’t of System Management Engr Sungkyunkwan University Suwon, Korea dougwchoi@paran.com Young Jun Hyun  Quality Management Department National Fusion Research Institute Daejeon, Korea semantic@nfri.re.kr  Abstract The TSAA\(transitive support association Apriori algorithm of this paper discovers transitively associated relationships as well as the frequent itemsets. It utilizes the join item set to find the transitive association rules. Since the join item of a transitive association which have low support value tends to be removed from the next candidate itemset generation, we used two kinds of support values, ‘minimum support’ and ‘minimum relative support,’ in finding the transitive relations. This way the items carrying a strategic importance are given a second chance so that they might be used in discovering the transitive association rules. Our experiments with a real world database showed that the TSAA algorithm was useful in producing transitive itemsets which could not have been obtained otherwise. Observation from other transaction database indicated that there is a ‘minimum relative support level’ at which the number of transitive association itemset decreases suddenly  Keyword transitive association, Apriori, RSAA, market basket analysis  I   I NTRODUCTION  Association rule mining is widely used to find interesting relationships among the items of a market basket. Apriori algorithm is generally used to find Boolean associations [1   S A A rel a t i v e  s u pport as s o ci at i o n  A p ri ori  i s a  modification to find the association rules among the infrequent data items [5 o th A p rio r i an d RS AA algorithms make a brute force search of the association rules to test if they meet the condition for ‘minimum support’ or minimum relative support Oftentimes the important semantic relationships among the market basket items are ignored since the associations with low support have to be dropped out from further considerations by most algo rithms. For example, Apriori discovers frequent itemsets solely by counting the frequency of occurrence of the items in the database. There is no semantics associated with it. RS AA tries to find association rules with relatively low support [5 Bot h al g o ri t h m s  assume that each item has equal importance in its value However, in the real world, certain items are more valuable than others even though they show up less frequently in the market basket. For example, the sale of a TV set returns much greater profit than a toaster oven. In this regard, a new data mining technique would be useful to find the association rules that reflect the semantic aspects or strategic importance. This paper presents a new algorithm that takes into account the semantic aspects of the association. Specifically, this paper considers the transitive association rule as a special case of semantic relation  This paper is comprised of four sections. The next section reviews the basic concepts of association rule mining and discusses recent improvements and variations of the Apriori method. Section three discusses the main idea of transitive association rule mining technique. TSAA algorithm is presented and its sample usage together with a large scale field data application is provided. The last section discusses some findings, issues for further research, and recent progresses about reflecting strategic aspects into the association rule mining technique II  A SSOCIATION RULE MINING AND ITS VARIATIONS  A  Association  rule Basic definition about association rule is briefly summarized here for refreshments of the readers’ memory. Let 0012 i 1 i 2  i m be a set of items and D a database of transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T  0012 An association rule is an implication of the form A 015 B, where A 0136 0012 B 0136 0012   and A 001 B 0013 The rule A 015 B holds in the transaction set D with support s where s is the percentage of transaction in D that contains both A and B. The rule A 015 B has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transaction in D which contains A and it also contains B s Support\(A 015 B\ P\(A 0138 B c Confidence\(A 015 B\ P\(B|A  B  Algorithms for association rule mining Association rules can be classified into many types such as Boolean, quantitative, single vs. multi-dimensional, and single-level vs. multi-level association rules, etc. [2,3,7  Market basket analysis’ belongs in the Boolean association rule category and Apriori is a typical algorithm of market basket analysis. Many variations to the Apriori algorithm have been attempted to improve the algorithm performance They include AprioriTid, MSApriori \(Multiple Support Apriori\Occur \(Maximum Occurrence\nd RSAA 978-0-7695-4108-2/10 $26.00 © 2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/CIT.2010.292 1654 2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT 2010 978-0-7695-4108-2/10 $26.00 © 2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/CIT.2010.292 1654

Relative Support Apriori algorithm o w e v e r, t h e y  differ only in minor features such as different ordering of the data elements, or placing more importance on scarce data items, etc Recent studies on association rule mining address various topics such as multiple support values, recurrent cyclic association rule, spatial association rule, time limited sequential association rule, and intermittent and simultaneous sequential pattern [10,12 Su rv e y s o n t h ese  researches indicate that no transitive association rule has been addressed nor explored so far  1\priori Since the Apriori algorithm [7 e v e r y  f o u n d a tio n a l work of association rule mining, we assume the readers are friendly with the algorithm 2\prioriTid AprioriTid uses Apriori-gen function to generate the candidate itemsets. It differs from Apriori in that it does not need to rescan the database to calculate the support level of the candidate itemsets. It scans the database only once to determine the 1-frequent itemsets and then uses only those frequent itemsets to generate the next stage candidate itemsets [12  3\Apriori Some items occur more often than others in the transaction database. MSApriori\(Multiple Support Apriori\ is an improved version of Apriori which considers the frequency of occurrence of individual item. In fact, this algorithm assigns ‘minimum item support \(MIS\ level to each item in order to take into account the frequency of occurrence of the individual item [8, 9   4\Occur \(Maximum Occurrence Earlier association rule mining algorithms did not consider recurrence issue. MaxOccur defines the association rules that consider the recurrent items when generating the kcandidate itemsets. The algorithm begins with finding the 1frequent itemsets. It then examines the frequency of recurrent items in the frequent itemset. The process continues to generate k-itemsets until it finds the predefined Maximum Occurrence’ item. The infrequent items that fail to meet the support level are removed from further processing 5\SAA \(Relative Support Apriori RSAA considers the relative frequency of occurrence 5,6 d u s es  t w o su pport v a l u es i n  t h e m i n i ng proces s   The first one \(min_sup_1\s the user defined ‘minimum support’ which is used to find the frequent itemsets. The items that do not meet this value are grouped into infrequent itemset. The second value is the ‘relative support min_sup_2\ which is used to evaluate the infrequent itemset and to see if they meet the relative support Min_sup_1’ must be greater than ‘min_sup_2.’ RSAA can also be applied to where there is a hierarchical relationship among the data items III  T RANSITIVE ASSOCIATION RULE DISCOVERY  A  Transitively associated relationship Suppose the Apriori algorithm produced the following 2candidate itemsets ‘{milk, bread}, {bread, toaster}, and milk, toaster}’ with the respective support values 50 40%, 30%. If we use 40% as the min_support, we get two 2-frequent itemsets’ out of the three ‘2-candidate itemsets i.e., {milk, bread} and {bread, toaster}. Here we note that the two association rules {milk, bread} and {bread, toaster combined together produce the transitive relation milk  toaster>. A high support is required for the transitive relation to hold. However, in this case, the support is only 30%, and so the {milk, toaster} itemset must be removed from further processing This paper is tuned to the development of an algorithm that retains the transitively associated itemsets as well as the normal frequent itemsets. The purpose is to discover useful and sometimes strategically important, patterns forsaken by the Apriori procedure and to utilize the recovered transitive associations as a useful knowledge for real world applications. As shown in the famous ‘beer and diaper episode of association rule mining [11  w e so m e ti m e s encounter difficulty in interpreting the semantics of the mining results. However, if we retain the transitive association rules, it may help us to find the missing links of an association. For example, the following two itemsets beer, milk} and {milk, diaper} may render a reasonable interpretation of the association between ‘beer and diaper Most of the association rule mining algorithms do not retain the semantically meaningful rules because they usually use the simple ‘support and confidence’ criteria. The milk 015 bread 015 toaster’ relation is a typical example which contains semantically meaningful transitive relationship but the {milk, toaster} itemset has to be removed from the frequent itemset. If we keep the transitively associated itemsets as the legitimate course of the association rule mining, we will be able to find out the items which have strategic importance in marketing and sales analysis B  The TSAA algorithm The ‘TSAA \(transitive support association Apriori algorithm of this paper utilizes the combination of Apriori and RSAA algorithms. It uses two minimum support values min_support \(minimum support\ and minRsup \(minimum relative support\. The algorithm begins with the same Apriori procedure in finding the 1-frequent itemsets. In the next step, we generate the 2-candidate itemsets and compare the support values against the min_support. If the itemset has a support value greater than the min_support, it is grouped into the frequent itemset. If not, it is stored in the infrequent itemsets, and we examine whether there is a transitive relationship. If there are two or more itemsets that lead to a transitive relation, they form the transitive itemsets TRD

In the next step, TSAA calculates the ‘relative support Rsup\’ to find any ‘transitively associated itemsets.’ The notations and definitions about the TSAA algorithm are as follows  C k k-candidate transitive itemsets C k1  C k2   C ki   C km   C kj j th k-candidate transitive itemset Rsup j relative support value of the j th transitive itemset TRDsup C kj the support value of the j th k-candidate transitive itemset minRsup: Minimum Relative Support \(user defined C k  0010 1  0010 2    0010 k  where 0010 i indicates an item Rsup j max{ TRDsup C kj sup 0010 1  TRDsup C kj sup 0010 2  TRDsup C kj sup 0010 3  TRDsup C kj sup 0010 k   If Rsup j is greater than minRsup C kj is grouped into the k-transitive itemset TRD k Suppose we have a transaction database as shown in Table 1. We apply the TSAA algorithm and calculate Rsup j for each of the candidate transitive itemset  Table 1  Sample transaction database TID Transaction Items 1 LCD_Monitor, LCD_TV, Perfume, MP3 2 LCD_TV, Cell-phone, Swimwear, Insurance 3 Perfume, Bed, LCD_Monitor 4 Cell_phone, Suitcase, Bed 5 LCD_Monitor, Swimwear, Sunglass, SunCream 6 Perfume, Bed, MP3, Cell_phone 7 Suitcase, Swimwear, Sunglass,MP3, Insurance 8 Perfume, Suitcase, Sunglass, MP3, Insurance 9 Cell_phone, Swimwear, Sunglass, SunCream Perfume 10 LCD_TV, Insurance 11 Perfume, Bed, Swimwear, Sunglass 12 Sunglass, SunCream, Insurance 13 LCD_Monitor, Suitcase, MP3 14 Cell_phone, Bed, SunCream 15 Suitcase, Swimwear, Sunglass,MP3 16 LCD_TV, Swimwear, Insurance, SunCream 17 LCD_TV, LCD_Monitor, Sunglass, Bed 18 Cell-phone, Swimwear, Sunglass, SunCream 19 LCD_TV, Suitcase, Sunglass, Perfume Swimwear 20 LCD_Monitor, Cell_phone, Perfume 21 Perfume, MP3, Swimwear, SunCream 22 LCD_Monitor, Swimwear, Sunglass, Insurance Suitcase 23 Cell-phone, Suitcase, Bed 24 MP3, Swimwear, Sunglass, SunCream 25 LCD_TV, Perfume, Suitcase, Insurance Table 2 shows the procedures for calculating the relative support Rsup j If minRsup=0.4, we obtain the transitive association itemsets TRD 2 perfume, swimwear swimwear, insurance}, {swimwear, suitcase}, {insurance suitcase}, {insurance, sunglass}}, and in the next step we obtain 3-frequent itemset {{swimwear, sunglass suncream}, {swimwear, suitcase, sunglass}, {suitcase sunglass, suncream}} and 3-transitive itemset {{perfume swimwear, insurance}, {suitcase, perfume, swimwear sunglass, swimwear, insurance}, {suitcase, sunglass insurance}}.

If customer i purchased item j, then the cell \(i, j\ is marked 1, otherwise 0. The TSAA algorithm was implemented using the programming feature of Microsoft Excel. Considering the support level of 1frequent itemsets we used 20% for ‘minimum support’ and 50% for ‘minimum relative support’ in our experiment Table 4 shows the result of TSAA algorithm application. It produced the k-frequent itemsets for k=1..4 exactly the same way that we would obtain from the Apriori algorithm. In addition, we obtained 11 ‘3-transitive itemsets’ as are shown at the bottom of Table 4 Observation of the 3-transitive itemsets {2, 6, 10}, {2, 6 11}, {2, 6, 12}, {2, 6, 18} in Table 4 reveals the new knowledge that item 6 \(Milk & beverage\ plays the linkage role between item 2 \(Bread\nd other items such as 10, 11 12, and 18 which represent ‘Ham & fish cake,’ ‘Sauce Liquor,’ and ‘Egg’ respectively. This knowledge may

provide us with some insight concerning the marketing strategy and shop floor layout design. Looking at the ‘3frequent itemsets’ in Table 4, we notice that items 6, 8, and 15 are transitive items. However, the list of ‘3-transitive itemset’ indicate that items 6, 10, 11, and 12 are also transitive items. So we notice that items 10, 11, and 12 could have been removed from transitivity consideration in case we used the Apriori algorithm only  Table 4.  Result of the TSAA algorithm     Figure 4.  Number of transitive association itemsets at various levels of minimum relative support  Fig. 4” shows the behavior of TSAA algorithm as we changed the level of minimum relative support.  This figure is obtained from other set of experiment data. However, it indicates that, depending on the transaction database D there is a minimum relative support level at which the number of transitive association items begins to drop sharply Another observation from this study is that when the size of transitive association itemset gets larger than 3, there comes the chance to have multiple join items. That is, two or more join items can appear in the higher-degree transitive association itemset. Although it suffices to have transitive associations among three items, further development of the algorithm would be necessary to derive a useful knowledge concerning multi-linkage transitive associations IV  C ONCLUSION  Transitive association rule mining is a novel approach to market basket analysis. It addresses the strategic issue that mining task is geared to the semantic relationship mining It is possible to modify the TSAA algorithm such that we may use different level of minimum support as the size of the itemset\(k\ets larger. As the itemset size gets larger, it will become harder to find itemsets that meet the minimum support level. Relaxing the minimum support level to a lower value might be a viable option to increase the possibility of getting more meaningful transitive association rules. Other modification of the algorithm, e.g., combination with MIS or Maxoccur is a likely possibility The TSAA algorithm for transitive association mining can be applied to marketing campaigns, sales promotion customer relationship management, and in many other areas The join \(linkage\ms in the transitively associated itemsets carry special meaning depending on the situation With a simple Excel programming of the TSAA algorithm we were able to obtain the transitive itemsets as well as the frequent itemsets. In this paper, the TSAA algorithm focused mainly on finding transitive association itemsets from the transaction database and a single userdefined minimum relative support value was used However, the algorithm can be further improved by adopting ‘weight adjusted minimum relative support’ in the future research. Currently, factors such as ‘profit margin customer satisfaction, and strategic marketing value’ are being considered as the candidate to the derivation of the weight adjusted minimum relative support R EFERENCES  1.

numerical attribute e  g the attribute Age which is generally in the range 0-100, can be divided into six sharp partitions namely 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75, 76 and above. In case of FACISME, fuzzy sets are used instead of sharp partitions, in order to convert numerical attributes to fuzzy partitions. The attribute Age can be divided into three fuzzy partitions, namely Young, Medium-aged, and Old, with each value of age belonging to each of the three fuzzy partitions with some membership value 265 Thus, the number of sharp partitions that need to be used to handle a numerical attribute is far greater than the number of fuzzy partitions required to do the same. Moreover, this leads to better understanding by the user as there are few well-defined fuzzy partitions with linguistic names/meanings like Young and Old, as opposed to sharp partitions which are less intuitive and to which a user cannot relate to immediately For the current analysis we have used two fuzzy partitions for all numerical attributes throughout all the datasets. As described in section 5.C, the time complexity of FACISME is quite high, because of which the time required to train a fuzzy classifier using FACISME is also high. Hence, we have used two fuzzy partitions so as to limit the training time. But, even with just two fuzzy partitions we have achieved quite high accuracies, as described above. More importantly, even with this, we achieved similar \(sometimes better results\s other state-of-the art classifiers used in this experimental analysis. The reason for these high accuracies is that FACISME is based on the theoretically sound and well-established maximum entropy framework  VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed a new classifier based on the paradigms of association rules mining and fuzzy logic  Though recent classifiers i nvolving association rules have shown their techniques to be accurate, their approaches to build a classifier either manifest unobserved statistical relationships in the dataset, or have no statistical basis at all FACISME uses the well-known maximum entropy principle and iterative scaling to build a statistical and robust theoretical model for classification Fuzzy Logic gives FACISME the capability to deal accurately and efficiently  with any type of datasets and domains, and in any kind of environments, which is not necessarily true for traditional crisp classifiers. Thus, using maximum entropy and fuzzy logic, FACISME provides very  good  accuracy and can work with all types of data irrespective of size and type of attributes \226 numerical or binary  REFERENCES 1  Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R.: Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
