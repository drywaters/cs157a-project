Shenyang Key Laboratory of Information Security for Power System Shenyang Institute of Engineering Shenyang, China E-mail: zhouzl@ihep.ac.cn   Abstract 227An important element of BBS public opinion analysis system is to update the contents of knowledge regular library dynamically adding sensitive words constantly to knowledge regular library. Apriori algorithm is classical algorithm of mining association rules. This paper presents a new method of 
adding the contents of knowledge regular automatically using association rule models. Experimental results show that the system obviously improves the accuracy of monitoring BBS public opinion by means of this algorithm Keywords-Knowledge regular library; Association rules; BBS public opinion analysis I   I NTRODUCTION  As a convenient, simple, direct method of communication BBS has been used by more and more people to express their views on certain events and attitudes with the increasing 
development of the Internet. Because of the anonymity of speaking, the freedom of speech and the immediacy of information on the BBS, the relevant departments must monitor and filter the BBS information on real-time. Most of the BBS Web sites are based on manual monitoring methods such as browsing and downloading from Internet, or directly copying and pasting the data from the database then analyzing it. Meanwhile, some scholars use vector space model clustering and BP neural network algorithm to analyze the hot topics. However, few specifical application systems are developed to monitor the contents of BBS 
1  BBS public opinion intelligent analysis systems use a minimum of manpower and material resources to achieve optimal effectiveness of public opinion analysis via automatically acquiring and classifying data, extracting keywords, analyzing hot topic and forecasting the trends of the view. BBS public opinion analysis systems, by which monitoring work is completed, achieve intelligent analysis of BBS public opinion efficiently. Ultimately, user, who need not track and monitor individual BBS manually, will be able to grasp the information which user need on the BBS timely 
accurately, comprehensively and objectively  The system needs to build a knowledge regular library to determine the sensitive words which can constitute some unscrupulous persons\222 provocative words while monitoring posts on the BBS. Due to the diversity and real-time of emergencies, system demands of the knowledge regular library not only to detect illegal post itself, but also be able to include those frequently used words, that is, the system requires the knowledge regular library to increase in a certain condition dynamically, and only in this way, the systems can 
detect sensitive posts more accurately. This paper obtained a period of posts about a topic from Netease BBS. Since the system updates knowledge regular library using Apriori algorithm, accuracy has been gr eatly improved compared with the method that all key words of each sensitive posts were added to the knowledge regular library directly II  P ROBLEM DESCRIPTION  BBS public opinion refers to the collection of emotions attitudes and opinions, which the public hold to the public things through BBS expression and dissemination. Because of 
the anonymity of speaking and the freedom of speech, there are plenty of reactionary remarks and pseudo information on the BBS. In order to create a clean and pure environment for the netizens, the relevant departments need to monitor, screen and filter the information on the BBS for processing the illegal acts and events in a timely manner to ensure social stability and unity of the people  978-1-4244-5326-9/10/$26.00 \2512010 IEEE 


The work of BBS public opinion monitoring, filtering and analysis is difficult to be completed by hand because of BBS diversity and complexity of information. The relevant departments need special software which can analyze and filter information automatically to accomplish these tasks to save manpower costs. BBS public opinion intelligent analysis system can achieve the functions including BBS information automatic acquisition, automatic classification, automatically extract keywords and automatic analysis. The system requires a knowledge regular library to determine the sensitive words to further determine sensitive posts, and dynamically updating the knowledge regular library can enhance the accuracy of determining and the efficiency of matching III  A PRIORI ALGORITHM INTRODUCTION  The itemset refers to a collection of items. The support of itemset in a transaction database is the fraction of all transactions containing the itemset. The confidence of the rule is the fraction of all transactions containing X that also contain Y   Association rules is rules that have support and confidence greater or equal to user-specified threshold respectively. An itemset is called frequent if its support is greater or equal to user-specified support threshold 2 Discovering association rules need to find all the frequent itemsets and generate the rule that the confidence of frequent itemsets is greater or equal to confidence threshold. Apri ori algorithm is classical algorithm of discovering association rules. The Apriori algorithm, introduced by Agrawal, has been widely used to mine useful knowledge in large transaction database Knowledge is derived in terms of a list of association rules 3  One of Apriori algorithm natures is that a subset of frequent itemset must be a frequent itemset. Apriori algorithm finds potential frequent itemsets through frequent itemsets known. Potential frequent itemset is composed by the set which is likely to be a frequent itemset. Hence systems only need to calculate the support of the potential frequent itemsets instead of the support of all the different items to reduce the computational complexity 4  IV  A PPLYING A PRIORI ALGORITHM TO BBS PUBLIC OPINION ANALYSIS SYSTEM  To apply association rule mining to the problem of updating knowledge regular library of BBS public opinion analysis system intelligently, system assumes that each post can be seen as a transaction while each key word of post can also be seen as item. Applying Apriori algorithm to a forum or some forums with specified support and confidence, and the system can determine a sensitive post if the post includes sensitive words. Simultaneously, examining the other key words of the post, the system adds the words of which the support and confidence are greater or equal to the specified threshold to the knowledge regular library to automatically update knowledge regular library Assuming that a post has n key words, Fig.1 gives the specific process of automatically updating knowledge regular library with Apriori algorithm   Figure 1  The process of automatically updating knowledge regular library with Apriori algorithm  V  P RELIMINARY EXPERIMENT AND RESULT  System accessed recent posts about the topic  Tibetan separatist remarksî on the BBS. Assuming that the key words of a post include ìTibetan separatistî, ìAmericaî, ìincite defectionî and ìthe EUî, the words ìTibetan separatistî and incite defectionî which exist knowledge regular library are sensitive words. So the post is judged as sensitive post, then system examines the other key words of this post, the words Americaî and ìthe EUî are not in the knowledge regular library. Through system calculating, the supports of these two key words were 38% and 17%. Assuming the system-specified support threshold is 30%, and the confidences of these words are greater to the system-specified confidence threshold respectively. So the word ìAmericaî is sensitive word which needs to be added to the knowledge regular library, but ìthe EUî is not sensitive word temporarily If the system adds all the key words of each post to the knowledge regular library directly without analyzing the key words of post in advance, the knowledge regular library will become very large, and the accuracy rate and the speed of the matching of the key words will be reduced. Suppose in the previous example, the system added all the words of the post to the knowledge regular library without analyzing the words Americaî and ìthe EUî using Apriori algorithm, it would bring error to the judgment   whether the other posts are sensitive. Only the system analyzes the key words of posts based on the empirical knowledge, and then adds words which meet certain conditions to the knowledge regular library, can we identify the sensitive posts more accurately and efficiently  


Fig.2 gives some results of the experiments. The system acquired the posts about ìTibetan separatistî from November 20, 2009 to December 22 on the Netease BBS. The duplicate posts have been deleted. Library 1 was obtained through the Apriori algorithm and library 2 was obtained through adding all the key words of each sensitive post to the knowledge regular library. The X-Coordinate stands for support while the Y-Coordinate stands for the accuracy in Fig.2. The system identifies sensitive posts using the two libraries respectively Fig.2 below gives some results of the accuracy of the judgment  Figure 2  Accuracy of identifying posts under the different support conditions From Fig.2, it is not difficult to see that, compared with the accuracy rate of the method of adding all the key words of each sensitive post to the knowledge regular library, the accuracy rate of the method of using Apriori algorithm to generate knowledge regular library is higher, while the choice of different support will affect the accuracy rate VI  C ONCLUSION  The system updates knowledge regular library dynamically with Apriori algorithm to improve the method that knowledge regular library depends on manual input and mechanically adding new words, so the system can determine the sensitive posts more accurately from a mount of posts. Meanwhile, the system decreases the contents of the knowledge regular library, reduces the capacity of the library and improves the efficiency of identification and the accuracy rate of identifying sensitive posts  R EFERENCES   1  YAO Xiao-na.

C Application and Argumentation  of IARAFP in Intelligent Tutoring System An intelligent tutoring system based on association rules ITSAR\ is designed as Fig.3. ITSAR includes four subsystems or modules: an interface module, an expert module, a student module, and a teacher module. It provides a test and studying platform that learners could examine themselves by doing the test que stions, and gain the feedback results of grade and evaluation that can guide learners to review weak knowledge points. There are many databases stored relative itemsets in each module  Figure 3.  An intelligent tutoring system based on association rules Before association rules mining, preprocessing should be done. First, the test questions are decomposed into many knowledge points be looked as items according to Chinese word segmentation dictionary algorithm  Then, some fields can be represented by code name respectively in order to mine expediently and take off useless fields. After preprocessing, each record has an itemset, the data in temset are ranked by alphabets. Association rules mining are executed on itemsets We implement IARAFP at the environment of Delphi 7.0 and Access 2003 of DBMS. In our experiments, we select a course-data structure as test object. The database gathered 382 knowledge points and 1469 unique test questions and 196 students. Through a round test, the number of records is 32 what the grade is excellent. Assuming min-supp is 2%, as well as known antecedent and consequent, then running the IARAFP algorithm, we get Table 1 From Table 1, we can deduce the association degree between the right knowledge points \(listed in antecedent\ and the excellent grade \(listed in consequent\. Through setting dissimilar antecedents, consequents and minimum support degree, different mining outcomes can be gained. And from those outcomes, the relations between teachers and student's grade, students' study habit and grades and so on can be analyzed Rules on mining can be made process on different granularity, such as class, specialty and teacher and things According to the association at different granularity, we can judge the sorts of results, for example, a class of learning, a teacher's teaching, and then curricular difficulties could be found which can advise proposals to students and teachers Fig.4 is a learner exercise's feedback interface in our system as feedback results, the learner gains proposals of further learning TABLE I A SSOCIATION R ULES OF  GRADE E XCELLENT  sequence number antecedent \( Knowledge points of answer is  right consequent support confidence 1 circular linked lists \\stack \\ character string \\binary tree storage \\preorder traversal of binary tree \\postorder traversal of binary tree\\undirected graph \\graph adjacency lists storage depth-first traversal graph \\minimum spanning tree \\sequential search \\selection sort bubble sorting grade=çExcellenté 3.57 87.50 2 circular linked lists \\stack \\ character string \\binary tree storage \\preorder traversal of binary tree \\postorder traversal of binary tree \\undirected graph \\graph adjacency lists storage depth-first traversal of graph \\minimum spanning tree \\sequential search \\selection sort quick sort grade Excellent 3.06% 66.67 3 circular linked lists \\stack \\ character string \\binary tree storage \\preorder traversal of binary tree \\postorder traversal of binary tree \\undirected graph \\graph adjacency lists storage depth-first traversal of graph \\minimum spanning tree \\Sequential Search \\binary search grade Excellent 2.55% 35.71 4 stack \\ character string \\binary tree storage \\preorder traversal of binary tree \\postorder traversal of binary tree \\undirected graph \\graph adjacency lists storage \\depth-first traversal of graph \\minimum spanning tree \\sequential search \\selection sort grade Excellent 2.55% 29.41 5 binary tree storage \\preorder traversal of binary tree \\inorder traversal of binary tree undirected graph \\graph adjacency lists storage \\depth-first traversal of graph \\minimum spanning tree \\sequential search \\selection sort grade Excellent 2.55% 20.83 6 binary tree storage \\inorder traversal of binary tree \\undirected graph \\graph adjacency lists storage \\depth-first traversal of graph \\minimum spanning tree \\sequential search \\selection sort grade Excellent 2.04% 12.90  Volume 6 2010 2nd International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology V6-463 


Figure 4.  A feedback interface of exercise The results of experiments show that our algorithm can be applied to ITS and manifest its accuracy and robustness while mine association rules among the data in the ITS IV C ONCLUSION ITS based on data mining can guide students autonomic learning, and help students discover weakness in knowledge structures, so that it can advance students' comprehensive use of intellectual ability to solve problems. A large number of data in the system will also help students learning some common problems, even the personalized, so as to improve teaching effect. This paper proposed an improved association rules mining algorithm based on FP-growth ÖIARAFP which applied to our designed ITSDM. The results of practical application proved that IARAFP can accelerate the speed of discovering frequent patterns and enable learners quickly find unmastered knowledge. Further, the system can help learners to consolidate and review, and effectively improve the teachers' teaching level, at the same time, enhance the teaching quality monitoring A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work presented in this paper is supported by the Education Research Project of Anhui Provincial Education Department \(No. 2007jyxm448 and 2 007jyxm115 R EFERENCES 1 A   I n gra m  Us i n g w e b s e r v er logs  i n eva l u a t i n g in s t r u ct i ona l w e b  sites", Journal of Educational Technology Systems, vol. 28, n.2 pp.137-157, 2000 2 Y  Oc hi  Y Ya n o Y T  Ha y a sh i T   R  W a k i t a  JUP I T E R  A  K a n j i Learning Environment Focusing on a Learner's Browsing".

locate    s conditional PLMS-tree in the mining of sequence     s super-patterns. In line 7 through 9, we examine the mps of each node n and record their minimum mps  This value will be used in next step In line 12 through line 18, secondly, we generate candidate patterns and output sequential patterns according to each item  s icount  Three conditions may occur here. The first is that the icount satisfies MIS   This sequence is directly appended to the sequential patterns set. The second is that the icount doesn  t satisfy MIS  t satisfies mps That is, the sequence is currently not a sequential pattern, but its super-pattern \(i.e appending suffix in the sequence\ has possibility to be Therefore, both two conditions have to keep growing and recursively call procedure MSCP-growth for further examining their super-patterns. The third is that the count of sequence doesn  t satisfy both MIS  nd mps It means that any superpattern of the sequence  will never be a sequential pattern The procedure will terminate while the root set becomes empty We use the constructed PLMS-tree in Fig.12 to explain the mining process in detail. At first, the RS is root and we trace all nodes belong to the first item e in HT According to the nlink of item e from HT  we find \(_ e 1:11111001 n 1 at first, the position code shows that n 1 is a descent node of RS and n 1 is not recounted in the same branch n 1  icount will be add into icount since n 1 does not have any child node, no node will be joined into nRS According to the nlink in \(_ e 1:11111001\ the next node \(_ e 2:101 n 2 will be found n 2 is a descent node of root and n 2 is not recounted n 2  icount will be added into icount  n 2 also has a child node \(_ c 2:1011 that can be joined into the nRS to be a new root set if we need to growth this pattern. And the next node \(_ e 1:10111011\ is recounted so the node count of this node will not be added into icount  Since the icount of item e is 60% which reaches the candidate growth condition we mentioned before, we use the nRS and e as a candidate pattern to generate new patterns. Pattern e also reaches the threshold of sequential pattern, i.e. MIS e and can be joined into the sequential patterns set. The second step uses the node in the nRS _ c 2:1011\, as the new root set of conditional tree to growth new pattern\(s\. According to HT the icount of first item e rooted by \(_ c 2:1011 is 20%, which does not reach the candidate growth condition. The icount of second item c in HT rooted by \(_ c 2:1011\ is 40%, which reaches the condition to growth new candidate patterns, so we use the child nodes of _ c 2:1011 _ a 1:10111\nd \(_ b 1:10111 as nRS to generate new candidate patterns. This pattern also larger than MIS ec  which means it can be joined into the sequential patterns set The complete sequential patterns set with beginning item e can be generated by repeating these steps The reason we use the mps value and candidate growth will show in following example. We trace the item b now, the icount of item b is 100% which reaches the condition to generate new candidate and the threshold to be joined into the sequential patterns set. As the tracing step goes, we have the icount of item d 60% in the suffix tree of pattern b it reaches the mps value=30%, which is the second condition to candidate growth we mentioned before, and it means that this pattern still has possibility to be part of sequential pattern. Noted that it doesn  treach MIS bd 65%, which means it is not a sequential pattern. In the next candidate growth step, we have item e with icount 40% which reaches the MIS bde 30%, pattern bde  can be joined into the sequential patterns set. We can see that an infrequent patternês super set become frequent pattern in this case, that is why we need to consider about the mps value The other sequential patterns which are started from other items are generated in the same way. Finally, we can have the complete sequential patterns with MMS by MSCP-growth algorithm V C ONCLUTION In this study, we first address the rare item problem in the mining of sequential patterns. To generate more interesting patterns, we extend the concept of MMS on sequential pattern mining and propose an algorithm, named MSCP growth, to discover complete set of sequential pattern with MMS In experimental study, we will compare three well-known traditional methods, including GSP, PrefixSpan and PLWAPtree with MSCP-growth using several synthetic datasets as well as real-life datasets Some r esearch directions are briefly discussed. First, users may have to tune items  supports many times while discovering useful patterns. Instead of restarting the whole mining process, it is valuable if a support tuning mechanism can be developed. Second, the concept of MMS can be further applied to cons traint-based sequential pattern mining, such as time constraints or duration constraints A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the National Science Council of the Republic of China under the Grant NSC 982410-H-194-054 R EFERENCES 1 Y  H Hu and Y L  C h en   M ini ng a s s o c i at i o n ru les w i t h m u lt ip le minimum supports: a new mining algorithm and a support tuning mechanism Decision Support Systems vol. 42, is. 1 pp.1-24, 2006 2 R  A g ra w a l a n d R Srik ant   M in in g s e qu en ti a l pa tt ern s    Data Engineering \(ICDEê95  Taipei, Taiwan, Mar, 1995, pp.3-14 3 J.

From summary comparisons of different models, PSR, PLSA, LDA, and OWL are all of semantic richness, but only PSR can be constructed automatically.
