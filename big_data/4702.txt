2 In addition to the need to improve raw computational performance both military and civilian space agencies have determined spacecraft flexibility is key to meeting divergent mission objectives with minimal cost and risk Multiuse payloads can support the needs of multiple users while reducing non-recurring engineering and increasing mission survivability

C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1202 Version 1 Updated October 19 2007 To meet flexibility and resilience objectives some researchers have chosen to develop adaptable software that executes on fixed 
hardware resources For example poweraware computing is a straightforward software management approach whereby the prioritized processing requirements of applications are matched against component power usage and reserves to optimize performance/Watt 3 This approach provides a simple means for multiple applications to share hardware resources but lacks flexibility and fault tolerance Environmentally Adaptive Fault Tolerant Computing 4 is another software-based approach recently developed that focuses on mission fault tolerance along with resource management The middleware deployed on these systems measures and predicts the radiation environment in which the 
spacecraft is traveling prioritizes mission requirements based on this data and then deploys applications in a manner that optimizes fault tolerance versus performance 5 While this approach provides an improvement in system flexibility boardand device-level hardware redundancy was necessary to achieve an acceptable level of fault tolerance in the deployed system 6 A mixture of software mechanisms and hardware redundancy is likely to be the best overall solution for most programs but limiting the scope to which hardware is replicated is critical to avoiding 
unnecessary increases in weight power bulk etc Several related projects have proposed new techniques that allow spacecraft to adapt to emergent and changing mission requirements by providing hardware flexibility and fault tolerance with limited redundancy The so called Flexible Mission Spacecraft FMS concept has been proposed as a means to reduce design re-engineering by promoting system flexibility with minimal redundancy 7 Some proposed FMS solutions focus on building plug-and-play subsystems 8 while others focus within the processing subsystem The Adaptive Avionics Experiment AAE project 
led by AFRL focuses on the responsive space mission by proposing a design that includes a collection of signal processors whose input can be dynamically changed to receive data from one of several sensor suites 9 Generic sensor interfaces provide a means to easily tailor the base architecture to a specific mission's sensors Though the system did not have a successful flight the AAE design served as a good first step toward an FMS in support of responsive space missions 1 


Building on the AAE design the Advanced Responsive Tactically Effective Military Imaging Spectrometer ARTEMIS is another payload processing system that is designed for the FSM mission ARTEMIS processor supports application independent processing by coupling compute-intensive Field-Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs with a powerful PowerPC-based general-purpose processor ARTEMIS adaptable architecture provides flexibility when tailoring the system design to meet the needs of various missions and allows for in-situ reconfigurability to vastly improve system fault tolerance The ARTEMIS payload is scheduled to launch on the AFRL TacSat-3 mission in 2008 This paper outlines the ARTEMIS payload processor and highlights its performance and flexibility The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows Section 2 describes the ARTEMIS architecture and Section 3 highlights the flexibility of the ARTEMIS processor A discussion of plans to deploy ARTEMIS on the upcoming TacSat-3 mission is given in Section 4 and Section 5 concludes the paper 2 ARTEMIS PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE The ARTEMIS processor is an AFRL funded project that seeks to develop a general-purpose signal processing platform that pushes the boundaries of payload performance adaptability and survivability The key system objectives proposed by the program include 0 0 0 0 0 0 Support scalable processing from 9 to 400 GFLOPS On-orbit system reconfigurability Incorporation of open standards SEE and TID tolerant Flexible I/0 architecture to ease mission tailoring User interface supporting rapid development The main components of the ARTEMIS processor system architecture are shown in Figure 1 Interfaces between components within the ARTEMIS processor include power plane Compact Peripheral Component Interconnect cPCI and Spacewire for command and data handling instructions C&DH and high speed serial to support fast data processing The ARTEMIS processor interacts with other spacecraft components via several external interfaces including SV 28V power Spacewire and RS422 for spacecraft C&DH Gigabit Ethernet GigE for uplink commands and downlink data and sensor connections that can interface via a wide array of standards using adaptable mezzanine connectors Several custom interfaces have been developed and interfaced through the adaptable sensor connector including LVDS camera links for a Hyperspectral Imager HSI and a High Resolution Imager HRI other digital interfaces for a mass data storage board and a focus mechanism as well as an analog input for a position sensor The ability to support such a wide array of devices is testament to the versatility of the adaptable sensor connector Power SUDDIV UPS Spacewire I RS422 I GPS Figure 1 ARTEMIS Processor System Architecture 2 


Four types of boards compose the ATERMIS processor system including a power supply a Universal Power Switch UPS a G4-based single-board computer G4-SBC and a Responsive Avionics Reconfigurable Computer RA-RCC board The power supply receives the space vehicle 28V power and outputs regulated 3.3V 5V 15V and 15V as required by the other boards in the system The UPS takes in the space vehicle 28V power and receives commands via the SEAKR Serial Bus to switch the power to redundant payload power planes and individual payload sensor components such as cameras Power switching commands are passed from the G4-SBC to the RA-RCC via the cPCI bus The RA-RCC then passes the commands to the UPS via the SEAKR Serial Bus Redundant power supplies and UPSs can be included if required by a mission's fault tolerance requirements The total power budget for the ARTEMIS processor and sensors is 47W The G4-SBC manages external interfaces to the spacecraft and up/down links controls system configuration and orchestrates data processing A block diagram of the G4SBC board architecture is shown in Figure 2 The board consists of the Freescale MPC7457 processor with 32KB of LI cache 256 KB of L2 cache and an internal Alta-Vec coprocessor a PC107A memory controller and PCI bridge a support FPGA that provides Error Detection and Correction EDAC protected interfaces to three types of memory and an RS422 LVDS interface cPCI and SpaceWire interfaces and a GigE PMC interface The G4SBC provides 600 DMIP sustained performance 256 MB of SDRAM 1GB of Flash memory greater than 3OKrad radiation tolerance and consumes a maximum of 15W The G4-SBC receives commands from the SpaceWire or RS422 interface and controls the rest of the system JTAG I headed trhahlatcr 6bMAHZ 60X Ibcal bus EORRM R 2 MT IDRAMN  I i 751'2M1 j Ethqernet PMC 33MHZ PCI bu 4 33MHz _ os S acere LVDS 2 Port External Clockl and Enable Bikblt[ane OrneCtors Figure 2 G4-SBC Board Architecture The primary functions of the RA-RCC are to control the payload sensor functionality perform on-board processing of the sensor data and to control power switching of the sensors and nonvolatile mass data storage The RA-RCC board architecture is shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 Responsive Avionics Reconfigurable Computer RA_RCC Board Architecture 3 


The board contains four FPGAs including one Actel RTAX2000 and three Xilinx V4 LX160 coprocessors COPs The radiation tolerant Actel provides a PCI-to-PCI bridge between the back plane and the local PCI bus interconnecting three COP FPGAs The Actel also controls configuration management and scrubbing of the COPs via the SelectMap interface as well as the 4Gb bank of tripleredundant Flash memory used for configuration program storage and a 512Mb bank of triple redundant SDRAM used for system configuration management The Actel also controls the serial bus interface for the UPS card which controls the power state of the payload sensors Each COP controls and has access to a 256MB bank of Reed-Solomon EDAC protected DDR2-SDRAM available for processing applications The COPs also interface to adaptable high-speed mezzanine interfaces that can connect them to sensors or additional memory or system interconnections At present the ARTEMIS processor connects to a 16GB bank of Reed-Solomon EDAC protected NAND Flash two camera links for camera control and receipt of the high rate image data current drive for opto-isolator control lines for the focus mechanism stepper motor controller and analog position telemetry from the focus mechanism via mezzanine cards as previously described Also custom LVDS I/0 interfaces are implemented between the COPs to improve inter-processor communication Due to the flexibility of FPGAs all of these interfaces may be enabled or disabled as required by the mission without changing board hardware layouts These adaptable interfaces provide a cost-effective way to customize the ARTEMIS core components for a wide range of missions The COP FPGAs also provide front-end signal processing and/or payload processing in conjunction with the G4-SBC FPGAs provide a fabric upon which a variety of highperformance signal processing algorithms can be deployed Libraries of predefined functions are available or the developer can build custom functionality as required A B C The flexible nature of these devices allow the system to adapt to late developing requirements or changing on-orbit conditions such as algorithm updates and degraded mode requirements due to catastrophic hardware failure 3 ARTEMIS PROCESSOR FLEXIBILITY Figure 4 shows several of the many I/0 options the RARCC flexible mezzanine interconnect provides Any one of the COPs can be connected to one or more mission-specific devices via tailored mezzanine cards and interface logic developed for the COP The setup shown in Figure 4A shows one setup option whereby each COP is independently interfaced to one or more dedicated resources This setup provides a simple design but does not guard against mechanical failures on the input channels unless some external redundancy mechanism is employed A second option Figure 4B provides maximum redundancy and flexibility with all sensor inputs available to be switched to any of the COPs This setup provides the ability to fully bypass a hardware failure with a COP or mezzanine card interface Due to the reconfigurable nature of FPGAs logic resources need not be wasted within the COPs to support each potential interface at all times In-situ reconfiguration can occur on an as needed basis to support degraded modes This option also facilitates fully replicated processing of input data Another option Figure 4C provides a hybrid between the two previous approaches supporting a mixture of redundancy as mission requirements dictate Figure 4D shows another option where physical separation between redundant interfaces can be achieved with the use of an additional mezzanine card or other means of interconnection In this configuration the two COPs on the ends are physically isolated while the center COP can support redundancy or additional processing in either I/0 domain D EF Figure 4 Select COP I/0 Fault Tolerance Options 4 mgmilmr-Am mgmmmmg-m Mr

The TacSat1 mission took the first step toward improving responsive space capability and also expanded SIPRNET to space and the TacSat-2 mission provided a space-based common data link for tactical communications 13 TacSat3 will expand the program's capabilities by deploying a standard component interconnect bus demonstrating initial component plug and play ability and including a land-focused Hyperspectral imaging HSI payload 14 The ARTEMIS payload will provide the HSI sensor and application processing capability for the TacSat-3 mission scheduled to launch in 2008 Future TacSat missions will focus on improving payload capabilities extending dwelling time in LEO and link to other satellite programs such as T-SAT The HSI payload onboard TacSat-3 consists of a telescope an imaging spectrometer and a high resolution imager that combine to produce raw high resolution images This payload unit is captured by the ATEMIS Sensor box in Figure 6 The HSI data collected from the sensor is processed by the Sensor Processor shown in Figure 6 which consists of one ARTEMIS payload processor as shown in Figure 1 HSI allows for spectral match indication and identification which provides anomaly detection within a given scene that allows the warfighter to distinguish manmade materials from natural materials among other benefits A fundamental capability of the ARTEMIS payload is to autonomously process HSI data and produce tactically relevant data for dissemination directly to the warfighter in the form of text or imagery as the situation requires The goals of achieving responsive space capabilities motivated all aspects of the ARTEMIS sensor and processor payload development Design trades were carefully evaluated at each step with cost and schedule impacts of foremost consideration The resulting sensor maintains technical performance while containing costs even with a rapid development schedule of twelve months 14 ARTEMIS provides a foundation for high-performance and flexible payload system design that meets the TacSat development program's responsive space objectives An innovative aspect used to control cost and schedule is to decouple payload processing capabilities from the spacecraft sensors As previously described the ARTEMIS processor employs mezzanine connectors with flexible hardware interfacing to connect sensors to processing resources Also by decoupling the sensor from the processor the ARTEMIS payload can be deployed on divergent spacecraft architectures without redesigning the sensors only a re-spin of the processor board to accommodate any additional interfaces e.g VME backplane is required Also this decoupling allows for a smooth transition when future versions of the processing or sensor boards are developed Such flexibility will allow future missions to quickly augment sensors and processing capabilities around the core payload architecture deployed on TacSat-3 The ARTEMIS payload processor is a key technology to enabling the responsive space mission and is actively being investigated for additional mission S QIL 31run 51a1b 4 LV I ntorfa-d Figure 6 TacSat-3 Architecture c/o AFRL 14 6 TC AF$CN qzzzzz WTML rcwd 51alkm

needs and expectations of the stakeholders in this project It also outlines the system's components technologies and functions based on these considerations Requirements This section describes the bushfire monitoring system's requirements developed through consultation with the interested parties of this project including the CFS They expressed their keen interest in a system that gives them near real time information on smouldering embers which have the potential to ignite into a fire They believe that this will help them fight fires in a safer and more effective manner The requirements developed through this consultation are that the hotspot detection system  Be relatively inexpensive when compared to other types of bushfire monitoring systems such as satellite piloted aircraft or large UAVs  Be reliable robust and lightweight with low power consumption  Have the payload capacity to carry the required communications processing and sensing hardware  Have reasonable flight time and range  Be setup launched and operated by CFS personnel within 2 to 3 hours of notification of a fire outbreak  Fly autonomously by remote control or via a preplanned flight path as well as being able to switch between these modes as required throughout a mission  Automatically detect and track any hotspots in the area of interest  Gather video data of hotspots in both the infrared and visual spectrums  Process the hotpot data in both visual and infrared spectrums in near real time  Communicate any data collected and processed to the CFS incident command in near real time  Display the UAV's information for CFS incident command to allow for remote piloting if required  Display the true position of any fire and hotspots in the area of interest  Display the current local area weather and wind information of the area of interest  Display the infrared visual and image fusion video of the fire and hotspots as required  Display the required hotspot and fire information over digital maps of the local area to help give it context if desired  Provide a user interface that is easy to use understand and that aids the CFS in the decision making and fire fighting process The next section describes the hotspot detection system that meets the above requirements System Description This section takes the requirements from the previous section and proposes a hotspot detection system that meets these requirements and the needs and expectations of the stakeholders in this project The hotspot detection system will consist of a general computing platform such as a laptop This computing platform will be located at CFS incident command It will contain the user interface for the system and a database of all necessary digital maps It will also have the ability to retrieve local weather and wind information The system's user interface will be designed to be easy to use understand and to help the CFS in fire fighting and the decision making process The system will display the position of any hotspots in the current search area It will also provide video streams of these hotspots in infrared visual and image fusion formats The system will display collated local weather and wind information The system will additionally display the UAV flight data to enable the remote piloting of the UAV if required The system will furthermore present CFS incident command with this information in real time All this information will be presented either individually collectively or as visual representations on digital maps of the fire area This will reduce the cognitive load on the user of the system thus providing effortless perception of the information in an easy to understand context The system will therefore facilitate fighting fires in a safer and more effective manner As stated previously one of the best ways to gather information about bushfires is from the air However this can be ineffective and even perilous for pilots due to high unpredictable winds hazardous terrain as well as smoke obscuring both the fire and the terrain This research will provide fire fighters with real-time information they require without risking expensive aircraft or pilot's lives in these dangerous conditions This aim can be achieved by using a relatively inexpensive autonomous UAV 42 equipped with FPGA hardware for image processing from infrared and visual sensor packages This UAV platform will use this payload to acquire process and then transmit the required information to the fire fighters displaying hotspots even when obscured by smoke This ensures that they can 9

5 CONCLUSION The paper first highlighted the problem of bushfires and the need for research into detection and tracking of hotspots It defined a hotspot as a firebrand or smouldering ember that has the potential to ignite a fire It then explored the current literature on bushfires bushfire monitoring fire fighting uninhabited aerial vehicles UAV reconfigurable computing RC computer vision infrared imaging and visual tracking This knowledge base in conjunction with consultation with the South Australian CFS and other interested parties was used to develop requirements for a system that can detect and track hotspots The data collection and testing for this research was described as being conducted in 3 phases The first phase is data collection for characterisation of hotspots The second phase is the collection of aerial IR and visual spectrum data used for development and testing of hotspot detection and tracking algorithms The third phase is the testing of the prototype hotspots detection system and its components in simulated and real world conditions These success criteria for hotspots detection and tracking algorithms were defined as the algorithms accuracy decomposability processing speed and suitability The requirements of the hotspot detection system are that it be inexpensive reliable robust and lightweight when compared to other types of bushfire monitoring systems such as satellite piloted aircraft or large UAVs The system is able to be setup launched and operated by CFS personnel within 2 to 3 hours of notification of a fire outbreak It will automatically detect and track a hotspot in the wake of a fire It can communicate this data to the CFS incident command in near real time It displays the infrared visual and image fusion video of the hotspot as required It will have a user interface that is easy to use understand and that aids the CFS in the decision making and fire fighting process The hotspot detection system and its components were described The requirements were then used to justify the choice of these components and technologies in the hotspot detection system 6 FUTURE WORK Future research opportunities include conducting the data collection and testing for characterising of hotspots Conducting test flights that simulate UAV hotspot detection missions using an aircraft equipped with a FLIR camera to gather the required data Then test image processing algorithms and refine them based on the test results Implement the best performing algorithm in the hotspot detection system Test the Implementation of the algorithm in the system using the available test data Undertake test flights of the UAV platform to obtain and refine the system's optimal mission performance requirements for detecting and monitoring of bushfires Implement the communications infrastructure of the bushfire monitoring system Develop and implement the user interface of the of system Test the final prototype of the hotspot detection system Implement a swarm of UAVs for the system to giving the system a wider coverage area longer mission durations and more flexibility Develop a distributed operating system utilising the UAVs onboard FPGAs to control and reconfigure the UAV swarm completely autonomously or with communications from the system's base station Expand the system to implement full bushfire monitoring REFERENCES 1 EMA 2005 Eyre Peninsula Bushfire Emergency Management Australia\(EMA Attorney-General's Department Australian Government Canberra 26th July 2007  2 Tsikas M 2006 Fire fighters protect houses from a bushfire on the Central Coast of NSW on New Year's day Photograph Epoch Times Australia viewed 5th October 2006 3 ABS 2004 1301.0 Year Book Australia 2004 Bushfires Australian Bushfire Statistics 2004 updated 24 March 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics ABS Canberra viewed 23rd May 2007  4 McAneney J.K 2005 Australian bushfire Quantifying and pricing the risk to residential properties paper presented at the Symposium on Planning for Natural Hazards How Can We Mitigate the Impacts University of Wollongong 2-5 February 2005 5 Rodriguez Y Silva F and A Moreno Robles EUFIRELAB Euro-Mediterranean Wildland Fire Laboratory a wall-less Laboratory for Wildland Fire Sciences and Technologies in the EuroMediterranean Region The infrared imager its use for wildland fire monitoring D-09-04 2006 EUFIRELAB p 30 6 Rodriguez Y Silva F EUFIRELAB EuroMediterranean Wildland Fire Laboratory a wallless  Laboratory for Wildland Fire Sciences and Technologies in the Euro-Mediterranean Region Infrared imager its interest for wildland fire monitoring D-07-07 2005 EUFIRELAB p 28 the Bush fire system Develop test plan for the complete 11

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.
