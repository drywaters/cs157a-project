     Abstract 227 Reliability of the Fuzzy Association Rules \(FARs extraction is a challenging research in knowledge discovery and data mining. Reliability refers to the trade-off between the prediction accuracy and the rules diversity. In this paper, an approach called Diverse Fuzzy Rule Base \(DFRB\ is proposed to extract the FARs which are used later to predict the future values. This approach also aims to ensure high quality and diversity of the FARs. This is achieved through four phases firstly, the integration of Fuzzy C-Means \(FCM\nd Multiple Support Apriori \(MSapriori\lgorithms are applied to extract the FARs. The second phase calculates the correlation values for these FARs, and performs an efficient orientation for filtering FARs as a post-processing method. In the third phase the FARs diversity is maintained through the clustering of FARs, based on the concept of the sharing function technique used in multi-objectives optimization. After that, the best and the most diverse FARs are evaluated and then stored in the Knowledge Base \(KB\. Finally, these FARs, stored in the KB are utilized within the Fuzzy Inference System \(FIS\r prediction. Experimental results for two case studies have shown that the proposed DFRB approach predicted the future values effectively, thus, outperforming the existing work I  I NTRODUCTION ssociation mining remains one of the most important techniques in Knowledge Discovery in Databases KDD\creasingly attracting the attention of researchers Mining of the association rules can be applied to predict the future value in a particular domain. Association rules can be constructed as where is the antecedent \(left hand side\d is the consequent \(right hand side\. The association rules are extracted from a database which relies on two metrics \(interestingness measures\nimum Support threshold minsupp and Minimum Confidence threshold minconf Since minsupp is the time frequency for particular item\(s\hat are divided by the number of transactions, and minconf is the percentage value of the support value for the antecedent and consequent together divided by the support value of the antecedent part Association rules mining can be divided into two main parts   200  Frequent item sets are found if the support value of the itemset is greater than or equal to minsupp  200  Association rules are extracted if the confidence value of the frequent itemset is greater than or equal to minconf  The definition of the association rules is as follows: let  be a set of distinct items \(attributes\nd  B.

The membership functions are defined using different methods, basically, based on human experience/know-how  Ho w e v e r, in  m a ny occas io n s  it is too difficult to obtain the information required and the human experts. The Fuzzy C-Means \(FCM\ a clustering technique commonly used to provide reliable membership values for constructing fuzzy sets 7] if data s e t s ar e  available The use of single minsupp for a whole database considers and assumes that all items in the database have the same frequency. However, in real applications, the database contains some items of a high frequency, while others are of a low frequency. The human expert, based on domain knowledge, can set minsupp for a specific value in order to find the frequent items. In that case, if minsupp is set too high it will extract a low number of frequent items. On one hand, the rare items will appear and cause a dilemma \(called rare item problem\n the other hand, if minsupp is set too low, it will extract a high number of frequent items, which causes combinatorial explosions. In other words, all the possible associations will be found; thus, some of the items are uninteresting/insignificant [8 In th e literatu re, th e rare item problem can be solved through the adoption of two methods. Firstly, the data set is divided into blocks according to their occurring item frequency, and then the association rules are extracted in each block with different minsupp Secondly, the related rare items are grouped into one abstract item; therefore this abstract item becomes a frequent one. It would not be possible for the first method to extract the association rules among these blocks, and the second method is suffering from extracting rules that involve Diversification of Fuzzy Association Rules to Improve Prediction Accuracy Bilal I.

   individual rare items and frequent items. To overcome the dilemma of rare item problem, Liu et al ed an algorithm called MSapriroi using Multiple Item Support MIS\owever, the number of generated rules depends on the control parameters used. For instance, if the parameter values are set low, then they tend to extract a large number of rules, most of which are not useful. Otherwise, a small number of rules are generated that do not adequately cover the data It is believed that such an approach is applied for extracting the FARs in order to store it in the knowledge Base \(KB\ and use it in the prediction of future values. This can be accomplished and achieved through FARs assessments, while considering the diversity within the FARs. The prediction system can therefore accept any input data to predict the output of future values. The best FARs, in some cases, do not always lead to good results; therefore, the diversified FARs can offer better results In this paper, an approach called Diverse Fuzzy Rule Base DFRB\s proposed which aims to extract a robust and diverse fuzzy rule base that enables the prediction of future values effectively. These fuzzy rules base are generated from FARs, and should be sustained and proved. The proposed approach facilitates the trade-off between both the prediction accuracy and the diversity within FARs This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the related works. Section III describes the proposed approach Section IV reports the experimental results and evaluates the performance study. Finally, section V draws the conclusions II  RELATED WORKS  Mining association rules is a vital task in data mining research. Several algorithms and approaches are proposed for generating association rules which have support and confidence values higher than user-specified thresholds  ilarl y  th ere are s ev eral techn i qu e s th at ca n be conducted to prune the huge number of such association rules and transform them into more representative ones [9  a [9] in trodu ced an approach to obtain representative rules from a large set of association rules using cover operator; these rules are based on satisfying the minsupp and minconf measures. The use of such measures to generate these rules could be affected at the representative rules level. The representative rules implicates small numbers of rules, which decrease the accuracy when they are evaluated and validated. Many techniques were offered by scholars suggesting objective measures to evaluat the association rules   L e n ca et al 14 pr opos ed a n  approach for selecting the most interesting rules based on improvement of the objective measurements. Their approach used a Multi-Criteria Decision Aid \(MCDA\ method to sustain these rules for a non-expert user in a specific domain A clustering technique, for association rules, was developed by Dechang and Xiaolin e d on t h e similarity of the antecedent part of the rules. The rules and its similarity coefficient are stored in the fuzzy simulation matrix to be understood by the user and then evaluated However, the use of the Apriori algorithm for extracting these rules and the similarity of the antecedent parts only affects the result performance Various approaches have been developed in order to extract FARs from quantitative data sets. These rules are presented in the form of \223IF-Then\224 statements using statistical significant methods as minsupp and minconf Huang et al  opos ed a f u zz y dat a  m i ni n g approach t o di s c ov er ru l e s by applying the Apriori algorithm while adapting the discovered rules for the training Adaptive Network based on Fuzzy Inference System \(ANFIS\he approach is applied in the human resources department for predicting future employee performance, in either suitable projects or positions. This approach [6 w a s tested f o r a s m a ll d a ta set with some noise. It uses human expertise/experience \(knowhow\ to define the membership functions. It could be adapted for a small data set, but it is not feasible for large data sets. An approach was implemented by Lu et al which compared two methods for the prediction of one output value, this was applied to Abalone data set taken from the University of California, Irvine \(UCI\ Machine Learning Repository. In the first method, FCM and Apriori algorithms were used to extract FARs and then a Genetic Algorithm \(GA\ was applied for tuning the fuzzy sets. The second method proceeded as the first, but it used variable thresholds in the prediction The prediction accuracy in the first approach was 72.16% for training and 70.56% for testing data; while the second approach obtained 72.55% for training and 71.06% for testing data Associative classification concept has also been widely investigated. Pach et al ed a f u zz y a s s o ci at i v e classification technique. This technique considers both rules the interpretability and classification accuracy, but it used the Apriori approach for extracting frequent items Most of the above mentioned approaches suffer from one or more of the following problems 200  The single minsupp approach is not fair when using a single minsupp for the whole data. Single minsupp  assumes the same frequency for all items in the data. In this manner, the real application data possesses some items with a high frequency; while others possess a low frequency. Therefore, by using a single minsupp some of the significant association rules could be missed 200  The use of such an objective measure to only assess the rules is not effective. It depends on selecting and tuning a parameter threshold to extract the best rules 200  Association rule mining techniques produce many association rules that will affect the prediction results 200  Extraction of representative rules may assist in understanding the perspective points of the user. Yet, it is not dependable and coverable in case of prediction accuracy III  THE PROPOSED D IVERSE F UZZY R ULE B ASE APPROACH  The proposed Diverse Fuzzy Rule Base \(DFRB\h considers both the trade-off between the prediction accuracy and the diversity of FARs to provide robustness in the fuzzy rules base.

On the other hand Table V shows the sensitivity of MAPE adapting minCorr over different numbers of FARs and the diverse FARs where  in both tables. The results shown in Tables IV and V clearly demonstrate that MAPE is not affected when the diverse FARs are added.

In addition, when the value of is between 0.3 and 0.6 then several numbers of diverse FARs are generated which slightly affect the MAPE.

In each methodology, the MAPE is calculated, which is the result of the sensitivity improvement of future value predictions by minimizing the MAPE using the proposed DFRB approach. The result was compared with reported work, and it achieved a better result for the DFRB than the results in   n o t e d th at th e resu lt i n 5 w a s  generated by two approaches. The first approach applied FCM and Apriori algorithms, its MAPE was equal to 29.4 its equivalent MAE was 3.77\hile the value of MAPE using the proposed DFRB is equal to 25.5% \(its equivalent MAE was 2.78\The second approach applied FCM and Apriori algorithms, and then a Genetic Algorithm \(GA\ was employed in order to optimize and minimize the MAE.

However, the results are still better than the previous work, shown in Table IX V  C ONCLUSION  This paper proposed the Diverse Fuzzy Rule Base approach which focused on the Fuzzy Association Rules extraction and effective selection to predict the future values The approach concerns both the best and diverse FARs through its capability in filtering them in order to extract the best FARs, thus reflecting an increase in the prediction 


   accuracy. It generates the FARs, and then calculates the correlation coefficient value for each FAR. After that, it clusters the FARs to determine its diversity while selecting the best FARs \(with a higher correlation value\d diverse FARs for prediction using FIS. The proposed approach expresses and maintains the trade-off between both the prediction accuracy and the FARs diversity. The approach was employed for two case studies: real data set concerning the road traffic domain, and the Abalone data set. It is noted that the proposed DFRB approach offers higher prediction accuracy as compared to other approaches reported in the literature. In the future, the associative classification techniques will be investigated to explore further levels of accuracy  R EFERENCES 1  R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
