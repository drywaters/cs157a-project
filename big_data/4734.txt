We use data mining methods of association rules to do analysis to 1615 valid questionnaires and locate the user groups who are most likely to use Mobile Ticketing, so as to help the Communication Carriers to lock the target customers market precisely and quickly at the beginning of promotional period of Mobile Payment. The results show that mobile payment market, especially mobile ticketing, is still in the early stage, the users are with low awareness, the potential user groups are very big, the users who are willing to use mobile payment services are mostly concentrate in young user groups with high spending monthly and high education Keywords-association rules; mobile payment; mobile ticketing apriority algorithm user groups I  INTRODUCTION Technological innovation has changed people's lifestyles and business models, the popularity of the mobile terminal such as mobile phones, etc.\, and the development of mobile communication technology have brought changes of the payments way, mobile payments has become increasingly popular and an important way to pay in Europe and the United States, Japan and South Korea. Mobile payment is the payment way that In order to purchase tangible or intangible form of product, pay fees or receive se rvices, the payment side uses mobile phone, PDA and other mobile terminals to realize the transfer of funds from payments to the affected party's payment through the mobile communication network [1   In 2008, the global mobile e-commerce revenues reached 554 billion U.S. dollars, accoun ting for 15% of the world's online trading market share, the number of global mobile ecommerce customers r eached 1.67 billion Chinese mobile phone subscribers reached 641 million, had more than 70 million mobile E-commerce users which indicates that mobile payment industry in China have great commercial potential However, the Norson Telecom for ecasts show that the growth rate of mobile payment user is far lower than the growth rate of mobile phone users. What factors influence user perception and use of the mobile payment, comparing the interaction between the customer perceived value customer satisfaction and behavior tend of these consumers judgments by put them into a same research framework w ill undoubtedly be of great significance [2  M a ny st udi es fo cus on this area. The study researched the relationship among the customer perceived value, customer satisfaction and behavioral tendencies in the mobile payment, and found that the perceived value is the antecedent of the customer sa tisfac shown that perceived risk, personal innovation, social impact and perceived usefulness have a direct significant impact on the intention of use. Perceived ease of use and social impact have a direct significant impact on perceived usefulness, no direct impact on the intent of use, only an indirect effect through perceived usefulness. The studies [5 s u ggest ed t h at i n t h e process of mobile payment, consumers have a lot of psychological barriers in the mobile payment, especially the security and credit problems directly blow the desire of consumer, and seriously hamper the rapid development of mobile payment services, and only resolving the question of risk perception, mobile payments can have a greater advantage than the internet. The study t h ro ug h q u e st i onnai r e sur v ey and analysis to mobile payment users thought that social impact have the most significant positive impact on the use willing of mobile payments, and the expected utility, cost and effort expected have not significantly affect on the use willing of mobile payment, facilitating conditions donít have significantly affect on the use behavior, the risk perception has a significant positive impact on the use will of mobile payment and the use willing of mobile payment hast a significant positive impact on the use behavior. The literature [8 s ing  th e  integration technology accepta nce model, analyzed the consumers willing of using mobile payment in six aspects about perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, trust, beliefs and assessment and use attitude, had a certain effect to enhance consumer use willing. The above study did not mention the characteristics of mobile payment user group and potential user groups. It is difficult to determine the target customers market in early deve lopment stages in the mobile payment market This article starts from the development of mobile payment to pay attention to the user groups and the potential user groups of mobile ticket buying lottery tickets and movie tickets and other using mobile phone, uses association rules to data This paper is sponsored by the Innovative Group Program of National N atural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No. 70921001

mining, analyzes the characteris tics of mobile payment users understands the user perception of mobile payment, demand degree as well as the impact of factors of the mobile payment use of users, so as to provide the basis for  promoting the mobile payment and the determination of the target market mobile payment users II  ASSOCIATION  RULES  OF  DATA  MINING  AND  ALGORITHM A  Principles of Mining Association Rules Association Rules Mining is proposed to describe the rules of a potential relationship among data items in the database by R. Agrawal in 1993 [9  whi c h i s a research di rect i on o f  dat a  mining \(DM\ [10-11  Ass o ci ati on R u l e s M i ni ng can di rect l y  express the relationship among item sets \(all values of variables\data. This relationship is not based on a particular distribution of data according to mu ltiple iterations in a specific model, but build on the apparently probability of items in the data information set. Therefore this method is different from the traditional statistical methods; its advantage lies in the clear results and easily explained. In practice, association rules is a process extracting implicit in the work, people unknown before, but potentially useful information and knowledge from a large number , not complete, noisy, vague and random practical application data[12 Whi l e t h e vari abl e t y pes are complicated, the distributions of variables are uncertain and difficult to convert, or all vari ables are independence, can not meet the requirements of traditional statistical methods through association rule mining, we can get the information implicit in the variable value Set I = {i1, i2, Ö, im} is the set of all items, D is the transaction database, transaction T is a subset of items 9 T 002 I 9 Each transaction has a unique transaction identifier as TID Suppose A is a collection composed by items, called item-set Transaction T contains the item-set A, if and only A 002 T. If the item-set A contains k items, claimed it as k item-sets. The percentage of the times of Item-set A appearing in the transaction database D hold the total transaction in D is called the support degree of item-set. If the support degree of the item-set exceeds the minimum support threshold value given by the user, then the item-set is called frequent item-set \(or large item-set Association rule is the logical implicate style in the form of X 000 Y, in which X 003 I 9 Y 003 I, and X 004 Y 005 If the transaction database D, there is s% of the transaction including X 006 Y, then claims that the support de gree of association rules X 000 Y is s in fact, the support degree is a probability value. If the support degree for item-set X is denoted by support \(X\he trust degree of rules is the support \(X 006 Y\ / support \(X\. This is a conditional probability P \(Y | X\Namely: support \(X 000 Y\ =P X 006 Y\dence \(X 000 Y\=P \(Y | X meeting the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold are called strong rules, namely association rules. These two thre shold values are from 0% to 100 Lift is a comparison of two possibilities: one is the possibility of buying the right merchandise in known case of already having purchased goods on the left, and the other one is the possibility of buying the right product under any circumstances In this article, refers to the ratio of the success rate of marketing characteristics group and all group to buy movie tickets / lottery business, when choice target customers group the key is to see the gain value, the gain value is greater that the possibility of using this business is greater. The standard is the same as the selection criteria of other models of data mining by comparison with the "original" rules of, to measure the predictive accuracy extent of the rules to improve B  The Basic Algorithm of Association Rules The Apriority algorithm Based on the theory of frequent item sets is for association rules of the most classical algorithms [15 whi c h i s  a appr oach bas e d o n t h e i d ea of the two-stage frequent set 9 the design of association rule mining algorithm is decomposed into two sub-problems: 1\o find all item-sets which support degree is greater than the minimum supports degree, called frequent item-sets; 2\o find the desired rules brought by the frequent item-sets found in the first step. The generation of candidate item-sets is the core of the Apriori algorithm which is for one-dimensional, singlelayer, Boolean association rule mining It is based on the following properties \(Apriority properties\ item-set is frequent item-set, then all its subsets are frequent item set. Conversely, if a subset of an item set is not frequent item set, then the item set is not frequent item set. The first step of algorithm is to identify all frequent item-sets; step two is to generate the strong association rules by frequent item-sets. First is to generate the frequent first-order item-set L1, then generate the two-order frequent item-set L2 until there is an r value of maki ng Lr is empty, the algorithm stops. Here in the k times cycle the process first created the set of candidate k-item-set , Ck each item-set in the Ck is generated by doing \(k-2\nnections to two frequent item-set belong to Lk-1 which only have one different item. the itemsets in the Ck is used to generate the candidate set of frequent sets, the final frequent item set Lk must be a subset of Ck, each element in the Ck require to be verified in the transaction database to determine whether to join in Lk III  ASSOCIATION  RULES  ANALYSIS  OF  MOBILE  PAYMENT A  Data Processing In March 2009, the current six areas of China Mobile payment \(bus swipe, mobile ticketing, mobile phone on-site payment, mobile phone online shopping, and mobile phone to pay charge, mobile phone to pay public utility tariffs investigated from the user knowledge, user requirements, the situation of use, post-evaluation and future use willing and other aspects. The questionnaire is divided into four parts totally: the preamble, mainly aimed to illustrate the nature and the destination of the survey to the respondents, and to introduce the concept of mobile payment and mobile ticketing Identify applicable sponsor/s here Sponsors

To be shown in Fig.1, the statistics of cognition situation of mobile phones to buy movie ticket / lottery. According to the statistics of the cognition situation in Fig. 1, we can see: users very familiar with mobile tickets take up small proportion, about 30% of users understand, most users only heard but do not know the specific features and usage, and even never heard This shows that mobile phone ticketing business is under low cognition. Therefore, before the promotion of mobile ticketing in mobile payment, we should op en up more channels, increase investment, increase propaganda efforts, and enhance the userís perception According to question of the survey questionnaire, "Which way do you prefer to learn the mobile ticketing of mobile company," we can see from Fig. 2 In the statistical analysis of user answers, selecting " Introduction messages sent by the mobile company's 10086 " and "the publicity / advertising of mobile company's Web site "accounted for the most, followed by" brochures and advertisements of mobile corporate entity operating room or agent "and dialing 10086 to understand, we can see that electronic channels is the favorite of customers of all ages. Therefore, in the publicity of mobile payment business, we should take consumerís cognitive preferences mentioned above into account, publicize is by the ways which consumers like Do you know the mobile phone to buy movie ticket lottery 000\027\000\010 000\025\000\034\000\010 000\026\000\032\000\010 000\026\000\023\000\010 0009\000H\000U\000\\\000\003\000I\000D\000P\000L\000O\000L\000D\000U 000I\000D\000P\000L\000O\000L\000D\000U 000+\000H\000D\000U\000G\000\003\000E\000H\000I\000R\000U\000H\000\017\000\003\000E\000X\000W\000\003\000L\000W 000Z\000D\000V\000\003\000X\000Q\000F\000O\000H\000D\000U 000+\000D\000G\000\003\000Q\000H\000Y\000H\000U\000\003\000K\000H\000D\000U\000G\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000L\000W  Figure 1  Statistics of cognition situation of mobile phones to buy movie tickets / lottery C  Demand Analysis about Using Mobile Phone to Buy Movie Tickets or Lottery According to the survey data can be: that the user needs and a great need for 42% and 32% of users do not need to think it may be necessary in the future there is no need / want to use the business accounts for only 6% of users, its detailed distribution of the situation shown in Fig.3. According to the statistics of the questionnaire, we analyzed the mobile ticketing with association rules, where setting min-sup=10% \(minimum support\, min-con = 10% \(minimum confidence\in-lif 1\(minimum lift\he association rules meeting the minimum support, the minimum confidence and the minimum lift are obtained, as shown in Tab III

We can see from the above Features: Age, monthly expenditure and Education are the main identifying factors of this type customer. Up to 82 expenditures from 1001 to 2000 Yuan per-month and collegeeducated employee will use mobile ticketing. This type user will become the Potential users about mobile ticketing IV  CONCLUSION To find the Specific user groups quickly when marketing in the mobile payment, this article investigated and analyzed Mobile Ticketing field of mobile payment service from the user's awareness, demand, usage, evaluation after use willingness of using and so on by using data mining methods of association rules, and also located user groups who most likely to use Mobile Ticketing. It can help the Communication carriers to Market Precisely by quickly locking the market of the target customers at beginning of Mobile Payment Promotion The results showed that: mobile ticketing market is still in its early stage; the userís awar eness is low and potential user groups are large; Already the user used or the user wishes to use mostly concentrated in th e higher spending and higher educated group of young users. Thus, at the initial stage of Mobile Payment Promotion, the Communication carriers should take into account comprehensively the user's group feature, Simplicity of operation, convenience of Opening and safety of use about mobile ticketing and so on. The Communication carriers should develop a user's perception, let them feel the convenience and practicality and seize the potential users of low awareness by widely publicizing Mobile payment market involves bus swipe, mobile ticketing, mobile phone on-site payment, mobile phone online shopping, and mobile phone to pay charge, mobile phone to pay public utility tariffs and so on. This article only explanatorily study on the user groupsí features of mobile ticketing.

For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is çProblem solvingé. Second in the ranking for students is çElementary computing skillsé. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageé and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with çPersonal skillsé rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by çProfessional skillsé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çInternationalisationé and Entrepreneurshipé. The smallest mean çInternationalisation is just over midway between çweaké and çconsiderableé. Given the European Unionês desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that çProfessional skillsé are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by çPersonal sk illsé and Interpersonal skillsé. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
