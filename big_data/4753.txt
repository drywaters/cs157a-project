Fig 1 The visualization of a single association rule as it is used in this paper The outer ring encodes the values of the antecedent attributes whereas the interior represents the class value and the con\002dence of the rule also used pie charts to denote the con\002dence as we will see later The antecedent of the rule is shown in the border of the circle For every possible attribute i e for every attribute except the class attribute a unique fragment is reserved The fragments are equally sized and are ordered clockwise starting at the right Every fragment is 002lled according the following policy If the respective attribute is referenced in the antecedent the corresponding fragment is 002lled with a color that uniquely represents the value of the attribute's domain This way of representation of course is only feasible if the number of attributes and the size of their domains is small Otherwise we simply omit the other antecedent ring Now that we have an icon for a single rule we need to arrange them in a chart We propose to assign as coordinates the value of association rule evaluation measures More speci\002c we recommend the lift value of a rule as its ycoordinate and the recall as its x-coordinate the con\002dence as a third interesting measure is represented by the de inner color and the support is represented by the circle area Doing so we are able to encode four numeric dimensions into a two-dimensional image without redundancy Of course every other selection of four measures is possible however we found the above measures intuitive and will use them in every 002gure of this work III A UTOMOBILE M ANUFACTURING AND D EVELOPMENT A Fault Detection A major cooperation with an automobile manufacturer led to the investigation of a vehicle database containing approximately 300 000 cases that exhibited 180 attributes The manufacturer kept record of the con\002guration of every car that left the production plant Whenever a failure occurred the database was updated Every tuple in the dataset represents a unique car that left the production plant of the manufacturer Since for every car the time of a failure was logged as well we were able to partition the full set of cars into data sets of in this case equal length We used a preprocessing technique based on Bayesian netw orks 12 to induce a set of attributes that should serve as antecedent attributes of the rules to be visualized It was possible to identify a small set of meaningful attributes out of the 180 that were used to generate rules whose temporal trajectories were visualized Figure 2 shows a set of 760 rules at three different times There are numerous rules that were interesting to experts We selected four rules two showing an evolving problem and two representing a vanishing group of failed cars To simplify the assessment we superposed the rule locations of the second and third chart with the 002rst and indicated the motion with arrows Four rules that showed an interesting behavior and could be assigned a meaning by experts are numbered in the 002gure rule 1 and 2 represent shrinking sets of cars whose con\002dence is also dropping More interesting however is the rapidly lessening lift which gave rise to the conjecture that the cause for the failure had been successfully addressed Contrary rules 3 and 4 represent sets of cars with increasing failure rate con\002dence is increasing indicated by the darkening of the interior of the icons B Safety Systems Every millisecond todays cars must decide based on dozens of signals whether and if so which components of the restraint systems shall be deployed or not The airbag e g shall only deploy in severe crash situations so-called 002re crashes  Unfortunately in the 002rst moments of a crash the signals during a no-\002re crash are very similar to those obtained by a 002re crash Matters are complicated further by the crash test costs that usually come up to a car's price In addition dissimilar vehicles behave different in a standardized crash test The decision logic developed by automobile suppliers must therefore be accurately aligned to every car platform Decision rules e g based on fuzzy logic are formulated by domain experts doing tedious detail work to meet most requirements of a car manufacturer and technical inspectors The rule base to be generated must be both highly interpretable and very accurate regarding crash discrimination to learn such decision logic is still open Many attempts to automatically induce fuzzy rules from observations see e g 5 17 fail since they generate either way too many rules composed of many clauses or too simple rules leading to a high errorproneness We try to 002nd an algorithm which is capable to induce a decision logic that is accurate and interpretable The problem to maintain high accuracy has been already solved using statistical learning methods e g SVMs 9 10 Ef forts so far to induce interpretable and accurate fuzzy rules from SVMs failed Note that each algorithm must deal with the preference structure of this binary classi\002cation problem That is at each point in time which is labeled negatively i e no-\002re must be predicted correctly Every false positive may lead to severe injuries On the contrary it is enough to classify one positive instance before a certain time has past Recognizing a 002re crash after this point in time could be fatal Each signal can be seen as criterion i e an attribute with preference-order domain Clearly the higher one of the signals the more likely it is to 002re at that point in time So both decision classes i e 002re and no-\002re are preference-ordered as well We conclude 4 


Fig 2 Real-w orld application of a set of vehicles with a binary class variable failure and no failure Only rules indicating a failure are depicted Two attributes were used to form the rules hence there are two 002lled regions in the outer ring of every rule The three charts shows the rules at the beginning the middle and the end of the production period To assess the motion of the rules we superposed the 002nal locations of the rules with the 002rst image and indicated the corresponding rule with an arrow Bold arrows indicate the four rules that were found interesting by experts Fig 3 Fuzzy partitioning of attributes First the crisp rule thresholds 265 i;j are clustered with k means and k  6  Then the cluster centroids are used as intersecting points of neighboring fuzzy sets The arbitrary widths w i;j of the overlapping fuzzy sets are found by an EA that the task to solve is an ordinal classi\002cation problem with monotonicity constraints Due to that we apply the Variable Consistency Dominance-based Rough Set Approach VC-DRSA It enables us to directly incorporate the abo v e mentioned preference structures Its key idea is to approximate the given data table by dominance relations These relations induce decision rules of the preferential information in the data Here all rules predicting the 002re class shall be certain i e they must not cover any negative instance Certain rules can be written as R i  if x 1 270 265 i 1 and    and x p 270 265 i;p then class  1  We use the algorithm VC-DomLEM to induce crisp rules of that kind Note that the obtained rule base only covers positive examples The negative class is predicted when no positive rule 002res Every rule is fuzzi\002ed by a fuzzy partitioning of all attributes in order to further compress the rule base The partitioning of every attribute x j with 1 267 j 267 p is performed by several heuristic steps First the clause thresholds 265 ij of all rules R i with 1 267 i 267 r are collected Second an arbitrary number of splits k j is determined e g by the user Note that x j is partitioned into k j  1 fuzzy sets Here suppose that k j  k  6 for all j 2 f 1      p g  Then we group all elements of f 265 ij j 1 267 i 267 r g  e g using k means clustering Finally the cluster centroids c 1 j      c k;j represent the intersecting points of neighboring trapezoidal fuzzy sets 271 i;j  271 i 1 j such that 271 i;j  c i;j   271 i 1 j  c i;j   0  5  The complete process of fuzzi\002cation is shown exemplarily for x 1 in Figure 3 The only parameters left for tuning are the intersecting widths w i;j of the overlapping trapezoidal fuzzy sets We simply apply a steady-state evolutionary algorithm to 002nd good assignments of every width Each candidate solution is represented by a vector of reals i e all w i;j s The following procedure is called for evaluating the 002tness of a candidate solution First we partition the attributes according to the 002xed centroids and the variable widths Second we fuzzify every rule's clause using the fuzzy partition Finally the 002tness is 5 


given by the speci\002city of the fuzzy rule-based classi\002er That is the ratio of true negatives divided by the sum of true and false negatives We 002nally obtained a minimal set of certain rules that in average only use 25 of all possible attributes as fuzzy clauses Whereas the speci\002city of the crisp classi\002er is nearly perfect the one of the fuzzy classi\002er is signi\002cantly lower as expected The discretization of all attributes however increases the readability of the rules Further improvements can be made using e g multiobjective optimization We plan to incorporate temporal dependencies of the data points into the VC-DRSA We expect temporal rules of a more general form to further exploit the problem description The integration of time series data mining techniques e g motif discovery might additionally boost the performance IV F INANCIAL A PPLICATIONS The ongoing 002nancial crisis has revealed how sensitive and almost unpredictable a system the 002nancial market is Subtle changes in customer behavior or credit loss rates may be indicators that lead to premonitions upon which one may react in order to narrow down monetary failures or losses An international capital company raised a project in which we were to reassess credit contracts from a past trading year For every credit contract that was still to be repayed the company used an in-house business intelligence system in connection with human experts to infer the likelihood of the contract to default While this predictive system is highly con\002dential we were asked to assess the temporal development of consecutive creditworthiness assessments Technically speaking we employed a decision tree induction algorithm to arrive at an intuitive starting position Since every path of a decision tree can be considered an association rule we ended up with a rule set for visualization Since the target variable of the decision tree was chosen to be the boolean failure indicator variable we arrived at association rules with consequents referring to exactly that variable of interest Figure 4 shows one of the results For the sake of brevity we only show the 002rst and last time step which are one 002scal year apart The con\002dence was encoded as a pie chart instead of a shaded interior as this was considered more intuitive by the customer The two arrows in Figure 4 point out three rules that showed a rather rapid increase in both lift and con\002dence and the respective antecedent attributes were found worth a further investigation e g to use them as predictive features in a future assessment V O NLINE C OMMUNITY A NALYSIS This application stems from a cooperation with a company creating content for the 3D online community SecondLife 1 In order to evaluate whether online content such as buildings mimicking online stores or museums function as intended a set of virtual sensors is deployed in that environment 1 http://www.secondlife.com Fig 4 Rules re garding credit failure rate at the beginning and the end of one 002scal year The two arrows mark three rules that showed a strong lift and con\002dence increase The respective contracts underwent a deeper investigation Whenever a user passes by such a sensor within a prespeci\002ed vicinity a visit event is logged We analyzed such a log 002le for 100 sensors that had been logged for six months The dataset was then discretized month-wise A common representation of such a log\002le is a so-called cooccurrence graph The nodes comprise the sensors whereas the edges represent that the sensors connected by that edge have been visited by some set of common users within a certain timespan Edge weights are used to denote the cardinality of such sets The cooccurrence graph of the dataset discussed so far is depicted in Figure 5 Even though we have proposed methods to deal with temporal changes within series of cooccurrence graphs 15 we can extract more information when we induce rules from these graphs and apply our visualization This is advantageous because of the following reasons A rule of the form 223If sensor X was visited sensor Y was also visited in p  of all cases\224 is more meaningful than just an edge with an associated weight which corresponds to the absolute support The above rule depicted with our visualization immediately tells how 6 


Fig 5 Cooccurrence graph representing six months of visiting events of 100 sensors deployed on certain islands in SecondLife many visitors compared to other rules are covered and how that number compares to the general visiting activity of a sensor Further a certain rule set will have a 002xed visual representation whereas the corresponding graph needs to be layouted which can create different impressions based on the layout algorithms However coordinates from any graph representation cannot carry the information of the rule icons Figure 6 shows the rules induced from the visiting events of the above-mentioned log 002le at three different time steps Rules have been induced that covered at least 1 of all visits and had a minimum con\002dence of 1 Note that this low con\002dence value is not unusual as we can expect a meaningful lift value since this is the ratio between con\002dence and consequent probability Note also that since a rule represents an edge the antecedent contains exactly one attribute Hence we have omitted the border of the rule icons We focus our 002ndings on two subsets of rules The subset marked by the ellipse in Figure 6 corresponds to a triangle in the original graph 2 All rules show a lift increase to the middle of the time period after which it decreased again Semantically this corresponds to an uprise and loss of predictability of the sensors in that subset a high lift tells that given a visit at one sensor we can conclude a more likely visit at the sensor described by the rule consequent Of course not necessarily by the same user An inquiry at the company con\002rmed that a certain modi\002cation had been undertaken at the 3D content in the vicinity of these sensors during the middle of the 2 As the graph is undirected it is possible that two rules are induced for a single edge if they match the speci\002ed criteria Hence a triangle might be represented by up to six different rules Fig 6 Rules induced from the cooccurrence graph in Figure 5 at three different time steps The two rule sets that are marked by the ellipse and rectangle were identi\002ed to correspond to modi\002ed artifacts inside the 3D world The rule set marked by the ellipse showed a collective lift increase towards the middle of the logging period and diminished after The rules marked by the rectangle exhibit a lift decrease and support increase log period The rules marked by the rectangle in Figure 6 correspond to a single edge that was heavily visited as can be seen from the rule icon size The lift is decreasing which is not surprising in the underlying 3D setting The two sensors were placed along a frequented pathway that more and more users were accepting to use If the general usage increases and thus the consequent probability the lift will decrease as we observe here 7 


VI C O NCLUSION Data collection is a process in time Hence it is almost always possible to attach to a database entry a time stamp We have shown that real-world applications can greatly bene\002t when the time dimension is taken into account This article has demonstrated how complex data analysis tasks can be greatly simpli\002ed by appropriate visualization and temporal change mining methods We therefore encourage to focus research onto the augmentation of other soft computing techniques in this respect R EFERENCES  Rak esh Agra w al T omasz Imielinski and Arun N Sw ami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases In Peter Buneman and Sushil Jajodia editors Proc ACM SIGMOD Int Conf on Management of Data Washington D.C May 26-28 1993  pages 207\226216 ACM Press 1993  Jerzy B\007aszczy 264 nski Roman S\007owi 264 nski and Marcin Szel bag Sequential covering rule induction algorithm for variable consistency rough set approaches Submitted to Information Sciences in 2009  Christian Bor gelt Matthias Steinbrecher  and Rudolf Kruse Graphical Models 227 Representations for Learning Reasoning and Data Mining  John Wiley  Sons United Kingdom 2nd edition 2009  Salv atore Greco Benedetto Matarazzo Roman S\007o wi 264 nski and Jerzy Stefanowski Variable consistency model of Dominance-Based rough sets approach In Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing  pages 170\226181 2001  Hisao Ishib uchi T omoharu Nakashima and T adahik o Murata Threeobjective genetics-based machine learning for linguistic rule extraction Information Sciences  136\(1-4 2001  Christian Moe wes Application of support v ector machines to discriminate vehicle crash events Master's thesis School of Computer Science University of Magdeburg Universit\344tsplatz 2 39106 Magdeburg Germany October 2007  Christian Moe wes and Rudolf Kruse Uni\002cation of fuzzy SVMs and rule extraction methods through imprecise domain knowledge In Jos\351 Luis Verdegay Luis Magdalena and Manuel Ojeda-Aciego editors Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems IPMU08  pages 1527\2261534 University of M\341laga June 2008  Christian Moe wes and Rudolf Kruse Zuordnen v on linguistischen Ausdr\374cken zu Motiven in Zeitreihen at-Automatisierungstechnik  57\(3 March 2009  Christian Moe wes Clemens Otte and Rudolf Kruse T ackling multipleinstance problems in safety-related domains by quasilinear SVM In Didier Dubois M Asunci\363n Lubiano Henri Prade Mar\355a 301ngeles Gil Przemyslaw Grzegorzewski and Olgierd Hryniewicz editors Soft Methods for Handling Variability and Imprecision  volume 48 of Advances in Soft Computing  pages 409\226416 Springer Berlin/Heidelberg October 2008  Christian Moe wes Clemens Otte and Rudolf Kruse Simple machine learning approaches to safety-related systems In Rajat Kumar De Deba Prasad Mandal and Ashish Ghosh editors Machine Interpretation of Patterns Image Analysis and Data Mining  volume 11 of Statistical Science and Interdisciplinary Research  chapter 12 pages 231\226249 World Scienti\002c Publishing Co Inc Hackensack NJ USA June 2010  Detlef Nauck and Rudolf Kruse A neuro-fuzzy method to learn fuzzy classi\002cation rules from data Fuzzy Sets and Systems  89\(3 1997  Judea Pearl Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems Networks of Plausible Inference  Morgan Kaufmann San Mateo California 1988  Matthias Steinbrecher and Rudolf Kruse Identifying temporal trajectories of association rules with fuzzy descriptions In Proc Conf North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society NAFIPS 2008  pages 1\2266 New York USA May 2008  Matthias Steinbrecher and Rudolf Kruse Assessing the strength of structural changes in cooccurrence graphs In B\344rbel Mertsching Marcus Hund and Zaheer Aziz editors KI 2009 Advances in Arti\002cial Intelligence 32nd Annual German Conference on AI Paderborn Germany  volume 5803 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science Lecture Notes in Arti\002cial Intelligence  pages 476\226483 Springer Verlag 2009  Matthias Steinbrecher and Rudolf Kruse Fuzzy descriptions to identify temporal substructure changes of cooccurrence graphs In Proceedings of 2009 IFSA/EUSFLAT  pages 1177\2261182 July 2009  Matthias Steinbrecher and Rudolf Kruse V isualizing and fuzzy 002ltering for discovering temporal trajectories of association rules Journal of Computer and System Sciences  76\(1 February 2010  Jeen-Shing W ang and C.S.G Lee Self-adapti v e neuro-fuzzy inference systems for classi\002cation applications IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems  10\(6 December 2002  Matthe w O W ard Handbook of Data Visualization  chapter Multivariate Data Glyphs Principles and Practice pages 179\226198 Springer Handbooks Comp Statistics Springer Berlin/Heidelberg 2008  Y  Y  Y ao and Ning Zhong An Analysis of Quantitati v e Measures Associated with Rules In Methodologies for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Springer-Verlag Berlin 1999 8 


Capacity for analysis and synthesisé, çResearch skills Capacity to learn 4   Interpersonal skills Leadershipé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çAbility to communicate with non-expertsé, çOral and written communications in native languageé, çCritical and self-critical capabilityé, çTeamworking 5   Personal skills Ability to work autonomously Problem solvingé, çCapacity to adapt to new situations Knowledge of a second languageé, çConcern for qualityé, çWill to succeedé, çElementary computing skillsé, çCapacity for applying knowledge in practice Decision makingé, çProject design and management Information management skills Table 7 shows the mean importance of each gr oup of competences by stakeholder group for the First Cycle Degree respondents. For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is çProblem solvingé. Second in the ranking for students is çElementary computing skillsé. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageé and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with çPersonal skillsé rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by çProfessional skillsé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çInternationalisationé and Entrepreneurshipé. The smallest mean çInternationalisation is just over midway between çweaké and çconsiderableé. Given the European Unionês desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that çProfessional skillsé are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by çPersonal sk illsé and Interpersonal skillsé. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
