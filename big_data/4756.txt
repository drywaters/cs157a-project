INTRODUCTION    This article presents a novel researched method for investigating the cognitive processes of children. This study designed an activity to observe characteristics of cognitive process. In the activity, children were asked to engage in thinking and using scientific concept to draw as many as possible optical paths between the laser gun and target. There were 95 fifth graders participate in this study. Association rules mining were 1 used as a research method for exploring relationships between different types of optical path in this experiment. The data mining results demonstrated that it consist with Piaget\222s cognitive development theory, showing that concrete operation is the dominant thinking mode for fifth grader. It is concluded that data mining is an appropriate research method for analyzing the cognitive processes when it is cooperated with research techniques in thinking skills, such as creativity or problem-solving norm_lien@hotmail.com Chi-Jui Lien   yllu@tea.ntue.edu.tw Yuan-Chang Wu cognitive process; data mining; cognitive development  454 Association rule mining is a popular and a well developed research method for business management. It is used to discover interesting relations between variables in large databases had  introduced the basic concepts of associated rule mining For example, a customer buys bread; he/she is likely to also buy jam. This information can be used to predict behavior pattern and model of consumers. Though this method was first used in business, the application of this method is getting more popular in other research fields In the educational field, this method have been used to find conceptual map m an d learning port f oli o analysis but s e l do m  u sed  in co gnit iv e process analysis.

In this section, subjects, instrument and data collection, data analyzed were introduced as followings 2.2 Instrument and Data Collection  Analyses of students\220 draws were showed in Table 1 The percentage of each optical path that students have drawn was showed in the last column. From this table, it was interesting to find that students\220 cognitive operations in this experiment were systematic. Two factors were found here: the first, \215forced adapting\216 vs 215planned adapting\216; the second, \215short path\216 vs. \215long path\216 The s6 path was a typical example of \215forced adapting.\216 Student added mirrors only when the beam was about to touch the wall or black brick. This revealed the student put mirror to reflect the beam when he/she was forced. Differently, the s1 showed a typical example of \215planned adapting.\216 Student \215planned\216 the position of mirrors and put mirror, but not \215forced\216 by the wall or brick and no choice to do so. Student who drew s1 was considered to be more \215abstract thinking.\216 And, student drew s6 was considered to be more \215concrete thinking.\216  From Table 1, percentages of more abstract-oriented optical path s1, s3, and s5, \(22, 15 and 20%, respectably were lower than that of other more concrete-oriented optical paths \(s2, s4, and s6; 87, 62, and 86 respectably\s revealed that students in the fifth grade were comparably limited in using abstract-oriented thinking then concrete-oriented thinking. Such result matches with Piaget\220s cognitive development theory [5 The seven optical paths have different length: short s1, s2\, medium \(s3, s4\, long \(s5, s6\ shortest \(s7 As indicated previously, the optical path s1, s3, and s5 were not dominant and the optical path s6 had the effect of \215forced adapting,\216 thus, only s2, s4, and s7 \(87, 62 and 88%\ was compared. Noteworthy, the shortest path s7\ and short path \(s2\more predominant. This revealed that students preferred to develop a shorter path then long one. This paralleled with the cognitive information theory, that human tended to manipulate less information if they could 2.1 Subjects 2.3 Data Analysis There were 95 fifth graders from four intact classes participated in this study. These students were from a school in Tuo-Yuan County, Taiwan. Students in this school were composed of diverse socio-economic statuses and could be regarded as a typical school in Taiwan We designed an experiment to explore the characteristic of cognitive process of human, in this case na\357ve student. The theoretical background of this design was following the research founding in creativity research. Studies in this research area has been identified that the fluency and unique were important to one\220s creativity  T h is study devel o ped a fl uency test  activity to induce students\220 cognitive thinking structure In the experiment, students were invited to actively engage in thinking and using basic scientific concept to draw as many paths as possible of using a laser beam to shoot the target as indicated in Figure 1. An additional requirement to the test was that student needed to use the minimum of mirrors to reach the target. This modification from traditional creativity test allowed students to show his/her fluency, in addition, some unique thinking. This also provided information for us to observe students\220 cognitive operation process  Students\220 drawings were coded and analyzed with association rules mining method  Students were given enough time to make drawing in classes. After the test, students\220 diagrams were collected translated and coded for later analyzing  Fig. 1. Many boards was provided to the students for they to draw as many paths as possible 002\003\003 2. METHODOLOGY 3.

IV PERFORMANCE STUDY In this section, we present a performance comparison of CIU algorithm and FP-growth algorithm The data sets that we used for our experiments are generated randomly. Figure 5 shows the results of test of run time. In our experiments, there are 50K transactions in primitive database. The run time shown in the figure is the incremental run time. Th e figure shows that the incremental run time can be reduced down by about one-half in the CIU algorithm, and the gap grows wider when the number of incremental transactions grows up Figure 5 Run time with incremental transactions V CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have investigated the problem of continuous incremental updati ng in large databases. The contributions of this paper are summarized here: 1\ We have proposed an optimization technique for reducing the database size during the update process. 2\ We have give the definition and algorithm of transaction tree T-tree The order of items in every transaction in T-tree is different from that in FP-tree  3\ We have proposed a continuous incremental algorithm, or CIU algorithm for short. 4 have implemented the CIU algorithm, and studied its performance in comparison with FP-growth algorithm in large databases A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China 70971004 REFERENCES 1 R  A g r a w a l  T   I m ie l i ns ki a n d A   S w am i  M i n i n g A s s o cia tio n Rul e s  between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc.

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
