This algorithm is based on Ñregion patternsî and necessitates some computations, being necessary a pre-processing phase for determining the visual similitude between the image regions of the same category In the pre-processing phase, the region patterns, which appear in the images, are determined. So, each image region Reg ij is compared with other image regions from the same categories. If the region Reg ij matches other region Reg km  having in common the features on n 1 n 2 n c positions then the generated region pattern is SRj \( -, -, n 1 n 2 n c   and the other features are ignored The generation of image region patterns is described in pseudo-code by the following algorithm  Algorithm IV.1   Generation of region patterns for each image Input  set of n images {I 1 I 2 I n laying in the same category; each image I is a set of regions Reg im  Output  set  of region patterns for each image Method  for i 1 1, n-1 do for j 1 1, I i1 nregions do for i 2 i 1 1, n do  for j 2 1, I i2 nregions do if Reg j1 matches Reg j2 in the components n 1 n 2 n c then  i=i+1  RSi 1 RSi 1 n 1 n 2 n c RSi 2 RSi 2 n 1 n 2 n c  end  end end end A database with five images relevant for a category is used. For this category, an example of images representation using region patterns can be observed in the Table I By applying the algorithm IV.1 on the database from Table I, the results from Table II are obtained As it can be observe, the number of region patterns is big, but it is pruned in the phase of rules elimination process, described in the next section The image modelling in terms of itemsets and transaction is the following the transactions represent the set of  region patterns determined by the previous algorithm the itemsets are represented by region patterns of the images laying in the same category the frequent itemsets represent the itemsets with the support greater than the minimum support the itemsets of cardinality between 1 and k are iteratively found the frequent itemsets are used for rule generation The algorithm for rules generation based on region patterns is described in pseudo-code  Algorithm IV.2  The generation of  semantic pattern rules based on region patterns Input the image set represented as I =\(RS 1 RS k  m is a region pattern Output the set of semantic pattern rules Method  Ck: the set of region patterns of k-length Lk: the set of frequent region patterns of k-length PatternRules: the set of pattern rules constructed from frequent itemsets, for k>1 L1= {frequent region patterns for\(k=1; Lk!=null; k Ck+1=candidates generated from the set Lk foreach transaction t in the database do Increment the number of all candidates that appear in t end Lk+1=candidates from Ck+1 that has the support greater or equal than suport_min end PatternRules=PatternRules+{Lk+1->category end T ABLE I  R ELEVANT IMAGES FOR A CERTAIN CATEGORY  ImgID Image Regions 1 R\(a,b,c,d\, R\(aí,bí,cí,d 2 R\(a,b,c,f\, R\(aí,bí, cí,d 3 R\(a,b,c,fíí\R\(aí,bí,cí,i 4 R\(a,b,c,fí\R\(aí,bí,cí,i 5 R\(a,b,e,d\, R\(m,bí,cí,d

In this case two problems exist: the first one is that the set of rules can contain noise information and affect the classification time. Another problem is the big number of rules that can also affect the classification time This is an important problem in the real applications, which necessitate rapid response. On the other side, the elimination of rules can affect the classification accuracy. The elimination methods are the following elimination of  specific rules and keeping the rules with big confidence elimination of rules that can introduce errors in the classification process The following definitions introduce some notions used in this section [11   Definition 1   Given two rules R 1 C and R 2 C, the first rule is called general if R 1  R 2 The second one is called specific Definition 2  Given two rules R 1 and R 2 R 1 is called stronger than R 2 or R 2 is weaker than R 1  1\ R 1 has confidence greater than R 2  2\If the confidences are equal, but the support\(R 1  greater than support\(R 2  3\ the supports are equal, support\(R 1 upport\(R 2  and confidences confidence\(R 1 fidence\(R 2  equal, but R 1 has fewer attributes than R 2   The elimination of weak and specific semantic pattern rules is described in pseudo-code Algorithm IV.3  Elimination of weak and specific rules Input  set of semantic pattern rules, S generated for each category, C   Output  the set of rules which will be used for classification Method Sort the rules for C category in conformity to Definition 1 foreach rule in S do begin Find the most specific rules Eliminate the rules with  smallest confidence end C  Semantic image classification The classifier represents the set of semantic pattern rules used to predict the category of images from the test database. Being given a new image, the classification process searches in the rules set for finding the most appropriate category. Images are processed and are represented by means of semantic indicators as Prolog facts The semantic pattern rules are applied to the set of images facts, using the Prolog inference engine A semantic pattern rule matches an image, if all characteristics which appear in the body of the rule also appear in the image characteristics The algorithm for image categorization is described in pseudo-code

Algorithm IV.4  Semantic classification of an image Input new unclassified image and the set of semantic pattern rules; each pattern rule has the confidence R i conf Output the classified image, and the score of matching Method  S = null foreach rule R in PatternRules do begin if R matches I then Keep R and add R in S I.score = R.conf  Divide S into subsets one foreach category: S 1 S n   foreach subset S k from S do Add the confidences of all rules from S k  Add I image in the category identified by the rules from S k with the greatest confidence I.score = max 000 S k conf end end  end In the experiments realized through this study, two databases are used for testing the learning process. The database used for learning contains 200 images from different nature categories and is used to learn the correlations between images and semantic concepts. All the images from the database have JPEG format and are of different dimensions. The database used in the learning process is categorized into 50 semantic concepts. The system learns each concept by submitting appreciatively 20 images per category. The testing database contains 500 unclassified images The results of the semantic image retrieval after the sunriseî category are observed in the figure 6. These images from the test database are correctly classified by the algorithm The results of the semantic image retrieval after the mountainî category are observed in the figure 7. Two images from the test database are incorrectly classified since they represent ìclouds The performance metrics, precision and average normalized modified retrieval rate \(ANMRR\, are computed to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the semantic pattern rule generation and annotation methods The precision is defined as the ratio between the number of images correctly classified by system, and the total number of classified images. The precision is in the range of 0 an d g r eater v a lu es repres en t a better retriev a l performance. Averaged Normalized Modified Retrieval Rate \(ANMRR\ is an overall performance calculated by averaging the result from each query h e A N M R R is in the range of d s m a ller v a lu e s repres en t a better retrieval performance These parameters are computed as average for each image category as in the table III    Figure 6.

Actually, the results of experiments are very promising, because they show a small average normalized modified retrieval rate and a good precision for the majority of the database categories, making the system more reliable V  CONCLUSION  In this study we propose methods for semantic image annotation based on visual content. For establishing correlations with semantic categories, we experimented and selected some low-level visual characteristics of images. So each category is translated in visual computable characteristics and in terms of objects that have the great probability to appear in an image category  Figure 8. Category vs. percent of images correctly classified   The algorithm that generates the semantic pattern rules selects the image characteristics with the greatest probability of apparition, offering a better generality By comparison to other image annotation methods, our proposed and developed methods have some advantages: the entire process is automated, and a great number of semantic concepts can be defined; these methods can be easily extended to any domain, because the visual features semantic indicators remain unchanged, and the semantic pattern rules are generated based on the set of example labeled images used for learning semantic concepts; the spatial information is taken into account and it offers rich semantic information about the relationships of the image colour regions \(left, right, center, bottom, and upper The proposed methods have the limitation that they canít learn every semantic concept, due to the fact that the segmentation algorithm is not capable to segment images in real objects. Improvements can be brought using a segmentation method with greater semantic accuracy R EFERENCES  1  A  Be r s o n S  J  S m it h, D a ta W a r e ho us i n g  D a ta Mi ni ng a n d O L A P  McGraw-Hill.

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
