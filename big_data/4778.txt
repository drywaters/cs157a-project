paper design a parallel algorithm for mining frequent pattern over big transactional data based on an extended MapReduce Frame In which the mass data 036le is 036rstly split into many data sub\036les the patterns in each sub\036le can be quickly located based on bitmap computation by scanning the data only once And the computing results of all sub\036les are merged for mining the frequent patterns in the whole big data In order to improve the performance of the proposed method the insigni\036cant patterns are pruned by a statistic analysis method when the data sub\036les are processed The experimental results show that the method is ef\036cient strong in scalability and can be used to ef\036ciently mine frequent patterns in big data I I NTRODUCTION The amount of data in our world has

patterns from transactional database But an apriori-like algorithm may suffer from nontri vial costs because it needs repeatedly scan the database and check a huge size of candidates by pattern checking The representative work of the Pattern-Growth algorithm named FP-growth is presented by Han et al 7 F P gro w t h w o rks i n a di vi de-and-conquer way and transforms the problem of 336nding long frequent patterns to searching for shorter ones recursively and then concatenating the suf\336x An FP-growth method can 336nd the frequent patterns without candi date generation by scanning the database only twice However the existing Apriori-like and Pattern-growth algorithms are not suitable to mine a big data for the size of a big data is so big that it is inef\336cient to scan the data multiple time Moreover when processing a big data it requires massively parallel software running on hundreds or even thousands of cheap computers that act as a cluster instead of autonomously algorithm running on one expensive supercomputer So it is necessary to 336nd a paralleled algorithm 14 t hat can be run o n m as s i v e comput ers t o mine the frequent patterns in a big

be tedious to repeatedly scan the database and check a large set of candidates by pattern matching in situations with proli\336c frequent patterns long patterns or quite low minimum support thresholds In order to avoid generating a huge set of candidates Han et al 7 p ropos ed an F P gro w t h met hod t o mi ne transactional transactions w ithout candidate generation An FP-growth method can achieve much better performance than an Apriori method by scanning database only twice At the 336rst time of scanning database all frequent data items are selected and sorted in a frequency descendant order and then an FP-tree can be built to maintain the projections of the transactions that only contain frequent items at the second time of scanning database At last the frequent patterns can be quickly selected from FP-tree by applying an FP-growth algorithm Both Apriori-like methods and FP-growth method can not be directly applied to mine a big transactional data because the following reasons for a Apriori-like method it 336rstly is rather costly to generate numerous candidates and additionally it also is impractical to repeatedly scan the huge data to check whether a pattern is frequent or not And for FP-growth method it also needs to scan the data twice and it is also expensive to perform projection and sort operations on each transaction            1 1 2 randt 003 is in is the tuple set

IDE disks and a gigabit Ethernet link All of the machines were in the same hosting facility and therefore the round-trip time between any pair of machines was less than a millisecond All programs were written in Java and running on Hadoop 0.20.0 frame The synchronous data sets generated by IBM synthetic data generator http://www.almaden.ibm.com using 20k distinction items and 128 millon

described as follow 1 empirically choose two or more patterns whose supports are or near is increasing Additionally as the average transaction length T and average pattern length I increase there contain more patterns in the dataset and more time is needed to process m ore patterns and transfer intermediate computing results But the increasing degree of processing time is limited even though the density of dataset increases greatly Secondly the dataset T10I4D128M was used to study the performance of the proposed method on varying bits and MB pairs and then merged into a output 336le 4 The approximate set of frequent patterns can be obtained by mining the output 336le The function SPatMiner is designed to get the signi\336cant patterns in a data subset by applying bitmap computation and prunes the insigni\336cant ones according to the probability model discussed in Section IV-B As shown in lines 1-6 the set of signi\336cant items in the processed data subset denoted by 


Processing time\(Second As have discussed in Section IV in order to achieve better performance some insigni\336cant patterns will be pruned when processing the data sub\336le As a result some error will be brought into the mining result when mining the frequent patterns in whole data because the information of some insigni\336cant patterns are lost In the experiments we study the correctness of the proposed method by conducting a series experiments on T10I4D128M We 336rst analyze the PDFs of all 278 patterns whose supports are right to be in the dataset then the minimum and maximum of data Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment Comunications of the ACM Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment are more insigni\336cant patterns will be pruned Thus few patterns need to be saved and used to mine the frequent patterns in the whole data when processing a data sub\336le and hence achieve better pe rformance So as shown in Figure 3 the processing time of the method decreases as increase is use to

data According to MapReduce frame the big data is 336rstly split into a lot of data sub\336les and the sub\336les are concurrently processed by a cluster consisting of hundreds or thousands computers In order to improve the performance of proposed method the insigni\336cant patterns in the data sub\336le are ef\336ciently located and pruned by probability analysis The simulation result proves that

insights and techniques of data-mining and visualization on a qualitative research tool that operates at multiple scales from the narrative analysis of a single interview to large datasets of thousands of hours of audio or video recorded interviews This visualization tool has the great potential to enhance the capacity of the researcher to make-sense of these wider patterns and connections Human rights researchers analyze the relevant data of various sorts format e.g textual audio and video and conduct both qualitative and quantitative content analysis With the increasingly available data sets about human rights violation and their growing sizes navigating and analyzing such large scale data collections is more and more challenging Our work presents a concept of proof of combining text mining and information visualization techniques to address this challenge We anticipate the growing importance of such visual analytic tools that help users conveniently navigate to their on-demanded information and manipulate data and that facilitate users to analyze the large scale data collection through multiple views and interactive features There is no similar tool in use within the eld of oral history With our speci“c CKM design we expect that it is applicable to different kinds of time-series sequential data stream A CKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Kim Moore and Eve-Lyne Cayouette Ashby who participated in the rst design presentation meeting as regular users and maintainers of Stories Matter database They provided valuable feedback on our design ideas This project is funded by SSHRC Digging into Data challenge grant R EFERENCES  D bo yd and K Cra wford Six pro v ocations for big data  i n A Decade in Internet Time Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society  2011  D Fisher  R  Deline M Czerwinski and S Druck er  Inter actions with big data analytics vol 19 no 3 pp 50…59 2012  D Rotman Y  He J Preece and A Druin Understanding large scale online environments with qualitative methods in 2013 iConference  2013  T  He y  S T ansle y  and K T olle The Fourth Paradigm DataIntensive Scienti“c Discovery  Microsoft Research 2009  J Heer and S Kandel Interacti v e analysis of big data  vol 19 no 1 pp 50…54 2012  S Kandel A P a epck e J Hellerstein and J Heer  Enterprise data analysis and visualization An interview study vol 18 no 12 pp 2917…2926 2012  S Knudsen M R Jak obsen and K Hornbæk  A n e xploratory study of how abundant display space may support data analysis in the 7th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction Making Sense Through Design  2012  J Li vnat and Y  Zhang Information interpretation or infor mation discovery Which role of analysts do investors value more vol 13 no 3 pp 612…641 2012  A Sri v asta v a and M Sahami Text Mining Classi“cation Clustering and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2009  I H W itten G W  P aynter  E  Frank C Gutwin and C G Nevill-Manning Kea Practical automatic keyphrase extraction in The 4th ACM Conference On Digital Libraries  1999  C Zhang  Automatic k e yw ord e xtraction from documents using conditional random elds vol 4 no 3 pp 1169 1180 2008  Y  nung Chen Y  Huang H yi Lee and L shan Lee Unsupervised two-stage keyword extraction from spoken documents by topic coherence and support vector machine in The 37th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing  2012  H.-L Ong A.-H T an J N Lee H P an and Q.-X Li Foci  Flexible organizer for competitive intelligence in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management  2001  C Jacquemin H F olch and S Nugier  Ocean 2 1/2d interactive visual data mining of text documents in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization  2006  C H K u  J  H  Nguyen and G Lero y  T asc crime report visualization for investigative analysis A case study in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration  2012  W  Cui S Liu L T an C Shi Y  Song Z Gao X T ong and H Qu Text”ow towards better understanding of evolving topics in text vol 17 no 21 2001  H Greenspan On Listening to Holocaust Survivors Recounting and Life History  Westport Praeger 2010  M Frisch Three dimensions and more Oral history be yond the paradoxes of method pp 221…222 2008  S High M Jessica and S Zembrzycki T elling our stories/animating our past A status report on oral history and new media vol 37 no 3 pp 1…22 2012  S High and D Sw orn  After the intervie w The interpreti v e challenges of oral history video indexing vol 1 no 2 2009  K Schaf fer and S Smith Human Rights and Narrated Lives:The Ethics of Recognition  New York and Basingstoke Palgrave Macmillan 2004  E Jessee S Zembrzycki and S High Stories matter Conceptual challenges in the development of oral history database building software vol 12 no 1 2010  L G Shapiro and G C Stockman Computer Vision  Prentice Hall 2001 112

 Fig. 10. Complementarity Analysis forSMTCL and Dalian Guangyang  V. CONCLUSIONS  This paper provides a method based on text mining of patents to help extract technology intelligence to facilitate M&A. We take the NCS industry as an example. NCS is the most important part of numerical machine tools. The paper follows a technology forecasting approach and outlines a technology synergy analysis based on a multi-term Boolean search to distinguish NCS records This study has a few limitations. Some doubt remains regarding the reliability of patent data. Sometimes patent data cannot reflect the core techno logy of a company because some patent-based indicators could be obscured by strategic behavior; that is, sometimes an emerging technology is not yet permitted for patenting. Another limitation is that the latest patent data we studied are2 years old because of the 18-month patent application period. In the meantime, some changes in NCS-related technology may well have occurred Within these limitations, the paper sought to forecast developmental trends for key candidate technologies, and based on the technology trends revealed, look for technology acquisition candidates for a certain company  The technology forecasting results suggest that NCS has become a global research hotspot in the field of machine tools in recent years, and patents have reached increased significance in corporate activity. The analysis of country-topic correlation leads us to conclude that there are two research clusters in the wo rld, one centered in Japan and the USA, the other centered on Germany. While China is geographically far away from th e other countries, it has only a faint relationship with Japan and Taiwan; in this relationship the key words are “control,”“signal” and compatibility,” which are differe nt from other countries and do not represent NCS core technology. In addition publication keywords correlation analysis also indicates that control system is a current research hotspot and focus  We then examine the top patent applicants and top publication institutions. As shown, the top patent applicants are mainly Japanese and German corporations, while top publication institutions mainly come from China and the USA. This divergence is logical since the nature of patents and publications is different in that patents focus on applications whereas literature researches theories and methods At the same time, we find that Japanese corporations are powerful in the NCS machine tool industry. Hence we choose the companies FANUC and MITS UBISHI as study targets Comparing SMTCL with them, based on IPC analysis, we observe that G05B19 is the main weakness—incidentally this is a part of the NCS core technology Looking at SMTCL’s M&A history shows us that M&A did increase their patent portfolio and business income. We also learn that SMTCL is be hind the leading NCS-related companies in patenting, although it’s number 1among machine tool enterprises in the world. To make up for its weaknesses, we search for some technology acquisition candidates for SMTCL. We first download all patents related to the technology where SMTCL is lacking. Then we develop a patent filter to select a list of companies as potential targets We analyze the targets’ respective patent portfolios, filtering out all but 3 companies. Finally, we measure the technology synergy among the 3 companies, and analyze the similarity and complementarity between the targets and SMTCL In conclusion, we have grasped the development trends of some candidate technologies by patent data and find the disadvantages of SMTCL. To compensate for the disadvantages, we look for technology candidates for SMTCL M&A. In this paper, we have measured the knowledge relatedness to judge the matching degree between SMTCL and the candidates using patent data, whereas we haven’t done due diligence to make sure the core researchers still work for the target company.

As the thickest shielding studied in this work is 10 cm, it follows then that the lower energies of the incident trapped proton spectra are most affected Additionally, although the incident trapped proton spectra reach energies of up to approximately 600 MeV, the majority of the spectra are dominated by low energy protons and are thus strongly attenuated by the shielding Essentially, the increased shielding thickness has the effect of hardening the incident proton flux distribution. This result also helps explain the significant localized shielding dependencies observed in the TR model development Comparatively, the GCR spectrum includes heavy ions that reach well above GeV energies. Consequently, GCR ions can undergo spallation and fragmentation with the aluminum shielding resulting in the ejection of large amounts of nucleons and lighter ions. All these secondary particles will have energies lower than the primary incident ions but that are still quite large. In addition to this is the sheer abundance of heavy ions present in the primary and secondary flux distributions. With increasing wall thicknesses, the likelihood of spallation, fragmentation, and other resonance effects increases as well. These processes favor the increase in proton and alpha particle fluxes at low energies with thicker shielding. Above the transition points the various flux distributions decrease with increasing wall thickness suggesting they are populated by a combination of high-energy incident protons and alpha particles that penetrate through the shielding as well as heavy ions that release secondary protons and alpha particles. These fluxes will fall off, however, with the shielding thickness as the likelihood of penetration decreases Overall, when the GCR- and TR-induced distributions are summed together, the neutron component and proton component dominate the flux distribution at low energies At higher energies, the protons represent the dominant contributor to the total dose. Furthermore, at very high energies, alpha particles start to become more dominant than neutrons and their abundance becomes comparable to that of the protons. Table 6 and Table 7 detail the calculated ambient dose equivalent rates, effective dose equivalent rates and E/H  10\ios for trapped protons and GCR ions at solar maximum and minimum conditions, and for the four wall thicknesses As is detailed in Table 6, the simulated TR-induced daily ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates decrease with increasing wall thickness. The simulated values are also smaller at solar maximum conditions relative to solar minimum as expected. Next, it is useful to benchmark the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates against the TEPC dose equivalent measurements collected in 2000 and 2009 to verify the assumption that H TEPC  is approximately H  10\d moreover, to verify that the first order approximation provided by Eq. \(9\ is reasonable. The year 2000 coincides with solar maximum conditions and during this time, the ISS orbited at an altitude of 372 km to 396 km. In contrast, the year 2009 represents solar minimum conditions and the ISS orbited at an altitude of 340 km to 380 km. The measured TEPC daily dose equivalent rates at the location of Service Module Panel 327 SM-327\ged between 0.15 \226 0.2 mSv d 1 in 2000 and 0.2 \226 0.3 mSv d 1 in 2009. Comparatively, for solar maximum conditions, the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates were found to be as low as 0.094 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2  to as high as 0.42 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 hese simulated values are within a factor of two of the measured values Similarly, at solar minimum conditions, the simulated results ranged from 0.14 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 wall thickness\ 0.85 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 wall thickness\hich 


14   are again within the range of measured results, though the thinnest shielding results in a slightly more conservative estimate that is within a factor of 3. It is thus noted that a change in wall thickness does have a significant influence on the TR-induced doses. While it is unclear which of the results best approximates the ISS shielding, it is argued that the upper and lower limits of the shielding thicknesses used provide representative limits of the expected dose The simulated TR-induced effective dose equivalent rate determined by Sato et al 53 a t so l a r  mi ni mu m c o nd i t i o n s   for a wall thickness of 5.56 cm \(15 g cm 2 uminum, was estimated to be 0.144 mSv d 1 In that study, fluence-toeffective dose equivalent conversion factors for all heavy ions were used. To compare, at 10.8 g cm 2 in our study the simulated effective dose equivalent was determined to be 0.187 mSv d 1 For a wall thickness of 16.2 g cm 2 the effective dose equivalent rate was determined to be 0.127 mSv d 1 These simulated values are in good agreement with the values presented by Sato et al  d i n di cat e s t h at  the majority of the effective dose equivalent due to TR exposure is reasonably estimated considering only the neutron, proton, and alpha particle contributions. The simulated ratios of E  H  10\uctuate from 0.41 up to 0.51 for solar maximum conditions and 0.35 to 0.48 for solar minimum conditions. This ratio also appears to fall off with decreasing wall thickness. Overall, the latter results suggest that for TR exposures, the TEPC measured ambient dose equivalent offers a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent Unlike the daily TR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates, the predicted GCR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates increase with increasing wall thickness Table 7\This results due to the increased neutron, proton and alpha particle flux distributions at low energies. As expected, the daily ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose equivalent rates are again smaller at solar maximum conditions as compared to solar minimum conditions. The measured GCR dose equivalent values in 2000 and 2009 are on the order of 300 to 400 \265Sv d 1 and 400 to 500 \265Sv d 1 respectively. In comparison, the simulated values range from 60 \265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 8 265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar maximum conditions and 100 265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 o 206 \265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar minimum conditions. These predicted values underestimate the measured ones by more than a factor of two. This can be attributed to the exclusion of the heavy-ion contributions Moreover, these results also suggest that as an operational quantity, the ambient dose equivalent is not well suited for high-energy heavy ions. This observation has also been previously suggested by Pelliccioni h o i n di cat ed t h a t  a depth greater than 10 mm would be more appropriate for higher-energy radiation and that no single depth is appropriate for all heavy ions Sato et al  o calcu late d th e eff ect iv e dos e equiv ale nt rate from GCR exposures \(including heavy ions\for a wall thickness of 15.0 g cm 2 Al to be 0.21 mSv d 1 At solar minimum conditions, the simulated effective dose equivalent rates in this study are found to be 0.13 mSv d 1  and 0.15 mSv d 1 for wall thicknesses of 10.8 g cm 2 and 16.2 g cm 2 respectively. As was the case earlier, there is again a slight discrepancy regards to those published by Sato et al 53 attrib u t ed to th e ex clu s io n o f th e h e a v y io n s   It was shown by Sato [53 th at th e co n t rib u tio n to t h e cumulative effective dose equivalent from both iron nuclei and pions are each nearly as much as the contribution alpha particles. Despite these underestimations, from the current simulations the ratios of effective-to-ambient dose equivalent are relatively constant between solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Furthermore, unlike TR exposures, the ratios decrease from 1.19 to 0.84 with increasing shielding thickness. These results suggest that the ambient dose equivalent is roughly a 1:1 estimate of the effective dose equivalent for GCR exposures, depending on which wall thickness is assumed. However, it is again noted that the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates are underestimated so these ratios should fall below one These latter conclusions can also be verified in another manner. The total effective dose equivalent estimated by Sato et al 53 in sid e th e ISS at so lar m i n i m u m co n d itio n s   was determined to be 0.37 mSv d 1 The total dose equivalent from TR and GCR exposures measured with the TEPC at SM-327 during solar minimum conditions \(2009 is approximately 0.6 \226 0.8 mSv d 1 The ratio of the effective dose equivalent predicted by Sato to these measured TEPC values results in an effective-to-TEPC dose equivalent conversion factor of E  H TEPC of 0.5 to 0.6. This again shows that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent and can be used as an appropriate surrogate protection quantity. This conclusion is applicable to solar maximum conditions as it was shown in the simulation results that for TR exposures the E  H  10\ios are only slightly higher at solar maximum conditions and essentially remain unchanged for GCR exposures from solar maximum to solar minimum 4.6 \226 Complex Geometry Results The above transport simulations at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2 were repeated using the complex geometry shown in Figure 16. Rather than determining the flux inside the entire SM, the flux distribution within the crew quarter \(SM-CQ was examined only. This area best approximates the location of SM-327. When compared to the simple cylinder simulations, the complex geometry is shown to have no effect on the simulated E  H  10\version ratios but does influence the observed ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates. The simulated values for trapped exposures are largely unchanged while for GCR exposures, the complex geometry results in a factor of two increase due to the build-up effect. Specifically, at a wall thickness of 5.4 g cm 2 the simulated ambient and effective 


15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
