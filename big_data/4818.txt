Keywords-Market basket analysis; Text segmentation Association rule I. INTRODUCTION Market basket analysis is a good way to provide scientific decision support for retail market by mining association relationships among items people purchased together Mining result s m a y no t b e in terest ing to peopl e since they don’t show semantic associations among items However, the consequence may be different if association rules are mined on items’ internal characteristics. In this paper, we propose an innovative market basket analysis method by mining association rules on items’ internal characteristics which are obtained by using automatic words segmentation technology  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the general architecture of the market basket analysis system. Section III describes the proposed method to get association relationships between items themselves by using item characteristic association rules. Section IV demonstrates the effectiveness of the method through three different experiments. Section V concludes the paper II THE MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE Generally, the historical retail database is huge and the 
time complexity of the association rule mining is high Therefore, real-time data mining is unpractical and it is much better to establish the market basket analysis system by applying the Client/Server architecture \(Figure 1\e roles of client and server in the architecture are as follows

which is strongly associated to the received set \(sequence A typical use of this market basket analysis system is that in a restaurant equipped with electronic ordering system consumers can get scientific recommendations after each step of ordering dishes with this system III ASSOCIATION RULE ANALYSIS  After having mined the item characteristic association rules, we introduce methods of how to find a set of items that is strongly associated to a certain set \(sequence items when a client receives a request A On Condition That the Request Format is a Set of Items  Because the request formats \(set or sequence\ received by clients are different, the method used to calculate a set of items which is strongly associated to the request is different as well. While the request format is a set of items, it will be much simple Suppose A is a set of items described as follows 4v  Hongshaoniurougaijiaofan\}, and the item characteristic association rules are  033OA  8 sup = 0.1; conf    S sup= 0.15; conf= 0 The corresponding meaning for the second association rule is: Among all the consumers who ordered dishes with  Niurou 4v Hongshao\60% of them ordered dishes with S Jidan\ell. This is supported by 15% of the whole trading records. The first rule can be rendered similarly Because item Sõ<Ÿ"8 Jidantang\” contains characteristics 8 Tang S Jidan\hich are strongly associated to the characteristics of items in set A we can make a qualitative decision that item Sõ<Ÿ"8 Jidantang\” is strongly associated to the given set How to determine another set of items B to make sure that every item in set B is strongly associated to set A when market basket analysis system receives a set of items A Obviously, a quantitative method to measure the strength of association relationship between set of items A and any other item is needed A new concept is introduced for this purpose: Similarity g,A,p\re, g represents a certain item, and A represents a certain set \(sequence\ items, p represents a certain association rule. Similarity \(g,A,p\is used to measure the similarity between the process of “recommend p.second according to p.first” and the process of “recommend item g according to a set \(sequence\ items A” quantitatively Similarity\(g,A,p\s calculated as Equation\(1  Similarity\(g,A,p\ = \(|p.first 002õ\000G characteristics in A p.second 002õ\000G characteristics in g  p.first| * |p.second|\     \(1  To any set of items A and any item g which is excluded from set A, the strength of association relationship between g and A can be defined as function Elem_t Relation\(A,g the pseudo code is Elem_t Strength_set\(A, g Elem_t ret = 0 For_each\(p in P ret=ret+p.strength*Similarity\(g,A,p return ret  Here is the description of variable names and symbols P: a set of item characteristic association rules p: an item characteristic association rule p.first: antecedents of association rule p p.second: consequent of association rule p p.strength: strength of rule p, generally, represented by the confidence of the rule B 002  On Condition That the Request Format is a Sequence of Items  When a client receives a sequence of items S, S can be considered as a sequence of items a consumer purchased What a market basket analysis system should do is to forecast consumers’ purchasing behavior and give scientific suggestions Suppose S is a sequence of items, Snext is a new sequence which is generated by inserting a new item in the end of S. What the system should do next is to obtain a new set of items B that is strongly associated to sequence Snext  Define a sequence Spre, of which S is generated by inserting a new item in the end. Define two sets of association rules C and D. C is made up of those association

rules which have at least one characteristic in antecedent that exists in sequence Spre. D is made up of those association rules which have at least one characteristic in antecedent that exists in sequence S. It is obvious that C is a subset of D Consider following two calculating processes Process 1: Client receives a sequence of items Spre, set of association rules C plays a role in the process of generating set of items B Process 2: Client receives a sequence of items S, set of association rules D plays a role in the process of generating set of items B In the second process, set D-C is more important than set C because set C has been considered in process 1  Another concept is introduced: Weight \(p,S certain sequence S and two different association rules p1 and p2, “Weight\(p1,S\eight\(p2,S\hen and only when p1 is more important in the process of generating set B To calculate Weight \(p,S\a function f\(x\hich is monotonically increasing in natural numbers is necessary Typically, f\(x\e defined as “f\(x\x * x * x Weight\(p,S\ can be calculated as follows Elem_t Weight\(p,S   Elem_t sum = 0, t = 0 for_each\(attribute in p.first for \(i = 1; i <= S.size if \(attribute is in S    sum+=i; t    if \(time==0\return 0 return f\(sum / time  Similarly, when the request format is sequence of items, to any sequence of items S and any item g which is excluded from sequence S, the strength of association relationship between g and S can be defined as function Elem_t Strength_sequence\(A,g\do code is shown as follows Elem_t Strength_sequence\(A,g Elem_t ret = 0 For_each\(p in P ret = ret + p.strength * Weight\(p Similarity\(g,S,p return ret  So far, we can use a quantitative way to measure the strength of association relationship between any item g and a set \(sequence\ items S. Set of items B can be obtained by selecting items which are highly associated to the set of items A\(sequence of items S\ according to the practical situation. It is regarded that there is certain association relationship between set of items A \(sequence of items S and set of items B IV EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS Three groups of data mining experiments were done on a given huge historical sales database which is obtained from a restaurant with 12613 trading records. We set minimum support to 0.01 and minimum confidence to 0.1 Results of the experiments are analyzed in the end of this section A. First Experiment The object of data mining in this experiment is the original transaction database which contains 722 kinds of goods and 63425 sale records including large numbers of fruits and drinks. 119 association rules are obtained in this experiment Here are 5 association rules with highest confidence Format of the rules is: Antecedents of association rule Antecedents count ==> Consequent of association rule Consequent count [confidence of 1 017+N M\010\012T\007T\003\031f 148 C4E 021ã\035p 139 conf=0.94  2 C4E 021ã\035p 017+N 8Å\(\011\012j\0135 154 017+N 4v G 128 [conf=0 3 017+N 8Å\(\011\012j\0135 316 017+N 4vG 258 conf=0.82  4 017+N 8Å\(\011\\\017J9\012 017+N 8Å\(\011\012j\0135 204

Moreover, the process of data mining lasts too long Why are most items in the antecedents and consequents of association rules not mainstream food? The reason is that there are only limited kinds of fruits and drinks in database thus it is at a high probability that consumers buy a certain set of fruits and drinks. This kind of biased data in database seriously affects the quality of data mining Another question is how to save time in the process of data mining. Time complexity of discovering association rules in a frequent item-set is an exponential function whose parameter is the rank of the frequent item-set. So removing uninterested data can help to save time in the process of data mining B. Second Experiment The object of data mining in the second experiment is the transaction database after the process of data cleaning in which non-interest data is removed. In the cleaned database there are 377 kinds of goods and 30156 sale records. 71 association rules are discovered in the process of data mining on cleaned database Here are 5 association rules with highest confidence 1 023±\012G\(/\030 66 T¥6µ\036æ\(/\030 24 [con 2 024F\030\0259\012\035å9 90 011 \036æRP\017\010 29 [conf=0 3 J•\035SOmEw\(/\035 83 8Å\(\0114Ó8F\021ã&f 24 conf=0.29  4 011\M&9 145 GL9°RP 38 [conf=0.2  5 010'B5 135 030\023\014¯\0217B\032 34 [conf=0 The advantage of this experiment is that most items in data mining result are mainstream food. Time cost of the data mining is greatly reduced compared to the first experiment The disadvantage is that only a small part of the whole items exist in data mining result. It is hard to get a reasonable explanation for association rules    A question raised from the experiment is whether there are any similar association rules. Support and confidence of most association rules in this experiment are both low because of similar food in menu. Different rules may reflect same features in consumers’ buying behavior, e.g., rule  EwRP 115 030\023\014¯\0217B\032  28 [conf=0.2  and rule  GL 9°RP 166 030\023\014¯\0217B\032 32 [conf=0.19 One f eature  they both reflect is if one consumer choose goods RP Yu the consumer will probably choose 014¯\0217B\032 Sijidou\next There are some association rules with high confidence but low support which can not be obtained by association rule mining algorithm but show similar feature in consumers buying behavior which obtained rules reflect   Item characteristic association rules such as “whoever likes hot food may also like soup” can not be obtained in traditional market basket analysis method. This kind of rules will be obtained directly in the third experiment C. Third experiment In this experiment, characteristics of each item are generated by taking ICTCLAS as the tool of word segmentation and taking catering lexicon together with daily words as segmentation lexicon before mining association rules on the items’ internal characteristics[5  Before the process of data mining, the trading record which is in the format of a set of items must be transformed into the format of a set of items’ characteristics. A piece of trading record is represented as { ID1,{G1 001 G2 001  001 Gm when ID1 is record number,{G1 001 G2 001  001 Gm}is the set of items people purchased together. Item Gi has ni characteristics, the set of characteristics belong to Gi is Gi-1 001 Gi-2 001  001 Gi-ni}. After be transformed into a set of items’ characteristic, the trading record is represented as ID1,{ G1-1 001 G1-2 001  001 G1 n1,G2-1 001 G2-2 001  001 G2-n2 001 G3-1 001  001 Gm-1 001 Gm-2 001  001 Gm-nm}}. If there are same characteristics in the transformed record only one of them is retained There are 1873 pieces of association rules obtained in the third experiment. Some of the prominent item characteristic association rules are listed as follows 1 OmJ•\035S 277 Ew 231 [conf=0.8

Association rules which can be explained easily can reflect the essence of customers’ buying behavior The disadvantage is that if the name of item can not reflect its characteristics, then the method is useless, e.g  V<U\003Þ\035 Mayishangshu D. Experiment Conclusion Experiment results were shown in Table 1  TABLE 1.

With same minimum support and confidence, the third experiment results in much more association rules than the first two experiments with less time cost. If the time cost in the process of word segmentation is not considered, time cost in the third experiment is the least. The experiment results show that a large number of association rules can be obtained with the innovative market basket analysis method. In the cases where the traditional analysis method cannot obtain enough association rules that policy makers are interested in, the innovative market basket analysis method can provide more scientific decision support for retail market and consumers buying behavior 001\015\000\021\000\003 CONCLUSIONS We know that in some cases, market basket analysis does not provide useful information if data-item of the market basket analysis is the name of goods. In this paper we proposed a new market basket analysis method which integrates words segmentation technology and association rule mining technology. Characteristics of items can be generated automatically before mining association rules by using word segmentation technology. This method has been applied to a restaurant equipped with electronic ordering system to give recommendations to customers, where the experiments were done. The experiment results show that the method is efficient and valid REFERENCES 1 J. Ha n a nd M.

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIs   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
