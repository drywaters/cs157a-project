10 BIOGRAPHY   10 1 INTRODUCTION The MIL-STD-1553 serial data bus has been the main avionics data bus on military aircraft since its development in the late 1960's and early 1970's 1 2 The original 1 Mb/s data rate is relatively slow compared to current serial interfaces The low bandwidth creates several problems for system integrators Due in part to the limited bandwidth many aircraft use multiple independent buses It is not uncommon for an aircraft to contain six or more 1553 buses The low 
bandwidth can also limit the time available to perform computations as various avionics subsystems must sit idle for portions of each time slice as they wait for updated data to be transmitted from other subsystems Several hardware solutions are available to increase the bandwidth but they all have disadvantages MIL-STD1553 has recently been revised to included higher data rates 3 The higher data rates may be obtained without changes to the aircraft cabling However new bus interface 1 1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

2 IEEEAC paper 1469 Version 4 Updated December 13 2007 hardware is required in all of the subsystems that will take advantage of the higher data rates Another hardware solution is to replace or supplement the older MIL-STD1553 bus with a newer bus protocol such as Fibre Channel which has Gigabit data rate capabilities 4 However costs for such a system are often prohibitive due to massive rewiring efforts Typically any changes to hardware will require that the interface software also be changed A potentially better option for many 
applications is to change the software to extend the capabilities of the existing MIL-STD-1553 systems This paper presents software techniques for extending the effective data rate of legacy 1 Mbps MIL-STD-1553 buses Based on an analysis of data from a modem aircraft the F/A18 C and D versions we have developed several lossless data compression algorithms suitable for implementation in real-time safety and mission critical systems The data compression algorithms that will be presented meet several criteria that make them suitable for such applications These 
criteria include 1 Lossless compression techniques are employed That is no information is lost as part of the compression and decompression process 2 The algorithms have been designed to take maximum advantage of the legacy MIL-STD-1553 message format and to complement the design philosophy of the standard In particular all compression and decompression is performed on individual 1553 messages Many transmission errors that occur can be detected as each message is received and handled with the existing error handling software 
3 All data compression techniques can result in data expansion under worst case conditions These compression routines set fixed limits on the worst case expansion making their performance highly predictable allowing the routines to be used in a deterministic system 4 The algorithms require very little computational power for both compression and decompression All of the algorithms require only one pass through the data with a few simple assembly language or equivalent HLL operations per word of data to be transmitted 1 


5 The algorithms have small memory requirements for the program changes and little or no extra memory for data storage Reference 5 has applied differential compression to files containing executable code for software updates This application is similar to ours in that the authors are targeting devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants that have limited communications bandwidth and limited processing power They also discuss the use of decompression in place algorithms that use little memory above that needed for the decompressed file Their application differs from ours in at least one very important aspect They assume that the file to be transmitted is compressed offline on a much more powerful computer This allows the use of asymmetric compression algorithms that place the majority of the work on the compression side Our application assumes limited processing power is available on both ends of the communication channel 2 DATA COMPRESSION Data Compression reduces the amount of signal space used to represent information The signal space can be characterized in terms of as memory space a transmission time interval or bandwidth which are all interrelated 6 Compression can have many benefits depending on its application A few of these advantages include reduced communication time reduced transmission errors and increased security against illicit monitoring 7 For a serial communication system data compression allows greater bus utilization by allowing more data to be sent during a given transmission time interval reducing the transmission time for sending a fixed amount of data or by some combination of both Compression may be implemented through many techniques that result in either lossy or lossless compression Lossy compression reduces the data size by identifying data that carries the least information and throwing it away This means that when the data is uncompressed the result will not be identical to the original pre-compressed representation resulting in a loss of information Lossy compressing routines are frequently used for picture and video compression Examples of lossy compression include JPEG and MPEG compression Lossless compression reduces redundancy in input data and is reversible resulting in decoded data that is identical to its pre-compressed form 8 Lossless compression is necessary for safety critical systems such as avionics The effectiveness of a compression routine is most commonly measured through the achieved compression ratio This method of comparison is defined as the ratio of the original size of the data over the size of the compressed data Therefore an algorithm that takes input data that is 300 bytes and reduces it to 100 bytes has a compression ratio of 3 6 The cost associated with data compression lies in the increased computational and memory resources that are required for achieving compression Further costs lie in the additional system complexity that is required for implementing compression and the associated potential risk of losing data should the compression algorithms fail to provide adequate compression For this study the limitation on computational resources was a very important restriction and led us to investigate lossless compression algorithms that can be implemented without large computational and memory requirements It should be noted that if data compression is used to reduce the transmission time between two computers in an avionics system the computational bandwidth of the system can be increased This can occur in spite of the fact that the compression routines impose additional computational requirements on the system This surprising result is a consequence of the fact that most avionics systems use a time-sliced operating system At the beginning of a time slice multiple computers exchange data over the MIL-STD1553 data bus While waiting for the data the computers are typically idle Once the data transfer completes the amount of processing that can be performed on the incoming data is limited by the fact that the processing must be completed prior to the end of the time slice To assure that this condition is met the processing routines do not use all of the available time The processing routines finish before the end of the time slice and the processors sit idle or process non critical information until the start of the next time slice When the data compression routines were simulated between the two mission computers of the F/A18 C/D the total time required to compress the data transfer the compressed data over the bus and decompress the data was significantly less that the time required to transfer the uncompressed data This resulted in a corresponding reduction in the time that each mission computer spent waiting to receive the data and a net increase in the time that was available to each mission computer for processing the data during each time slice More details concerning this result are provided latter in this paper The ultimate performance of any data compression routine depends upon the statistical nature of the data that is compressed This implies that performance of the data compression algorithms will be probabilistic to some degree This uncertainty can cause concerns when data compression is applied in a real-time mission critical and safety critical system Such a system needs to be deterministic in the sense that the worst-case performance of the systems is bounded The data compression algorithms presented in this paper were designed with this in mind 3 ANALYSIS OF MIL-STD-15553 BUS DATA A short presentation of a subset of MIL-STD-1553 and of the F/A18 C/D avionics system will be provided in the next few paragraphs This will serve to place the remaining 2 


discussion in context This will be followed with an analysis of statistical characteristics of MIL-STD1553 bus traffic from the F/A18 MIL-STD-1553 was developed for use in military avionics systems 1 It uses a command-response format where one computer the bus controller directs all of the communication on the bus 2 The other computers on the bus are called remote terminals The remote terminals are identified using a 5-bit remote terminal address Each remote terminal has a 5-bit sub-address The sub-address field serves two purposes Two of the sub-address values identify special operating modes The other thirty values are used to specify one of thirty message blocks to be transmitted or received Data transfer on the 1553 bus consists of individual message transfer sequences Each message is directed to or from a specific remote terminal and a specific sub-address Each message may transfer one to thirty two 16-bit data words This limits the number of data words that may be sent or received by any one remote terminal to a maximum of 960 This limit arises from 30 different sub-addresses available for data transfer in each remote terminal and the 32 data word maximum associated with each sub-address The product of these two parameters yields the limit of 960 words Each 16-bit word is sent with 4 framing bits using Manchester bi-phase encoding The 16 information bits are preceded by a 3-bit sync pattern and followed by a parity bit that implements odd parity A high degree of error detection is incorporated in the specification Each message is checked for proper formatting and length Multiple checks are performed for each word including checks for a valid sync character proper Manchester encoding a full 16 bits plus parity and that parity is odd Each remote terminal involved in a message sequence responds to the bus controller with a status word that flags any errors MILSTD-1553 does not specify how to respond to an error The error handling is left to the system designers Typically the software in the bus controller will respond to an error by repeating the message one or more times The avionics system of the F/A-18 C/D aircraft is typical of most modem military aircraft The system includes two computers called mission computers connected to six MILSTD-1553 buses The mission computers are designated MCI and MC2 Either mission computer may serve as the bus controller on any of the avionics buses This provides redundancy in the bus controller function However only one mission computer can be the bus controller at any given time One of the six buses is used primarily for intercomputer data transfer between the two mission computers The other buses are used to communicate to a host of avionics subsystems The mission computer software operates in a time-sliced mode with a new time slice starting every 50 ms 20 Hz Data transmissions on the F/A-18's MIL-STD-1553 data buses are divided into groups of words sent at varying periodic rates These groups are referred to as rate groups There are 20 Hz 10 Hz 5 Hz and 1 Hz rate groups In order to become familiar with the statistics of the data that is commonly passed on one of the MIL-STD-1553 buses of F/A-18 C/D Aircraft personnel at the F/A-18 Advanced Weapons Lab supplied twelve bus traces to researchers at Baylor University Each of the bus traces captured approximately ten seconds of data which included the start up sequence of both mission computers and various operating modes and flight conditions The bus traces data characteristics were statistically analyzed in MATLAB after creating a data structure to easily access and manipulate the data The statistical analysis was broken up by rate group and also by which mission computer sent the data The statistical analysis revealed two important findings The first finding was that the data has a significant number of zero values for each rate group That is many of the 16-bit data words had all 16-bits set to zero The second finding is that a significant number of message values do not change in consecutive transmissions Table 1 provides a brief summary of these two findings Complete details of the

operations and thus is suitable for real-time implementation The first method takes advantage of the fact that most of the data in the bus traces consisted of words that were all zeros The second scheme is a form of run-length encoding This type of encoding takes advantage of situations where the data contains relatively long runs of consecutive identical numbers The last scheme differential encoding is designed to exploit the fact that the majority of the message data does not change from one transmission to the next Common-value-tracking As mentioned in the previous section the F/A18 data 3 


contained a significant number of words with the hexadecimal value OxOOOO This compression method takes advantage of this fact by effectively representing zeros with a single bit instead of transmitting the full 16 bits for each zero word For the F/A 18 application we call this method zero-tracking The same method could be applied to any commonly occurring data word in which case a more generic name for this compression method would be common-value tracking The specifics of zero-tracking encoding will now be examined The method works with a fixed length blocks of data words For illustrative purposes suppose this length is set at 16 16-bit data words The encoder takes these 16 words and uses a single bit to represent the position of each data word that has a value of zero The encoder reserves the first 16-bit word of the encoded sequence as a placeholder that identifies the position of zero versus non-zero words Bits in each placeholder word are set to 1 in positions corresponding to zero words in the input buffer The encoded data consists of the placeholder word followed by non-zero data words listed in the original order of their appearance It should be noted that the zero may be substituted any other common data value and that the common value could be changed from block to block Table 2 illustrates the encoding of a length 16 block of data using zero-tracking Table 2 Zero-Tracking ncoding Word Input ZT Encoded Count Data Data Hex Hex Hex 0 O 1 C0 7 1 0 1 FFFF 2 FFFF O 59 3 59 O AC9F 4 0 I 486 5 AC9F O F5A9 6 0 0 7 0 1 8 0 9 0 A 486 B 0 C F5A9 O D 0 X E 0 1 F 0 X Note that in the table the zero-values are removed from the encoded data The column marked ZT in the table indicates the value of the placeholder zero-tracking bit which forms the first word of the encoded message Note that the first four words in the input buffer have two zeros followed by two non-zeros Thus the corresponding ZT values of 1100=OxC The remaining zero-locations result in the first word word 0 of the encoded data having the value OxCBD7 In this instance the scheme saves 10 data words yielding a compression ratio of 2.667 To decode the data the algorithm steps though the first 16 bits of the encoded data and inserts zeros into the decoded stream in locations indicated by a 1 If the bit is a zero the scheme places the next number from the encoded data stack into the output stream The premise behind zero-tracking encoding can be applied to any value and is not limited to a zero Therefore the algorithm is useful for application to data that is composed of a significant proportion of a particular value In the case of the F/A18 the particular value happened to be zero but if on another bus the value happened to be FFFF the algorithm could easily be adapted As shown this compression scheme has several desirable properties It is a very simple scheme that requires only one pass through the data for encoding and one pass for decoding It fits well with the block size of MIL-STD1553 It results in a well defined and relatively small impact on the maximum data size when the data cannot be compressed The block size of a MIL-STD-1553 data transfer is specified by the word count field of the command word The block size may consist of 1 to 32 16-bit words The maximum benefit from data compression occurs when more data is transmitted As shown above with common-value tracking one data word is added to encode 16 useful data words When the data does not contain any of the common values this could result in an expansion from 16 data words to 17 or a compression ratio of 16/17 If a 32-word block is compressed two data words are required to indicate the position of the common-valued data words This suggests an implementation wherein the maximum number of words that can be transmitted in any block is limited to a maximum of 31 words This leaves a spare bit in the two position-indicating words By taking advantage of this bit it is possible to transmit 31 uncompressed data words in a block of 32 words when compression is not possible limiting the worst case compression ratio to 31/32 This is accomplished by using one bit of the first positionindicating word to indicate if compression has been implemented on the following 31 words or not For example if the most-significant bit of the word is a one it could indicate that the following 31 words represent uncompressed data If the lead bit is a zero it would indicate that the data is compressed and that the current word and the one that follows should be interpreted as position indicating words Since compression would only be used when at least one of the 31 data words is equal to the common value and therefore can be eliminated there will be a maximum of 30 data words in the remainder of the block Therefore 31 data words can always be sent in a 32word block The best compression ratio in using this scheme would be 31/2 or 15.5 to 1 4 


It should be noted that this scheme also allows compression to be easily suppressed should the need arise For example every Nth block could be sent uncompressed to assist in error correction Alternately if less than a predetermined number of common value words are contained in the data compression may be skipped to avoid the computational cost of decoding the data Other variations on this scheme are possible For example if a maximum of 31 useful data words are to be sent in each 32-word block then an extra bit is available in one of the two position-indicating words This bit could be used to select between two different common values for the current block It should also be noted that the value of the common value word may be uniquely predetermined for each remote terminal address and sub-address This could be interpreted as incorporating a codebook approach where the codebook is generated offline and hard-coded into the operating system to save execution time Run-length Encoding Run-length encoding is a popular technique for achieving lossless compression 10 A common method for implementing a run-length scheme involves producing a marker sequence to indicate the presence of a repeated sequence of transmitted values 10 For this implementation runs of consecutive identical words are encoded by recording the first two entries to serve as a marker that indicates the presence of a run of the number followed by the run length If a number to be encoded is not a part of a group of consecutive identical numbers then the number is copied to the encoded matrix and the process moves to the next number to be encoded Table 3 provides an example of the process In this instance the scheme saves six data words yielding a compression ratio of 1.6  Useful compression is achieved when runs of 4 or more identical numbers are present in the input data In the worst case when the data words consist only of runs of two consecutive identical words the compression ratio would be 0.667 When the algorithm encodes runs of three there is no compression or expansion compression ratio of 1 We regarded the potential for a large degree of expansion as a serious drawback for a traditional RLE based technique To mitigate this problem we developed an alternate method for implementing a run-length approach This modified version of RLE is shown in the Table 4 The modified RLE method combines the position-indicating scheme developed for the common-value compression routine with run-length encoding In this case a zero bit in the position-indicating word indicates that a value does not repeat A one indicates a run When the first position bit with a value of 1 is encountered the data value for the run is read from the data section of the block After that this value is repeated for each word with a corresponding one in the position indicating word When a zero bit is encountered the run is terminated and values are read from the data section pending another run A problem occurs for adjacent runs of different values in that a zero bit is required to terminate the previous run The solution requires that the second run must have more than 2 values to get compressed As with common-value tracking in a block of 32 words a single bit can be used to indicate that compression has not been used This limits the worst case expansion to 31/32 Table 3 Run-Length Encoding Word Input Encoded Count Data Data Hex Hex Hex 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 3 3 FFFF FFFF 4 5604 5604 5 5604 5604 6 5604 7 7 5604 984 8 5604 984 9 5604 5 A 5604 B 984 C 984 D 984 E 984 F 984 Table 4 Run-Length Encoding-Modified Word Input RT Encoded Count Data Data Hex Hex Hex 0 O  E0EF 1 0 1 0 2 0 1 FFFF 3 FFFF 0 5604 4 5604  984 5 5604 X 984 6 5604 1 7 5604 X 8 5604 9 5604 A 5604 1 B 984 0 C 984 D 984 E 984 X F 984 1 The first word in the encoded block indicates the status of a run Each bit of this encoded word is indicated by the column in the table that is labeled RT For example the 5 


first 3 data points in the block have value 0 and the run terminates with a value of FFFF The RT value is set to one for the first three data points and is cleared to zero when the run terminates Accordingly the first four bits of the initial word are given by 1110 OxE After a run terminates the value of the next run including runs of length one is appended to the encoded data Note that for this example the compression ratio is 2.66 Differential Encoding As indicated in Table 1 a significant portion of the data sent for a given rate group does not change from one transmission to the next A differential encoding scheme has been developed to take advantage of this property of the data The method can best be explained in terms of two buffers filled with data words from consecutive captures of a specific rate group to be sent over the bus as shown in Table 5 The first buffer holds the data from the earlier capture and the second holds data from the current buffer For this example the buffer length is 16 In practice the buffer length can be specified by the number of data words to be transmitted for a given rate group Table 5 Differential Encoding Word Previous Current Encode Con Data Data d Data t9 Hx Hex Hex DT Hex 0 0054 0054 0 2022 1 0815 0815 0 AFOO 2 AF58 AFOO 1 4567 3 0000 0000 0 AAAA 4 0000 0000 5 6542 6542 6 FFFF FFFF 0 7 9542 9542 0 8 BC65 BC65 0 9 0000 0000 O A 0000 4567 l B 0000 0000 0 C 8966 8966 0 D 8966 8966 0 E 5634 AAAA F 0054 0054 0 The differential method uses a single bit to represent each buffer location This collection of bits is placed at the beginning of the transmitted block Each bit in the collection is set when the corresponding data value in the buffer changes from the previous value Each bit in the collection is cleared if the corresponding data value in the buffer does not change from the previous value For the example illustrated in Table IV the location of 16 values in the buffer can be represented by the first word word 0 in the encoded data block As indicated by the DT column from Table IV only buffer locations 2 10 and 15 have values that change between transmissions Thus the bit position word has value Ox2022 The updated values for these locations are then placed consecutively in the encoded buffer The decoding process is straightforward Each buffer location bit is checked and should that bit be set the next data word from the encoded block is written to the appropriate decoded block Should the value of the location bit be cleared the corresponding location from the previous buffer is retained Note that the use of differential encoding for this example results in a compression ration of 4 5 IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES The extent in which a data compression scheme affects the overall system performance depends a great deal on how the compression scheme is implemented Issues such as the transmission buffer size mode-changes the effect of transmission errors and computational bandwidth are important factors to consider in implementing a data compression scheme for bus traffic Variable Length Transmission Size A decision must be made in regard to how the length of a 1553 transmission is determined By a variable length transmission we mean one in which each 1553 message sequence is adjusted to be only as long as needed for each transmission In the case of individual 1553 messages this means that the number of words in the message is adjusted for each transmission If multiple messages are used to send a block of data that is larger than 31 words then this means that the number of messages is adjusted for each transmission of the block At the end of an individual message or after the last message in a block has been received an interrupt is generated and the CPU can decompress the data This approach guarantees that minimal time is spent waiting for data thereby making additional time available for processing For variable length transmissions the average and maximum compression performance statistics are important in assessing the benefits of compression A disadvantage to this approach is related to mode changes A mode change in this case refers to a major change in the operating mode of an aircraft An example of such a change is changing from a navigation mode to a combat mode Note that a start-up condition can be considered a form of mode change A mode change has the potential to produce sets of data that do not compress to a great extent A variable length transmission block could possibly require a large enough transmission time so that the subsequent processing algorithms do not finish within one time slice Note that mode changes are transient conditions that only occur for a few time slices and that steady state conditions are quickly restored To mitigate this effect it is desirable to order the data processing routines so that the most critical routines are executed first Non-critical computational tasks can then be deferred to the next time slice 6 


Fixed Length Transmission Size Another approach for implementing compression is to use a fixed length transmission The advantage of this approach lies in the fact that a fixed transmission length is very easy to implement and analyze Also it assures a fixed amount of time is always available for data processing The disadvantage of this approach lies in the trade between compression performance and assuring that all of the data from a given transmission will fit in the allocated block To assure the later a conservatively large transmission block size should be used to assure that all of the compressed data will fit in the transmission buffer One approach for determining the length of the transmission is to use the compression ratio corresponding to the minimum compression statistics since it is desirable that the transmission length would accommodate worst case conditions Alternatively the average comprehension ratio can be used to set the transmission length resulting in the greatest steady-state performance Mode changes that result in poor compression performance are an issue when using a fixed transmission length Fixed-length transmissions will be illustrated with two examples The first example concerns the case where the transmission length is fixed as a portion of an individual 1553 message As discussed earlier such a message can send up to 31 words of data using any of the three compression algorithms If the average compression ratio is slightly better than 3 then the message length can be fixed at 10 words The first two words will hold the location run or change tracking data as required by the compression algorithm The last eight words will hold the data values As long as the data can be compressed from 31 words down to 10 this method will always provide fresh data As a second example consider the case when multiple messages are used to transfer a large block of data Assume the block size is 320 16-bit data words Without compression this could be transferred using ten 1553 messages of 32 words each If the average compression ratio is 3 then this can be reduced to three 1553 messages of 32 words each and a fourth message of 11 words This was the approach we initially tested with data from the F/A18 Using this data during the worst case mode change it was found that the system will catch up with all of the changed data in four or five transmissions which corresponds to 0.25 seconds for 20 Hz transmissions In the mean time the avionics system will be working with some fresh data and some data that is older stale After a major mode change most systems will be starting with stale data even without compression so this may not be a problem It should be noted that methods for handling the modechange transient condition are still under investigation A dual-mode technique wherein data compression is effectively turned off during start-up conditions and restored for steady-state conditions is under consideration Transmission Error Effects Data errors may occur in any form of data transmission with the MIL-STD-1553 data bus being no exception The effects of data errors can be amplified when using data compression This section will examine the potential effects of errors when using any of the proposed data compression schemes It should be noted that this section only refers to errors that do not get caught by the error checking capabilities included in MIL-STD1553 proper Manchester coding parity etc Errors can occur in two types of data words within the any of the routines The error may occur in the first word or words that are used to track the common value the run positions or the difference positions Alternatively the error may occur in one of the words that represents a data value Depending upon the encoding scheme the impact of errors in these two types of words is different and will be discussed in the following paragraphs It should be noted that for all of the methods if the error occurs in a flag bit that is used to indicate if the following data is compressed or not then the entire message could be interpreted erroneously Methods to reduce the likelihood or detect this and other errors are discussed in this section In zero tracking if the error is in a data word that represents one of the non-zero numbers then that word is the only word negatively affected Note that this is the same impact that is inherent in non-compressed 1553 data transmissions If a bit error occurs in the position tracking word then the data word corresponding to that bit will be wrong and all of the data words in the remainder of the message will be misplaced In the worst case this means that all of the remaining words will be wrong Since a maximum of 31 words can be transmitted in any message this could impact up to 31 words However in most cases this type of error could be detected within the decompression routine when using variable-length messages as the number of data words will not match the number required after the error The only exception to this would be a multiple-bit error that does not change the parity of the word nor the total number of ones or zeros in the word Such an error would be very rare Errors in run-length compression transmissions have somewhat worse effects As with zero tracking if an error occurs in one of the run tracking data words then the decoder may incorrectly end or extend a run As a result the placement of the following words will all be shifted Again such an error could be detected in most cases by the decompression routine if variable-length messages are used If an error occurs in one of the data words then this error will be repeated for all of the words in the run This is a slightly worse result than data word errors in zero tracking For differential encoding the potential impacts are the 7 


slightly better than for zero tracking If the error is in a word that represents one of the data words whose value has changed then that is the only word impacted If a bit error occurs in the difference tracking word then the data corresponding to that bit will be wrong and in the worst case all of the data words to be updated i.e that correspond to difference-tracking bits that are set to one in the remainder of the message will be incorrect However words that are correctly identified as not changing will not be corrupted Since this method achieves high compression ratios the impacts of this type of error may be significantly less than for the other two routines In most cases errors will have the greatest impact if they change one of the two words that hold the location run or difference tracking bits If an error analysis proves that extra error protection is required a third word could be used to add extra error detection for these bits This third word would reduce the maximum compression ratio slightly and increase the complexity of the compression scheme In summary MIL-STD1553 will eliminate most potential errors If an error does get past the MIL-STD-1553 error checking the potential for error propagation within a compressed message is greatest for the run-length method and least for the differential method The probability of an error can not be eliminated but the effects of errors can be mitigated by using other techniques such as additional error checking within the decompression routine or using one of the data words in each message for error detection and/or correction Further work is being performed in this area Computational Bandwidth As mentioned previously the computational cost of compressing and uncompressing the bus data is an important consideration A timing analysis of the compression zero-tracking algorithm has been completed and efforts for performing a similar analysis the modified RLE and Differential methods are ongoing To complete the timing analysis of the zero-tracking routine the algorithms for compression and uncompressing were written in AYK-14 assembly language the native language of the F/A18 mission computer The time required to compress a block of data is estimated by taking each instruction executed in the program and looking up its associated number of micro-instructions performed by the processor The time it takes to complete a micro-instruction 62.5 ns is then multiplied by the number microinstructions in the routine to arrive at the total time requirement for the data compression For zero-tracking the estimated time for compression is 72 microseconds and for uncompressing is 51 microseconds For a 3 to 1 compression ratio this results in an overall time-slice savings of approximately 677 microseconds This additional time is now available to the mission computers thereby increasing computational bandwidth 6 COMPRESSION PERFORMANCE The compression performance for all three compression algorithms is summarized in Tables 6 7 and 8 Table 6 Zero-Tracking Compression Ratios Rate Group 5 Hz MC MCI MC2 Maximum 5.66 5.66 Minimum 2.04 2.04 Average 2.44 2.60 Rate Group 10 Hz 20 Hz MC MCI MC2 MCI MC2 Maximum 7.20 4.12 10.05 9.56 Minimum 3.54 3.14 2.12 1.55 Average 4.65 3.39 2.63 1.66 Table 7 Run-Length Compression Ratios Rate Group 5 Hz MC MCI MC2 Maximum 2.35 1.18 Minimum 1.44 1.03 Average 2.13 1.17 Rate Group 10 Hz 20 Hz MC MC I MC2 MCI MC2 Maximum 2.50 4.58 1.45 2.73 Minimum 2.34 1.75 1.3 1.49 Average 2.44 2.80 1.34 1.97 Table 8 Differential Compression Ratios Rate Group 5 Hz MC MCI MC2 Maximum 15.00 1.35 Minimum 1.48 1.06 Average 8.37 1.31 Rate Group 10 Hz 20 Hz MC MCI MC2 MCI MC2 Maximum 14.69 15.22 16.00 12.94 Minimum 3.21 1.79 1.57 1.92 Average 14.47 7.22 12.47 5.74 The performance analysis was conducted using data from multiple bus traces of data captured at the F/A 18 Advanced Weapons Laboratory Each trace represented roughly 30 seconds of flight data and included examples of modechanges and start-up conditions Note that these statistics were compiled on a message block basis That is the entire message sequence for a given rate group is collected to form a larger transmission block For the case of zero-tracking and RLE this message block was decomposed into smaller data blocks 30 words with the compression algorithms applied sequentially to the smaller data blocks For both zero-tracking and RLE each of the smaller data blocks have a nonzero probability for expansion However the measures taken to mitigate data 8 


expansion limit the effects of expansion within an overall message block The minimum compression statistics indicate that even under mode changes zero-tracking and RLE provide a modest degree of compression The differential compression technique offers the most potential for data compression The differential compression method was implemented over the entire transmission block for a sequence of messages within a given rate group Furthermore the statistics for the differential technique are presented only for steady-state conditions The differential compression technique is very sensitive to start-up conditions due to the fact that the initial values in the transmission buffer are initialized to zero For this reason we excluded start-up conditions from the analysis for the differential technique Further tests are needed to operate the F/A18 avionics system over a wide range of modes and scenarios to determine the suitability of each routine and the ultimate compression ratios achieved Based on the outcome of these tests one of these routines may be chosen for incorporation into the released software 7 CONCLUSIONS This paper has examined three data compression routines for possible use on the F/A-18 C/D aircraft The principal contributions of this paper are as follows 1 A statistical analysis of data gathered from the MIL-STD-1553 data buses of a modem aircraft the F/A18 C/D was summarized 2 Three data compression algorithms particularly applicable to the avionics systems that use MILSTD1553 and older legacy microprocessors were presented and analyzed The algorithms achieved minimum compression ratios greater than one in every tested case Therefore given the data provided only non-detrimental results occur With the best algorithm average compression ratios for 20 Hz and 10 Hz data ranged from 5.7 up to 14.5 3 It was demonstrated that the time required to compress and decompress the data can be more than offset by the savings in data transmission time 4 A discussion of system-level implementation considerations was provided including fixed vs variable message length implementations error detection and correction and how to handle transient conditions such as startup and mode changes when data may not be compressible The zero-tracking compression routines have been coded in AYK-14 assembly language the native language of the F/A-18 mission computer Also they have been integrated into a non-flight version the mission computer software to test the routines in the F/A18 Advanced Weapons Laboratory Preliminary simulations have been promising in that the system accurately delivered data over the bus from source to destination within set time limits The decompression results were as expected and functionality was maintained The run-length and differential encoding algorithms have yet to be coded in assembly but implementation is anticipated due to the potential for high compression ratios as seen in the data analysis 9

 11 dotprod_ function consumes 2.95 of the CPU time compared to the previously observed value of 9.97 Figure 10 However this does not mean the function execu ted faster. In fact, as seen in the results in Table 8 the speedup is negligible compared to an FPU-only system Table  6 The value for dotprod_ function is lower because the profiler does not include helper functions that are  called within the dotprod_ function otherwise the function main would consume 100% of CPU time\. These helper funct ions could include various low level data copy and manip ulation operations. In fact, the profile now shows new func tions that take up significant CPU time that were not visible before for example memcpy  The cumulative contribution of the helper functions to the overall execution time is t he reason why little speedup is seen with the dot-product coprocessor even with the dotprod_ function itself taking up less CPU time 6  R ESULTS A NALYSIS  Table 10 presents the execution times of all system s described in this paper Without a doubt the two s oftware optimizations using single-precision math library and Perflib  and the inclusion of the APU-FPU core together provide impressive speedup across the board That i s because the aforementioned optimizations affect nea rly all portions of the FTIR software improving both singl eprecision SP math functions and APU-FPU as well a s double-precision arithmetic Perflib  The dot-product co-processor core, however, has alm ost no effect on the system performance. This is most like ly due to the noncontiguous pattern of memory access in the d otproduct computation of the FTIR spectrometry algori thm As was shown earlier, smaller more uniformly access ed data sets can achieve nearly 2x speedup over the FPU whe n using the dot-product co-processor Comparing the best performing FTIR system build on the ML410 development board to a V2P based NASA JPL implementation in 7  s h o w s  a n  o v e r a l l  s p e e d u p  o f  1 78x Table 11 The results of the best performing FTIR  build are first scaled to the appropriate number of inter ferograms and detectors to match what was used in the NASA JP L V2P research task.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

  16  Figure 15. AIRS-AMSRE differences as a function of AIRS error estimate over one day  AIRS has an error estimate of the total water vapor value that it calculates. The diffe rences between AIRS and AMSR-E are shown as a function of this estimate in figure 15 and very little correlation is found 11  R ELEVANT W ORK  Merged A-Train Level 2 Data A merged product that preserves the relationship of observed atmospheric water properties facilitates the hydrological studies by enabling scientists to get directly at the model data without worrying about the logistics of finding, collecting, and coordinating the measured quantities from different instruments. Previously there did not exist a capability to discover and access data from the A-Train\222s multiple instruments as merged multi-parameter data sets Enabling Orchestratable Service Workflows Our distributed service-oriented approach of loosely coupled services also enable s a higher level of reusability and orchestration with other services. Increasing numbers of workflow engines are already supporting Web Services as components/operators, which can then be orchestrated together into higher-level meta/virtual services SciFlo, a Scientific Dataflow Execution Environment, is a workflow engine that already supports assembling reusable SOAP Services, native execu tables, local command-line scripts, and codes into a distributed computing flow \(a graph of operators\8 SciFlo can u tilize o u r g en eric SOAP services as part of a larger coordinated data flow The Taverna Workbench is a free software tool for designing and executing workflows. Like SciFlo, it can orchestrate SOAP-based Web Services as components within a workflow. Taverna provides a visual editor to construct and edit the sequence of services in the workflow We have found that Taverna can dynamically introspect a given WSDL and construct the workflow component interface representing it Giovanni Giovanni, an acronym for the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Cent er, or GES DISC, Interactive Online Visualization and Analys is Infrastructure, is a webbased tool to help visualize Earth science data  It  provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze and access vast amounts of Eart h science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Similar to the services developed here, it addresses the difficulties of traditional data acquisition and analysis methods by moving the complexity to the server-side Giovanni provides multiple in terface instances based on instrument and measurement ty pes. For example, the \223ATrain Along CloudSat Track Inst ance\224 can provide plots of vertical profiles of clouds, temperature, humidity, cloud and aerosol classification across the multiple instruments of the A-Train A distinction between Givanni\222s A-Train data and the data set in this paper is that we are using a formal merged product of the A-Train. We leverage the NEWS effort that is based on error- and resolution-weighted mean of the input data sets, with associated uncertainty estimates. This provides a formal model of the collective A-Train observations rather than the collection of the individual instrument measurements Each of Giovanni\222s multiple interface instances provides a very simple and easy to use web interface. However, we recognized that sometimes scientists want more than the simple interfaces. Some scien tists may want to process Level 3 products using their own trusted code, or may want to perform variations of their own plots. With Giovanni, the individual scientist wanting more custom advanced capabilities must depend on the Giovanni development team Giovanni is based on the web portal paradigm where users visit a web page and use web tools to find and visualize data. Similar to Giovanni, our client APIs also make data acquisition more seamless. However, our services are based on the different paradigm were the power and flexibility of data analysis and processing are shifted back into the scientists own familiar computing environments. We realize that scientists generally want to perform \223exploratory computing\224 where they can sere ndipitously analyze the data using their own familiar and trusted code 


  17 Giovanni 2 was inherently synchronous where processing was bounded to a single http session. Long service running times still require the user to hold the same http session Similar to our asynchronous Web Service we discussed, the upcoming Giovanni 3 will be supporting asynchronous sessions. They will be using a RSS feed to monitor the service request. Version 3 will also be based on a servicesoriented architecture, wher e Giovanni services can be offered as a standard SOAP Web Services. This is similar to our approach, as well as SciFlo\222s services 12  C ONCLUSIONS  To achieve the science research goal of investigating longterm and global-scale trends in climate, water and energy cycle, and weather variability, we enhanced and improved on existing algorithms to work with distributed and heterogeneous data and information systems infrastructure By developing a service-oriented architecture for discovering, accessing, and mani pulating of NEWS merged A-Train data sets, we can strengthen the interconnectedness and reusability of these services across broader range of Earth science investigations The merged NEWS Level 2 data is a formal model containing the voluminous data from the AIRS, AMSR-E MLS, MODIS, and CloudSat instruments. Previously scientists wanting to perform long-term and global-scale studies encompassing simultaneous measured quantities would quickly face a data acce ss hurdle of first finding the data, then manually downloading them, and finally merging the data into a cohesive model\227before starting their analysis. Additionally the voluminous nature of the data particularly because of the MODIS data\each scientist potentially downloading the same data resulting in redundancy of reprocessing on the client sides. Our paradigm pushes more of the commonly repeated processing onto the server side. Moreover, this avoids repeated downloading of the same data among the science users. We can deliver customi zed averaged, subsetted, and summarized data of the merged A-Train observations to the scientists for them to immediately begin their analysis work We recognized that scientists also often want to perform 223exploratory computing\224 where they can freely explore the aspects of the data and run serendipitous exploration in their own familiar environment. We developed client-side distributed APIs in popular analysis environments such as Matlab, IDL, and Python. Our APIs hide the complexity of Web Services and allow the service capabilities to be embedded in the scientists own computing environments By purposely avoiding the \223web portal\224 paradigm and providing the suite of platform specific APIs in each of these language platforms, we enable the scientists to remain within their own familiar environments to select, process and download the data seamlessly into their environment for their own further analysis. Alternative methods involving web portals force the scientists to leave the environment and manually interact with the web portal to search and download the data We can examine not only long-term changes in amplitude of a single variable but also those among multiple variables Our L3Q clustering method was specifically designed to preserve information about the covariability of multiple observations, such as those from the A-Train.  Weather and climate variability is characterized by changes among atmospheric observables, but those changes have been limited by a lack of observations and analytical techniques We are not aware of any multi-parameter analyses to date The full potential of the A-Train climate record will not be realized until the multi-parameter climatology is understood. The work presented is one method of approaching this difficult problem Our service tool addresses several objectives of the NASA Earth science data community including 1\mprove interoperability to facilitate the transparent access and manipulation of heterogeneous and distributed data by science users, 2\ransition and deploy existing Earth science research analysis tools and software using a 223Service Oriented Architecture\224 \(SOA\ to enhance their reuse potential for other science domains and improve overall awareness and access of these tools by a broad community, 3\ increase users\222 ability to customize their discovery, access, deliv ery, manipulation, and preferred format of data and information 12  F UTURE W ORK  On-demand Level 3T Summaries from Level 3Q We plan to develop services for creating custom summaries of the L3Q data into more refined Level 3T summaries L3T\create their own custom Level 3 products on demand from L3Q. The custom Level 3 products are the transformation of L3Q data based on user-specific objectives such as regression and correlation analyses. The cust om production will generate not only the transformed data but also the statistical estimation of the accuracy of the summarized data based on the distribution of L3Q and the quality of L3Q Delegating the Temporal-Spatial Data Querying Currently, our processing layer utilizes existing and legacy processing code that was developed in IDL, Matlab, and C++. Though the original intent was to be able to adapt existing code and wrap as a service, this meant maintaining its original form of accessing the source data for processing Small modifications were made to enable these codes to quickly access the data based on file path and file naming schemes. However, we want to decouple the file accessibility and processing roles 


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
