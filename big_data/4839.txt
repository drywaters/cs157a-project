information science domain. This paper proposes a document clustering technique based on term clustering and association rules. In this technique, extract words from document collection firstly, then construct term clustering according to AMI\(Average Mutual Information\ between terms, document VSM\(Vector Space Model\ is represented by term clustering, and use association rules to mine document clustering. Experiment results show that performance and clustering quality of this technique are improved than those of traditional methods in the clustering process Keywords-term clustering; association rules; web mining vector space model; document clustering 
I   I NTRODUCTION  In general, with difference of contents, web mining has three types: web structure mining, web usage mining and web content mining [1  D o c u m e nt clu s t e r i ng be l o n g s t o w e b  content mining and content mining is to find some models or rules implied in document collection, if see the whole process of content mining is an I/O system, document collection D is the input and implied models or rules MR is the output, so the task of content mining is to find a shine upon \247 from D to MR 247 DMR 
002 002 003  Document clustering process is different from document classification, it is not based on kinds of table or category 
system but documents themselves, namely, it uses documents to get the kind of document, the content and extension of the kinds and the whole category system are all completely determined by document collection which needs to do clustering. Now the commonly document clustering methods are hierarchical method, partitioning method, etc II  D OCUMENT F ORMAL D ESCRIPTION  A  Document Participle Process and Pretreatment Firstly do participle process to all documents in D, all terms obtained have formed a term collection, then do pretreatment to the term collection, the main steps of pretreatment are  According to far-between words table and inactive 
words table, remove all far-between words and inactive words from term collection Remove some words which have high appearance in lots of documents, such as some auxiliary verb, preposition, etc According to thesaurus to deal with some terms whose semantic are same or very related. choose formal terms in 223 Chinese Classification Themantic Words Table 224 to represent these terms whose semantic are same or very related,  seeing the formal terms are equal to these terms and operation on formal terms are equal to on these terms, such as \223malingshu\224 223tudou\224, \223yutou\224 are different names of potato, but only use 223malingshu\224 to represent potato in this paper 
B  Term Clustering Generally, there are some regulations in match process between terms, the representation is that there are some certain regular match relationship between terms and others, there are two type of similar relationship between two terms: semantic similar and semantic relevance, the semantic similar is about synonym and parasynonym, this has been processed before and using  AMI \(Average Mutual Information\ represent relevance degree of two terms AMI i T  j T   ij j 2 jij n\(T T  n\(T  log  n\(T  n\(T T

An association rule is an implication of the form p O  q O  where p O  P q O  P,and p O  q O   Support degree of association rule p O  q O is defined as: sup p O  q O  p q OO n  where, n is total number of objects in O confidence degree of this association rule is defined as: conf p O  q O  p q p OO O   let min_conf is minimum confidence degree, if conf p O  q O min_conf, we say association rule p O  q O is confidently B  Document Similar Degree The square root of product of Jaccard coefficient and Cosine coefficient is chosen to be document similar degree p q ts\(D D   p qpq js\(D D  cs\(D D     11 tt tt 22 24 p,i q,i p,i q,i p,i q,i p,i q,i i=1 i 1 i 1 i=1 r r r r r r   r  r           p q js\(D D  and p q cs\(D D  separately represents Jaccard coefficient and cosine coefficient; t is total number of term clustering in T p i r is relevance degree between p D and i TC  q,i r is relevance degree between q D and i TC  C  DHP Algorithm This technique uses DHP [4  a l go r i th m\(Di r e c t H a shi n g  and  Pruning\ to min association rules, it is an advanced algorithm of Apriori, the using of hash technology of it has effectively reduced the number of candidate k-itemsets especially 2itemsets, so this algorithm has obviously improved the performance of Apriori DHP algorithm Input r\(D TC  min_sup, large_num Output kk L,H k-itemsets After DHP algorithm mined initial document clustering then whole document collection D is formed by different document clusterings which are not relevance or have very few similar degree with each other, and every document clustering is formed by documents which are similar with each other D 1 DC  2 DC  x DC  d DC 1 x d x DC is the th x document clustering in D; d is total number

Cost of time of these three methods are show in Figure 2, it show that cost of time of these three methods are all rise with increase of number of documents in document collection, but cost of time of our new technique is fewer and its rise speed is slower than other two methods, there are the results of using DHP algorithm to min association rules and using term clustering to form document vector space model which are all reduce cost of time of clustering process  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This paper is supported by The Research Foundation of North China Institute of Aerospace Engineering \(ZKY-200906 R EFERENCES  1  Kosala R, lockeel H, ìWeb mining research: a surveyî, ACM SIGKDD Explorer Newslett[J  Vol 1 pp 1  15, 2000 2  LIU Li-ping, YI Hua-rong, ìA VSM-based Text Clustering Method Journal of Zhuzhou teachers college[J  in C h i n e se  V o l  9, p p  2 3  25 October 2004 3  KANG Tie-gang, DAI Ru-wei,ìA Novel Approach For Word Clustering Based On Large Tagged Corpusî, Journal of system simulation[J   in Chinese, Vol.15, pp.1439  1442, October 2003 4  J.

     The number of association rules is part of data utility, the correct number of association rules is also a key part of data utility So we introduce the following equation AR \(accuracy radio M / N where N is the number of association rules for original data and M is the number of common association rules for anonymous data Figure 6 is the accuracy radio of T40I10D100K. It shows that, when confident decreases, the accuracy radio increases Because our algorithm losses the information of unusual association rules while maintains the information of usual association rules D  Execution time Figure 7 is the time cost of T40I10D100K. It shows that our algorithm is very efficient, when the l value increases, the time cost will slightly increases because it costs a little more time to meet l diversity Figure 7  Time Cost of T40I10D100K VI  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we study the privacy issues in transaction data publication. Based on anatomy technique, we propose a new privacy model called multi-dimension anatomy that meets the privacy requirement of l diversity and suits to transaction data We introduce a simple linear-time anonymous algorithm Experiments show that our algorithm can safely and effectively protect privacy in transaction data There are still a number of promising areas for future work First, the linear-time algorithm proposed in this paper seems a little simple, some new heuristic algorithm needs to further research. Second, while an anatomized table has been generated, it remains an open problem on how to use the anonymized data A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this research by the NFS of Fujian Porvince under grants No 2009J01295, the NFS of Fujian Province under grants No 2010J01330 and scientific project of Fujian Provincial Department of Education under grants No. JA09004 R EFERENCES  1  K.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
