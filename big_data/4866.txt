The algorithm improves mining efficiency through these two methods. The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm is faster and more efficient than present algorithms when mining long frequent neighboring class set in large spatial data Keywords- spatial data mining; neighboring class set; top-down strategy; bit sequence; long frquent itemsets I   I NTRODUCTION  As we all know, geographic Information Databases is an

However, neighboring class set expresses another spatial association among these objects which are close to each other. MFNCS as in us e s t h e s i m i l a r m e t hod o f  Apriori to search frequent neighboring class set, which gains some right instance of \(k+1\-neighboring class set only through connecting right instance of k-neighboring class set according to down-top strategy, and so this algorithm is only suitable for mining short frequent neighboring class set according to character of Apriori. Hence, this paper introduces a top-down algorithm in frequent neighboring class sets mining, denoted by TDA, which is suitable for long frequent neighboring class 
set according to top-down strategy II  PRELIMINARY KNOWLEDGE  According to these representations as in [2   ev e r y ob ject in  spatial domain forms a spatial data set, which is expressed as this data structure, denoted by <Object Identify, Class Identify and Spatial Location>. Here, identify of different class in spatial data set is denoted by Class Identify, identify of different object instance in the same class is denoted by Object Identify, location coordinate of object is denoted by Spatial Location. We regard an object as an instance of corresponding class, and so spatial data set is made up of these instances of spatial Class Identify. Sets of Class Identify are thought as a class set, denoted by C = {C 1 C 2 C m means there are m different classes

Here, k-NCS  k+1\NCS B  Problem Description According to above definition, property and these representations as in [2 e de scr i b e freq ue nt ne i ghbor i ng class set mining as follows Input 1\lass set is denoted by C = {C 1 C 2 C m instance set is denoted by I = {i 1 i 2 i n each i k i k  I\s expressed as above defined data structure 2\Minimal distance is denoted by d 3\inimal support is denoted by s Output Frequent neighboring class set III  T HE TOP DOWN A LGORITHM  IN F REQUENT N EIGHBORING C LASS S ET M INING  A  Forming Digital NCS Database In order to form digital database of neighboring class set we need find corresponding NCS of every right instance, and turn NCS into a digit. The course of turning used by the algorithm is expressed as follows Step1, Firstly, we define the order of class as C = {C 1 C 2  C j C m Here j is defined as bit sequence, and so each class existing in right instance has bit sequence denoted by BS j  Step2, and then, we use an exponent to denote every class if bit sequence of this class is denoted by BS j and then this exponent is equal to 1 2  j BS  Step3, we will gain a digit by computing this value, denoted by    L j BS j 1 1 2 here L is equal to Neighboring Class Set Length and namely, it is the sum of class existing in this neighboring class set According to this method, the algorithm will gain a digit by scanning every right instance and this digit also denote this corresponding NCS of right instance Now we save these digits by this data structure expressed as follows Structure neighboring class set Int Digit; // saving digit expressed as NCS of right instance Int Count; // saving the sum of same digit expressed as NCS} NCS Example, here class set is expressed as C = {V, W, X, Y Z}, the first three right instances are express as I 1 W 2 X 4  Y 3 Z 1 I 2 V 1 W 5 Y 2 I 3 W 3 X 5 Y 4 Z 2  Now we use the previous introductive method to create digital NCS database, this course is expressed as follows NCS of I 1 is expressed as {W, X, Y, Z}, and the bit sequence is expressed as {2, 3, 4, 5}, and then digit = 2 2-1  2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 30, NCS [0 i gi t =30 N C S 0  C o unt 1  NCS of I 2 is expressed as {V, W, Y}, and the bit sequence is expressed as {1, 2, 4}, and then digit = 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 4-1  11, NCS Di gi t  1 1  N C S 1  C o unt 1  NCS of I 3 is expressed as {W, X, Y, Z}, and the bit sequence is expressed as {2, 3, 4, 5}, and then digit = 2 2-1  2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 30, because NCS [0  h a s a l r ead y  sa ve d this information, and only NCS[0 C o u n t=NCS  0   Co u n t 1=2 B  The method of generating candidate frequent NCS The algorithm generates candidate frequent neighboring class set according to top-down strategy. Namely, it uses digit logical operation to generate k-candidate frequent itemsets of digit form by \(k+1\digit non-frequent itemsets. The algorithm adopts search strategy which is similar to B_UDMA  as in [7  and ITDASN as in [8 h e co ur s e  o f  ge ner at i ng i s  e x p r e s s e d as follows Suppose here are three non-frequent neighboring class sets and two frequent neighboring class sets, their length are all equal to 4, and they may generate some candidate frequent neighboring class set, their length ought to be 3 Non-frequent neighboring class set 1\NCS 1 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 23 2\NCS 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 15 3\NCS 3 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 29 Frequent neighboring class set 1\S 1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 30 2\S 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 27 Generating candidate frequent neighboring class set No. 1 NFNCS 1 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 23, these subsets of non-frequent itemsets are expressed as follows C 1 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 7 C  2 1-1 2 2-1 2 5-1 19, which is deleted by FNCS 2  C 2 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 21 C  2 2-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 22, which is deleted by FNCS 1  No. 2 NFNCS 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 15, these subsets of non-frequent itemsets are expressed as follows C  2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 7. \(Duplication C  2 1-1 2 2-1 2 4-1 11, which is deleted by FNCS 2  C 3 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 13 


C  2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 14, which is deleted by FNCS 1  No. 3 NFNCS 3 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 29, these subsets of non-frequent itemsets are expressed as follows C  2 1-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 13. \(Duplication C  2 1-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 21. \(Duplication C  2 1-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 25, which is deleted by FNCS 2  C  2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 28, which is deleted by FNCS 1  C  The method of computing support Accordingly to chapter A and digit logical operation, we may gain this property as follows Property Let p and q express two right instances, let C p be a NCS denoted by p, let C q be a NCS denoted by q, then C p  C q  p & q=p This algorithm uses logical operation to compute support according to this property. The process is expressed as follows Suppose class set is expressed as C = {U, V, X, Y, Z there are 5 neighboring class sets as follows NCS 1 U, X, Y, Z NCS 2 V, X, Z NCS 3 U, V, X, Y, Z NCS 4 V, X, Y, Z NCS 5 X, Y, Z Their digits denoting neighboring class set of right instance are expressed as {29, 22, 31, 30 and 28}. Suppose a candidate is 20 which is denoted by C-NCS = {X, Z}, and then 29&20 20, 22&20=20, 31&20=20, 30&20=20, 28&20=20. Because of this, we write 5 to support \(C-NCS D  The process of mining frequen t neighboring class set Input 1\patial class set is denoted by C = {C 1 C 2  C m  2\ Instance set is denoted by I = {i 1 i 2  i n  3\The minimal distance is denoted by d 4\The minimal support is denoted by s Output: Frequent neighboring class set Step1: Firstly, the algorithm computes the entire right instances denoted by Iê from instance set in spatial database as I by the minimal distance as d Step2: And then, forming neighboring class set database as NCS after scanning once right instance set as Iê via the introductory method in chapter A of III Step3: Using top-down strategy to generate candidate frequent NCS according to this chapter B of III. Namely, if a kcandidate is frequent neighboring class set, and it is written to FNCS which saves frequent neighboring class set, otherwise the algorithm will compute \(k-1\subset of k-candidate, and then continue to search frequent neighboring class set Step4: Output FNCS according to chapter A of III IV  T HE A NALYSIS AND C OMPARING OF C APABILITY  At present, there are very little documents of research frequent neighboring class set. Here we compare MFNCS as with TDA which is introduced by this paper as follows A  The Analysis of Capability MFNCS: this algorithm uses idea of Apriori to find frequent neighboring class set, which is made of three stages firstly, computing all the frequent 1-NCS, secondly, generating all the 2-NCS by range query, and generating all the k-NCS k>2\by iteration. The algorithm has some repeated computing and superfluous candidate frequent neighboring class set which gains some right instance of \(k+1\-neighboring class set only through connecting right instance of k-neighboring class set. As this algorithm adopts down-top strategy to generate candidate frequent neighboring class set, it is only suitable for mining short frequent neighboring class set TDA: this algorithm adopts top-down strategy to generate candidate frequent neighboring class set, which is made of three stages, firstly, computing the 1 st m-candidate frequent neighboring class set which contains all classes, and then generating \(m-1\-candidate frequent neighboring class set, let m-1\ be k, and generating all \(k-1\-frequent neighboring class set \(k>3\ by iteration. But the algorithm is only suitable for mining long frequent neighboring class set for top-down strategy B  The comparing of experimental result Now we use experiment to testify above analyses and comparison. Two mining algorithms are used to generate frequent neighboring class set from 12267 right instances whose class sets are expressed as digit from 3 to 8191 neighboring class set does not include any simple class, namely it has two classes at least, the number of spatial class set is denoted by m=13, the number of right instance included by these neighboring class set observe the discipline which is expressed as follows NCS of digit denoted by 8191 has one right instance NCS of digit denoted by 8190 has two right instances NCS of digit denoted by 8189 has one right instance NCS of digit denoted by 8188 has two right instances  Our experimental circumstances are expressed as follow Intel\(R\ Celeron\(R\ M CPU 420 1.60 GHz, 1.24G, language of the procedure is Visual C# 2005.NET, OS is Windows XP Professional The experimental result of two algorithms is expressed as Fig.1, where support is absolute. The runtime of two algorithms is expressed as Fig.2 as support and length of neighboring class set change

This  rule has 100% confidence    In other words, it means if site  S 4   and  S 7  are selected to  work together to transfer the requested files, t h en this  implies site\(s  S 3  can also be selected to share the work at  the same time. This rule has confidence  100  This  particular rule has  confidence  of  100  meaning that  S 4  S 7   and  S 3  can be selected as a best set of replicas by  Replica  Manage r  to ge t  requested files. To compute the correlation  of this rule and see how far it is better than choosing the site  randomly, we use an Improvement equation     indicates that it has support of  26  transactions, meaning that in transaction  Single Trip  Time  Table  there are  2 6  concurrent uncongested trips of  S 4  S 7   i.e. these sites have similar network conditions in particular  time      indicates the total number of transactions  involving uncongested trips of  S 3   in  Rule 1  is equal to  174    This is a piece of a side information; it is not involved  in calculating the confidence or support for the rule itself       is the number of transactions where   S 4   S 7 as well as   S 3 has uncongested trips. In  Rule 1  it is equal  to  2 6       or   indicates how much  more likely we are to encounter  S 4  and  S 6  transaction if we  consider just those transactions where  S 3  S 5 and  S 8  have  uncongested trips. As compared to the entire population of  the transactions, it's t h e  confidenc e  divided by  support \(c   where the latter is expressed as a percentage   For  Rule 1 the  confidenc e is  100   support \(c  in  percentage   174/194\*100 = 89.6 9 So, th e    Lift ratio = 100/89.69.1 = 1.1   As it is clearly shown in  Figure 7  some r u les with  an improvement value less than one means this is an  unreliable rule. Whereas the rule with a value more than one  means this rule is better than random replica selection with  number of time equal to improvement value as it is shown in  Figure 8                   When improvement value is more than 1 it is better to use  EST to select replica sites, because it selects the sites able to  work simultaneously    I n  Figure  9  we sho w  the  comparison between EST and  traditional model using highest bandwidth a s  a criterion to  select the best replica. As we can observe our technique has  a better performance most of the times because it selects the  sites which have the stable links. In traditional method the  site which has the highest bandwidth does not always me a n  to be the best because sometimes this highest bandwidth  link can be congeste d   Let us declare more by the following  scenario  o f  Figure 1 0 suppose   S 0   be the computing site  and let   S 1  S 3   S 1 4   be replica sites  Red stars referring to  congested router s   Using traditional selection method the  file will be got from S14 since it has less number of Hops  routers\ and highest and also has highest bandwidth link         Figure 8.

               Using  ES T the replica   S 3    is selected as a best replica  because the link b etween  C S  and  R S  is uncongested     VII I   C ONCLUSIO N  In this paper we presented a dynamic replica  selection strategy that aims to adapt at ru n time its criteria to  flexible QoS binding contracts specified by the service  provider and/or the client. The adapta b ility feature  addressed by our replica selection strategy is inferred from  the observation that the basic metrics, which influence the  QoS that the user perceives when accessing a replica  depend directly on the application being replicated and on  the cli e nts\222 preferences. To reach this objective that, we  used   the concept of association rules of data mining  approach to the most stable links sites in order to reduce the  searching space the response time and network resources  consumed    A CKNOWLEDGEMENT S  Au t hors wish to express their sincere thanks to  Prof. Arun Agarwal, from GridLabs Department of  Computer and Information Sciences, University of  Hyderabad, India for providing all the infrastructural and  computational support required to carry out this work  His  academic suggestions to improve the quality of the work are  also highly appreciated and acknowledged   R EFERENCE S     M  Rashedur Rahma n   Ken Barke r   Reda Alhaj j    Replica  selection in grid environment:a dat a mining approac h    Distributed systems and grid computing \(DSGC\,pp: 695  226  700  2005    J.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
