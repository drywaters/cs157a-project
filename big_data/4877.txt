However, hiding multi-relational association rule in data warehouses is not yet investigated This work presents a novel algorithm to hide predictive association rules on multiple tables.  Given a target predictive item, a technique is proposed to hide multi-relational association rules containing the target item without joining the multiple tables.  Examples and analyses are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach Keywords- association rule; privacy preserving; hiding multi-relational; data mining I I NTRODUCTION Recent studies in preserving association rule privacy have proposed many techniques [5,8,12  F o r ex a m pl e   in association rule mining outsourcing, encoding/decoding schemes are developed to transform data and ship it to a third party service provider \(server\he data owner sends mining queries to the server and recovers the true patterns from the extracted patterns received from the server.  The data mining privacy is protected as the server does not learn any sensitive information from the data.  In privacypreserving data mining, perturbation, and anonymization techniques have been developed to hide the association rules from been discovered form published data In particular, for a single data set, given specific rules or patterns to be hidden, many data altering techniques for hiding association rules have been proposed.  They can be categorized into three basic approaches.  The first approach 3,13 i des on e ru le at a ti m e It f i rs t s e lects trans actions  that contain the items in a give rule.  It then tries to modify items, transaction by transaction, until the confidence or support of the rule falls below minimum confidence or minimum support.  The modification is done by either removing items from the transaction or inserting new items to the transactions.  The second approach deals with groups of restricted patterns or sensitive association rules at a time  It f i rs t s e lects t h e t r an s actions t h at con ta in t h e  intersecting patterns of a group of restricted patterns Depending on the disclosure threshold given by users, it sanitizes a percentage of the selected transactions in order to hide the restricted patterns.  The third approach [14,15  deals with hiding certain constrained classes of association rules.  Once the proposed hiding items are given, the approach integrates the rule selection process into the hiding process.  It hides one rule at a time by calculating the number of transactions required to sanitize and modify them accordingly However, in real life, a database is typically made up of multiple tables.  For example, there are multiple dimension tables and a fact table in a star schema in a data warehouse Although efficient mining techniques have been proposed to discover frequent itemsets and multi-relational association rules from multiple tables [4,6,7 9,10 f e w  w o rks h a v e  concentrated on hiding sensitive association rules on multirelational databases.  In this work, we present a novel algorithm for hiding sensitive predictive association rules in data warehouses with star schema.  Based on the strategies of no joining of multiple tables and effective reduction of confidence of association rule, the proposed algorithm can effectively hide multi-relational association rules.  Examples and analyses are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 presents the statement of the problem.  Section 3 presents the proposed algorithm for hiding sensitive association rules from multiple tables.  Section 4 shows an example of the proposed approach.  Section 5 shows the complexity of the proposed algorithm and compares it with joining table approach.   Concluding remarks and future works are described in section 6 II P ROBLEM D ESCRIPTION Association rule mining was first introduced in [1,2 e t  I={i 1 i 2 i m  be a set of literals, called items.

mining association rules is to find all rules that are greater than the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence As an example, for a given database with six transactions shown in Figure 1, a minimum support of 33% and a minimum confidence of 70%, nine association rules can be found as follows B  A 66%, 100 C  A 66%, 100 B  C 50%, 75 C  B 50%, 75 AB  C 50%, 75 AC  B 50%, 75 BC  A 50%, 100 C  AB 50 75 B  AC 50%, 75%\, where the percentages inside the parentheses are supports and confidences respectively TID Items  T 1 ABC T 2 ABC T 3 ABC T 4 AB T 5 A T 6 AC Figure 1.  A sample dataset The objective of data mining is to extract hidden or potentially unknown but interesting rules or patterns from databases.  However, the objective of privacy preserving data mining is to hide certain sensitive information so that they cannot be discovered through data mining techniques 3,11,13-15  For a s s o c i at i o n r u l e  hi d i ng  gi ve n a transaction database D a minimum support, a minimum confidence and a set of sensitive association rules X the objective is to minimally modify the database D such that no association rules in X will be discovered Continue from previous example with minimum support 33%, minimum confidence 70%, and a sensitive association rule C=>B if transaction T 1 is modified from ABC to AC then the rule C  B 33%, 50%\ will be hidden However, rules B  C 33%, 66 AB  C 33%, 66 B  AC 33%, 66 AC  B 33%, 50 C  AB 33 50%\,will be lost as side effects The techniques in association rule mining has been extended to work on numerical data, categorical data, and others in more conventional databases.  In a relational database, a set of relational tables may exist.  A star schema in a data warehouse is typical made up of multiple dimension tables and a fact table.  Consider the following star schema w i t h  f act ta ble ATMactivity\(acct#, atm amount and two dimension tables Customer\(acct balance, zipcode, age and ATM\(atm#, type, zipcode, limit  as shown in Figure 2.  If limited to single table, the association rule mining algorithms on transaction data can be easily extended and discover rules such as age\(20..29 balance\(1000..1999 from table Customer and type\(in limit\(10000..19999 from table ATM for each individual table.  However, to discover cross table association rules such as limit\(0..9999\ => balance\(1000..1999  limit\(0..9999\ =>age\(20..29 all three tables must be joined.  The significant redundancy in such a joined table would seriously degrade the performance of multi-relational association rule mining.  To efficiently discover frequent itemsets and association rules across multiple tables, many techniques have been proposed [4,6,7,9,10   In this work, we consider the problem of efficiently hiding predictive association rules on multiple tables in star schema.  Given a predictive item, a predictive association rule set is the minimal set of association rules that can make the same prediction as all association rules.  For example given predictive item balance\(1000..1999 with min_supp 0.4 and min_conf=0.6, the predictive association rule set contains two rules age\(20..29\ => balance\(1000..1999  limit\(0..9999\ => balance\(1000..1999 Even though there may be other rules that contain balance\(1000..1999 on the right hand side More specifically, given a fact table and a set of dimension tables in a star schema, a minimum support, a minimum confidence, and a predictive item, the objective is to minimally modify the dimension tables such that no predictive association rules will be discovered.  For example, given the three tables in Figure 2, minimum support = 0.4, minimum confidence = 0.6, and predictive item balance\(1000..1999 if balance\(1000..1999 from acct#01 and acct#03 in Customer table are deleted \(or suppressed\e two predictive association rules will be hidden Customer Table acct balance zipcode age 01 1000..1999 10023 20..29 02 1000..1999 10047 20..29 03 1000..1999 10035 20..29 04 2000..5000 10035 30..39 05 2000..5000 10023 30..39 06 1000..1999 10047 30..39 ATMactivity Table acct# atm amount 01 A 15..25 01 A 15..25 02 A 15..25 02 C 50..100 02 C 50..100 03 A 15..25 03 B 15..25 04 B 50..100 04 E 500..1000 05 A 15..25 05 A 15..25 05 D 50..100 06 C 50..100 06 F 500..1000 ATM Table atm type zipcode limit A drive 10023 0..9999 B out 10035 0..9999 C out 10047 0..9999 D in 10023 10000..19999 E in 10035 10000..19999 F in 10047 10000..19999 Figure 2.  Fact table and dimension tables in a star schema III P ROPOSED A LGORITHM To hide an association rule efficiently on multiple tables two issues must be addressed. The first issue is how to calculate supports of itemsets efficiently and the second issue is how to reduce the confidence of an association rule by minimal modification of dimension tables To calculate the support of an itemset, one trivial approach is to join all tables together and calculate the supports using any frequent itemset mining algorithm such as Apriori algorithm for transaction data.  We assume that quantitative attribute values \(e.g. age and monetary amounts are partitioned and treated as items.  It is obvious that 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 1299 


joining all tables will increase in size many folds.  In large applications, the joining of all related tables cannot be realistically computed because of the many-to-many relationship blow up and large dimensionality.  In addition increase in both size and dimensionality presents a huge overhead to already expensive frequent itemset mining even if the join can be computed Instead of joining-then-mining we will adopt miningthen-joining approach in this work To reduce the confidence of an association rule X=>Y with minimal modification, the strategy in the support-based and confidence-based distortion schemes is to either decrease its supports X  N or X  Y  N maller than pre-specified minimum support or decrease its confidence  X  Y  X to be smaller than pre-specified minimum confidence To decrease the confidence of a rule, two strategies can be considered.  The first strategy is to increase the support count of X i.e., the left hand side of the rule, but not support count of X  Y The second strategy is to decrease the support count of the itemset X  Y For the second strategy there are in fact two options.  One option is to lower the support count of the itemset X  Y so that it is smaller than pre-defined minimum support count.   The other option is to lower the support count of the itemset X  Y so that X  Y  X is smaller than pre-defined minimum confidence.  In addition, in the record containing both X and Y if we decrease the support of Y only, it would reduce the confidence faster than reducing the support of X In fact, we can pre-calculate the number of records required to hide the rule.  If there is not enough record to lower the confidence of the rule, then the rule cannot be hidden.  To decrease support count of an item, we will remove one item at a time in the selected record by deleting it or suppressing it replaced by *\.  In this work, we will adopt the second strategy for the proposed algorithm In order to hide predictive association rules, we will consider hiding association rules with 2 items x=>z where z is a predictive item and x is a single large one item.  In theory, predictive association rules may have more specific rules that contain more items, e.g xY => z where Y is a large itemset.   However, for such rule to exist, its confidence must be greater than the confidence of x=>z  i.e conf\(xY=>z\ > conf\(x=>z or xYz| > conf\(x=>z xY For higher confidence rules, such as conf\(x=>z\ = 1  there will be no more specific rules.  In addition, once the more general rule is hidden, the more specific rule might be hidden as well Algorithm HPAR Input  1\act table FT and a set of dimension tables DT 1  DT 2  2\inimum support \(min_supp 3\inimum confidence \(min_conf 4\et of hidden items Y Output fact table and a transformed set of dimension tables where the predictive association rules containing Y on the RHS are hidden  1 Find all frequent 1-itemsets; //scan FT build vector v t for each FK and TID lists for each item 2 For each frequent target item y in Y 2.1 Find all in-table frequent 2-itemsets containing target item y; //use TID list 2.2 Find all cross-table frequent 2-itemsets containing target item y scan FT and build vector ct 2.3 Calculate the confidences of all predictive association rules x=>y  Conf\(x=>y min_conf 2.4 Sort the PARs in descending order of confidence 2.5 Repeat 2.5.1 Get the first PA R  2.5.2 Calculate the number of records iterNum needs to be modified; // for confidence to be smaller than min_conf or support to be smaller than min_supp  2.5.3 Find the TIDs containing target item with sum of v t counts iterNum  2.5.4 Delete the target item in the TIDs  2.5.5 Update the confidences of PARs  2.5.6 Sort the PARs in descending order 2.6 Until \(no more PA R  The HPAR algorithm first tries to find all frequent 1itemsets from one scan of fact table by building a vector v t to record the support counts for the primary key values of dimension tables.  It also records the TID list for each 1itemset.  It then tries to find all frequent 2-itemsets by scanning the fact table to calculate the support counts for cross-table itemsets.  The in-table 2-itemsets can be calculated by performing intersection on TID lists in the same dimension table.  To hide a predictive association rule the algorithm calculates the number of records required to be modified and perform deletion \(or suppression\.  It repeats the same process after modification and update until no more predictive association exists IV E XAMPLE This section shows an example to demonstrate the proposed algorithm in hiding predictive association rules from multiple tables of star schema Given dimension tables Customer  ATM fact table ATMactivity with min_support = 0.4, min_conf=0.6, and hidden item balance\(1000..1999 the execution of the proposed algorithm is shown as follows Step 1 Scan fact table to build v t for each FK acct and atm and build TID lists for each 1-itemset in dimension tables T ABLE 1 V ECTOR V C USTOMER acct# 01 02 03 04 05 06  count 2 3 2 2 3 2 1300 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications

From the TID list of 1-itemset balance\(1000..1999 we find acct#01, acct#3 both appear twice in fact table.  This is the minimal number of target item we can delete in order to hide the specified rule.  Therefore we delete balance\(1000..1999 from acct#01 and acct#3 in the dimension table DT 1 The confidence of rule becomes 3/7  0.43 and is therefore hidden.  In addition, the updated confidence of the rule limit\(0..9999 balance\(1000..1999 becomes 4/11  0.36 and is also hidden The algorithm stops as both predictive association rules are hidden after deleting balance\(1000..1999 form acct#1 and acct#3 from dimension table Customer  V A NALYSIS In this section, we provide complexity analyses on the proposed algorithm and compare it with joining-then-mining approach Instead of calculating and hiding predictive association rules on the joined table formed by fact table and all dimension tables, the proposed algorithm find the association rules in two phases similar to [7 i rs t calculates all 1-itemsets by one scan of fact table.  It then calculates all 2-itemsets, both in-table and cross-table, by another scan of fact table, without performing join operation and materialize the join.  For each predictive association rule, it calculates the number of records that need to be modified.  The process is repeated after modification and update until all rules are hidden.  We first provide the calculation of number of modification required and then estimate the operation on itemsets required to hide the predictive association rules Lemma 1 For a predictive association rule  y  y  Y algorithm HPAR performs min  FT|*\(supp\(xy\ - min_conf supp\(x  FT|*\(supp\(xy\ - min_supp odifications to hide the rule Proof Line 2.5.2 calculates the number of records that needs to be modified so that the confidence of a given rule is either smaller than min_conf or support to be smaller than min_supp Let the confidence of a predictive association rule be xy|/|x and greater than min_conf The support count of xy is decreased by one when one transaction containing xy is modified to support x only.  Assuming it takes k 1 executions to reduce the confidence to be less than min_conf, i.e xy| Ö k 1 x min_conf.  This inequality can be rewritten as k 1  xy| - min_conf *|x  FT|*\(supp\(xy\ - min_conf * supp\(x Assuming it takes k 2 executions to reduce the support to be less than min_supp  i.e xy| Ö k 2 FT  min_supp This inequality can be rewritten as k 2  xy| - min_supp *|FT  FT|*\(supp\(xy min_supp Therefore, it would take min\(k 1 k 2  modifications to hide the rule, since either the confidence is less than the min_conf or the support is less than min_supp  T ABLE 2 V ECTOR V ATM atm A B C D E F count 6 2 3 1 1 1 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 1301 


Lemma 2 The time complexity of HPAR algorithm is O\(|FT| + |Y|*\(|FT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 where FT is the number of records in fact table Y is the number of items in Y and l 2 is the maximum number of frequent 2-itemsets Proof The time complexity estimated here is based on the number of operations required on itemsets.  To find all frequent 1-itemsets in line one, it takes O\(|FT operations On line two, there are at most Y number of frequent target items.  For each of these items, the following operations are executed.  To find frequent 2-itemsets, it is line 2.2 that calculating cross-table itemsets will require most operations It takes O\(|FT operations to scan the fact table again Assuming the maximum number of frequent 2-itemset is l 2  step 2.4 and step 2.5.6 perform sorting of these frequent 2itemsets repeatedly.  It would require O l 2 2 logl 2 2 operations  In total, the estimated operation is O\(|FT Y|*\(|FT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 For joining-then-mining approach, a straight forward calculation of predictive association rule is to join the fact table with all dimension tables and then perform Apriori algorithm.  Let JT = FT DT 1  DT n be the joined table.  If we apply same strategy to reduce the confidence of an association rule, then time complexity can be estimated similarly Lemma 3 The time complexity of joining-then-hiding approach is O\(|JT| + |Y|*\(|JT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 where JT is the number of records in fact table Y is the number of items in Y and l 2 is the maximum number of frequent 2itemsets Proof The proof is similar to lemma 2 It can be observed that the joined table JT is much bigger than the fact table FT as JT contains attributes from all dimension tables.  The operations on joined table will be much more than operations on fact table along.  In addition the cost of joining and memory space to save the joined table must be considered VI C ONCLUSION In this work, we have studied the problem of hiding sets of predictive association rules on multiple tables of star schema.  We propose a novel technique addressing two issues Ö efficient calculation of itemsets and reduction of rule confidence. Examples illustrating the proposed approach are shown.  Analyses are given and compared to joined table approach.  Currently we have implemented the proposed technique on single table and experimenting on multiple tables.  We will continue to examine and improve the various side effects of the proposed approach.  We will also consider utilizing better data structures to reduce database scanning for better efficiency A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by the National Science Council, Taiwan, under grant NSC-98-2221-E-390-030 R EFERENCES 1 R.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
