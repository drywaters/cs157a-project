For example, the concept C 6 is in two different orders as shown in Table II and Table III. The weighing schema considered the concept C 6 an important concept although it o ccurred only one time in all documents 2\he second effect of the fuzzy weighting schema is the appearing of new concepts with high fuzzy weighted values in the top of the list For example, in Table II the concept C 5 does not satisfy the threshold weight value although C 5 occurred 5 times in D4 In contrast in Table III the concept C 5 has a high fuzzy weighted value and exists in the top of the table C. Association Rule Mining \(ARM\ Phase The D-EART system designed to extract association rules base d o n concepts by using a new GARC algorithm. The algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by employing the power of data structure called Hash Table The hashing function h v oncepts number N  considered the key factors in hash table building and search performance. The GARC algorithm is utilized with dynamic hash table 1\ Generating Association Rules Algorithm Based on Concepts \(GARC  The proposed GARC algorithm as in Fig 5 employs the following two main steps: \(1\the number of concepts N ents, a dictionary table was constructed as shown in Table IV for N 6 concepts, and 2\There are also two main processes for a dynamic hash table: the building process, and the scanning process.

The number of concepts N 30 resulted from the indexing process a nd used for building a dynamic hash table. Fig. 6 shows the number of all fuzzy weighted concepts that labeling each document. Fig. 7 shows the number of the resultant association rules with c 50% which is equal to 64 rules The D-EART system can do different queries on the extracted asso ciation rules. The query s upports the medical researchers by a model of important relationships within the concept features. This model might identify relations between the disease and the suitable treatments, and relations between a treatment and its side effects. Fig. 8 shows the query screen which includes both the categories information and the queries result icons. The user can dete rmine which the categories will get the relations between them. The query results can be saved on the hard disk thro ugh the export icon  Fig.6 The number of fuzzy weighted concepts  Fig. 7 The resultant rules that satisfy c 50  Fig. 8 Query Screen The advantages of D-EART system are as follows 1 The user can access XML textual documents online 2  The design of the D-EART system is based on concept represe ntation and considers the synonymy as a characteristic of the natural language characteristics 3 It is flexible to work on specific or all parts of the documents with the same structure. Moreover it is not fully domain-independent so we can apply it on other domains 4 The proposed GARC algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of the previous algorithms 5 It extracts three types of the associ ation rules depending on the analysis of relations between the concepts only words only and concepts with words. In addition different queries are available on the extracted association rules IV  E XPERIMENTAL  R ESULTS The experiments are performed to compare the p e rformance of both D-EART system and Apriori-concept system for the number of extracted association rules and the execution time. Finally, evalu ate the performance of D-EART system at the three semantic levels: concepts only, words 


only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
