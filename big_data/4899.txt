A novel GEP-based algorithm for mining multiple-layers association rules was presented. Firstly, takes generalizing technology as a way to value fitness function in GEP \(Gene Expression Programming\en, relying on the significant self-search 
function of GEP, the most optional species was evolved. The frequent items and association rules in the next deeper layers can be mined by using traditional support-confidence method in sub-database. The algorithm improves on the frame of traditional association rule mining and uses a new evolutionary algorithm for mining association rules. Finally, the validity and efficiency of the method are presented by the application in the paper Keywords

The literature [3  p r o p o s e d  some algorithms and recommendation system from mining frequent association rules. In recent years, the evolutionary algorithm is used for mining association rules, which becomes hot topic. The literature [5 i scu ssed h o w to ap p l y  genetic algorithm to the process of mining association rules in a large database. The literature [6 r o p o s ed h o w to u s e  PAGEP \(mining Predicate Asso ciation by GEP\ algorithm 
for mining generalized association rules. These methods can solve for mining association rules in the same layer in the WUM of multilevel association rule, but the capabilities for mining association rules between layers in multi-layer association rules seem inadequa te. This is because of: \(1 the above methods encode simply with a single character encoding to the items, but not address code of the item in different layers and not make coding a good explanation. \(2 Some of the above algorithms generate any individual by 
scanning database, so a large time and space overhead. The literatu ed th at y o u can tap i n to t h e f r equ e nt item-sets after the abstract by generalizing a large transaction databases. After getting a sufficient degree if abstraction to support frequent items, the GEP-based multiple-layers association rule mining algorithm, which is used to split the database and find out the common characteristics in sub -database, and then mining the lower frequent item-sets.

more optimum individual and then scan sub-database which greatly reduce the time and space overhead and improve the capacity of mining association rules between layers ii  Related works A  The multiple-level association rule mining  Association rules, also known as association models association rule mining found an interesting correlation or related relationship between item-sets in large data. Mining algorithms first is put forward and research by the Agrawal the pruning algorithm based on frequent item-sets is put forward by Agrawal et , which is divided into two stages first , identify all the frequent item-sets, and then frequent item-sets generated the strong association rules, these rules must satisfy the minimum support S \(support\ and minimum confidence C\(confidence\ning association rules problem is generated over S and C were given by the user's minimum support and minimum confidence of association rules that is to produce strong rules. However, for many applications, the strong association rules between data items in the lower or the original abstraction layer is difficult to find. Mining association rules between multiple layers have enough sufficient flexibility is an important area of data mining Data. Association rules mining in a number of layers called multi-level association rules [7 ltile v e l as so ciatio n ru le s in accordance with the rules involved level can be divided into the same level association rules and association rules between layers. At present, the mining of multilevel association rules basically follow the "support - confidence framework and concentrated on the same layer associated mining, this mining association rules method apply to the mining between layers, capacity of what is clearly insufficient. This method in the paper can improve the traditional multi-level association rule mining framework  B  Based on the abstract generalization frequent item-sets mining  Definition 1 Abstract Frequency Items, AFItems\ The items in the item-sets of the library is a database property value, property value in data processing can be carried out along dimension for the generalization, after a generalization to the top, the top-level item-sets is frequent and we call these frequent item-sets of the top to AFItems  This step of generalization, with such as DB2, SQL Server and other database tools, can be most easily completed in the algorithm, we say that this step is generalizing \(TS\. The experiment in this paper Uses Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services deal with the generalization process. Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services provide the tools that analysis data warehouse and data mart stored data, SQL Server 2005 Data Transformation Services \(DTS\s a Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services for developing components, data conversion services support to extract data from a data source, and carry out complex data conversion from time to time and store conversion of data have been summarized in another data source. It can generalize and aggregate in multiple dimensions of database    Generalization play an important role in the complex database, usually indiscriminate mining in large databases could lead to a large number of "rules", but actually the number of rules are not interested in a particular user, if there is a clear depicts before the excavation, it is said that we hope that the abstract frequent item-sets, they can cover most of the transaction. The benefits of which is: develop the road map in the macro and provide the basis for a large search space, reduce blindness of searcher, at the same , the lower frequent item-sets that is not belong the abstract frequent item sets will be pruned off, this would be similar to the Agrawalís pruning algorithm based on frequent item-sets iii   Algorithms for mining multilevel association rules  A   The fitness measure function  The fitness value of GEP is used to measure each individual of populations in the optimization calculation which may meet or help to find the fine level of the optimal solution.

If the number of generation of traditional genetic algorithm is N, then the scanning frequency number of the MAGGEP algorithm is the algorithm in the literature [9 N in scan n i n g  sub-database .Comparing the MAGGEP algorithm with the classical pruning algorithm, the scanning frequency and the number of transactions of the database reduce greatly.

A larger web site can tap into a deeper layer. For understanding easily, the experiment taps to the third level only as a simple example Through mongering and squashing similar transactions, then setting the value of S and C, We can easily tap into a 2  Admissions Employment\\ academic departments Remote   Support = 60%, Confident = 67.5   2 This abstract frequent item-set illustrates that during this period external users access Admissions Employment and academic departments frequently under the home page  A  Main parameters of GEP  000  Multiple genes encoding of GEP each gene is called as a one-dimensional array of constant length, a gene represents an item, the two- dimensional array of fixed length form each chromosome, and the whole two-dimensional array represents a transaction.
