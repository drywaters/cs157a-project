execution from one system to another system in a massive network Mobile agent interact s with static agents and other resources to perform its task autonomously Mobile agents are particularly attractive in distributed information retrieval applications This paper discusses about how to parallelize the incremental algorithm for mining distr ibuted dynamic datasets This minimizes communication overhead between distributed systems and the central system. In this distributed approach, we use static agents at each distributed local system which are capable of generating local model each static agent has a summary of its own database as well as the global model  carries the summary of the entire data base\ of the frequent item 
sets This ability permits our system to generate high contrast frequent item sets which allow us to examine how the d ata is positioned over different systems Using the capabilities of the mobile agent the knowledge could be retrieved from the local systems to the central system for making the communication process better and easier between the distributed systems   I   I NTRODUCTION  Analysis of past transaction data provide very valuable information for the decision making purpose  T h e  problem of extracting knowledge is a difficult task for large datasets due to their static nature and geographical 
distribution dat asets   D ue  t o  t h e s e  pr o pe rt i e s   a l go r i t h m s  that handle large datasets cannot assume or control the partitioned structure, the sizes, and the location of the pieces of the datasets and must take account of the latencies and bandwidth required to move da ta among the places  Mobile agent is a composition of software and data which can move from one system to another system autonomously in a distributed network These programs are capable of suspending their execution on one platform and moving to another platform where they resume execution Mobile  methods to handle the distributed data and hence distributed 
data mining   In this paper we have focused to increase the performance of existing alg orithm by inducing parallel computing with the help of co operative mobile and static agents. Here the static agent computes with the data in the local host automatically whenever it detects a change Static agents do not move around the distributed databa ses but use embedded  knowledge to assist in filtering and processing the volume of data Later the mobile agent interacts and retrieves required data from the static agents that are residing in the local systems   II  M OTIVATIONS AND RELATED WORK  
A co mmon approach for mining distributed data systems is the centralized one in which all data is moved to a single central location and then mined. Another approach is the local one where models are built locally at each site and then moved to a common loc ation where they are combined  The later approach is the quickest but often least accurate while the former approach is more accurate but generally quite expensive in terms of time required  These existing approaches for Distributed Data Mining suffer  from one or more of the following disadvantages   Lack of coordination among the distributed sites 
while generating the local knowledge, affects the quality of global knowledge   Non flexibility in addition of new algorithm to its knowledge base   Capa bility to dynamically discover data sites based on user requirements   Network overhead communication overhead and time overhead  In our proposed work with the use of the co operative agents we are trying to minimize the above flaws prevailing in the ex isting works  III P ROPOSED WORK  To improve the accuracy of the knowledge obtained from 
the local model, strong association rules between the item sets are established The decisions are derived based on the association rules Static agents residing in the  local system compute the local models and are brought to the central system for combining them to generate global model at the central system based on which global knowledge is mined  Knowledge from distributed sites is extracted in the form of associati on rules Based on the types of values the association rules can be classified into two categories

Mobile agents are directed towards the distributed system s with the static agents and pass the query  The static agents then process the query to generate LFIi accordingly The calculated LFIi is then sent to the neighboring systems and to the central system Based on the received LFIi the central system calcul ates GFI and CGFI based on the  Minsup    Fig.1 Finding Final GFT using Static and Mobile  agents    Fig.2: Data mining in Distributed Communication Systems   


 110   Now the infrequent item sets are analyzed and a PGFI count is computed by static agents and sent to the central system With the PGFI count the central site calculates the final GFI which is then updated in the glob al knowledge. This makes the process of decision making more efficient In this analysis we have utilized the features of the JADE mobile agent  I V  A PPLICAION IN ROBITICS  The decision making process makes the system to take a decision by learning fro m distributed datasets For this association rule mining with supervised learning technique is used for machine learning by creating a function from training data The global knowledge will be useful for the central system to effectively control the distri buted systems with effective communication using the agents Robotics which are based on distributed datasets can effectively implement this proposed algorithm to make decision making easier  V C ONCLUSION  In  this paper we have focused the problems of m ining frequent item sets on dynamic and distributed data sets in different parallel and distributed systems using mobile and static agents We proposed an approach to minimize the response time and increase the accuracy of knowledge mining for the global s et of frequent item sets, as well as to find frequent item patterns in infrequent item sets  In the future work the concept of static agents can be replaced by indexing techniques and can be applied in areas like robotics, unmanned vehicles etc to make th e communication process between the distributed systems in an effective way  R EFE R ENCE S   1  U  P Kulkarni P.D.Dessai Tanveer Ahmed J.V.Vadavi A.R.Yardi  Conference on Computational Intelligen ce and Multimedia Applications 2007   2  Matthew Eric Otey Srinivasan Parthasarathy member IEEE Chao  Parallel and Distributed Methods for Incremental Frequent Intem set  Mining  transactions on systems, m an and cybernetics  Vol 34, No.6 December 2004  3  Yun Lan Wang Zeng Zhi Li Hai   Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybern etics, Wan, 2 5 November 2003  4    th  International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium   5  Wu Sh an Jijang Ji  Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning  Cybernetics, Guangzhou, 18 21 August 2005  6   approach for Relia ble Mobile Agent in Information Retrieval  Control and Telecommunication Technologies, 2009 IEEE  7     September 2003  8  Raqu    9    Based  58113 683 8/03/0007  10     2010 IJRIC & LLS, ISSN 2076 3328   Fig.3: Agent Initialization    Fig.4.

The DOCINER approach suggests such indexation rules by using an FCA system V  E VALUATION Our evaluation relies on classic precision and recall measures \(possibly combined in a F-measure\sess the 2\ and \(3 used to calculate the values of precision, recall and Fmeasur  3    2  2   1  recall precision recall precision measure F trd ard recall ad ard precision 000\016 000 000\020 000 000 Where  ard  = number of relevant documents in the result list  trd   = total number of relevant documents in the document base  ad   = number of documents in the result list Values of precision, recall and F-measure are calculated by comparing the keywords in the result lists with keywords identified by an expert TABLE 2 shows the average results for 30 example documents. The method is tested in two steps, finding keywords and indexing concepts TABLE 2 E VALUATION OF THE K EYWORD AND C ONCEPT E XTRACTION M ETHOD Steps of evaluation Precision Recall F-measure  Finding keywords 0.9933 0.9900 0.9861 Indexing concepts with indexing rules 1.0 0.9900 0.9945 As regards the precision values of finding concepts and indexing concepts, the precision value is increased in the process of indexing concepts. Af ter identifying the concepts by using indexing rules, non-relevant keywords to such concepts are removed. However, the proposed method is only a prototype. It needs to be developed for an application in the future VI  C ONCLUSION We have presented a document indexation approach This approach can help users to associate documents or educational resources to concepts \(terms referring to domains or topics\y using the occurrence of keywords in such documents in order that those documents can be retrieved by using the concepts. The advantage of this method is the suggestion of indexation rules to the user by implementing them in a way of knowledge management systems. The use of indexation rules help to remove non relevant keywords. The limit of this method is that concepts cannot be identified if there are no relevant words related to such concepts We shall evaluate our method by comparing our results with other concept/rule identification tools. To that end we shall re-use similarity measures between concepts and between keywords by using the well-known formula of similarity measures which is Jaccard’s coefficient as described in  R EFERENCES 1  Caw s C F r ie s e n, N   Be audo i n M  A N e w  L e ar ning O b je c t  Repository for Language Learning: Methods and Possible Outcomes Editor: Alex Koohang.

The number of concepts N 30 resulted from the indexing process a nd used for building a dynamic hash table. Fig. 6 shows the number of all fuzzy weighted concepts that labeling each document. Fig. 7 shows the number of the resultant association rules with c 50% which is equal to 64 rules The D-EART system can do different queries on the extracted asso ciation rules. The query s upports the medical researchers by a model of important relationships within the concept features. This model might identify relations between the disease and the suitable treatments, and relations between a treatment and its side effects. Fig. 8 shows the query screen which includes both the categories information and the queries result icons. The user can dete rmine which the categories will get the relations between them. The query results can be saved on the hard disk thro ugh the export icon  Fig.6 The number of fuzzy weighted concepts  Fig. 7 The resultant rules that satisfy c 50  Fig. 8 Query Screen The advantages of D-EART system are as follows 1 The user can access XML textual documents online 2  The design of the D-EART system is based on concept represe ntation and considers the synonymy as a characteristic of the natural language characteristics 3 It is flexible to work on specific or all parts of the documents with the same structure. Moreover it is not fully domain-independent so we can apply it on other domains 4 The proposed GARC algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of the previous algorithms 5 It extracts three types of the associ ation rules depending on the analysis of relations between the concepts only words only and concepts with words. In addition different queries are available on the extracted association rules IV  E XPERIMENTAL  R ESULTS The experiments are performed to compare the p e rformance of both D-EART system and Apriori-concept system for the number of extracted association rules and the execution time. Finally, evalu ate the performance of D-EART system at the three semantic levels: concepts only, words 


only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
