Ontology-based Association Rule Quality Evaluation Using Information Theory  Xia Shi Xiong School of Computer Science and Technology China University of Mining and Technology Xuzhou Jiangsu China  Li Fan School of Computer Science and Technology China University of Mining and Technology Xuzhou Jiangsu China lifan51777@cumt.edu.cn Zhang Lei School of Computer Science and Technology China University of Mining and Technology Xuzhou Jiangsu China  Abstract Support and confidence are two main parameters of association rule mining, the first is used to measure the statistics importance of association rule, and the second is used 
to measure the reliability of association rule. The quality of association rule does not have quantitative evaluation criterion In this paper, Quality index is proposed, the subjective and objective aspects are integrated and information theory is introduced in order to evaluate multi-level association rule’s quality based on domain ontology. The quality index of rule can be an important reference in redundancy treatment and rule application. Finally, the experiment shows one of the applications of quality index in multi-level association rule mining and redundancy treatment ontology-based Keywords- multi-level association rule; ontology; rule quality evaluation; quality index I  I NTRODUCTION  There are numbers of strong association rules that meet the minimum support and minimum confidence extracted 
which makes the analysis and application of these rules become very difficult. And also some rule’s quality is serious: a large number of rules are not the user’s needs; in practice, some rules are redundant or overlap and even inconsistent with the actual situation; also some rules are too general or too detail that does not meet the requirement. A new framework is proposed in  w h i c h co m b i n e s fi el d knowledge with association rule mining, grouping and pruning rules. The framework builds a schema of domain knowledge combining with the goals and knowledge of user which is contained in database, then prunes and filters rules based on rule schema. Reference [2 in teg r a t es sem a n tic web, divides rule set into five categories: trivial, known and correct, unknown and correct, known and incorrect 
unknown and incorrect, prunes meaningless and useless rules for user through semantic analysis  Reference [3 o n s id ers  that lots of redundant and overlap rules are produced during association rule mining because of the sparseness of largescale high dimensional data  A method using meta-rules to divide rules with the same result into separate groups is proposed, and then pruning the rule set using meta-rules, the article also mention that domain knowledge can be used to prune each rule group. The quality of association rules should be considered as an important issue  Reference  propose a new method to evaluate rule quality, a weight based on domain knowledge assigned to each property of hierarchy concept is needed, the method combines the 
subjective and objective evaluation method, and the result can reflect user's interest very well There are objective and subjective methods for rule quality evaluation. Objective method is based on statistical or machine learning and so on; Subjective evaluation method integrates user participation and domain knowledge. The objective can not express domain knowledge; Association rule mining and quality evaluation solely based on data have much shortage in application. User's subjective judgment is not enough with the large-scale data, which may produce results that are not convincing, or can’t constitute a reliable knowledge. Quality index is proposed in this paper, the subjective and objective aspects are integrated and information theory is introduced in order to quantify multi 
level association rule’s quality based on domain ontology Rules quality index can be used to guide the multi-level association rules analysis and redundancy treatment. The results can satisfy the precision in objective and the rule’s quality also can meet requirement for user application II  R ELATE C ONCEPTION  A  Association rule Let 000\003 I  I 1 I 2 I 3 I m be the attribute set of a database called items, and meanwhile each item I j 1 000 j 000 m is an attribute or a concept of ontology. Item set X is the set of 
items 000\003 where I X 002 000\021 Let T be set of transactions, for each transaction t i in T  t i 001\031 T and I t i 002 000\021 A transaction contains an item set X 002 if and only if i t X 002 000\021 The support of an itemset X is defined as the proportion of transaction in dataset which contains the itemset, denoted as  sup\(X Association rule is defined as an implication of the form X 001 Y where I X 002

The items in X, Y are the attributes or concepts of ontology and can be in different levels. The support of a rule is defined as the proportion of transaction in a transaction set which contains both itemset X and Y  denoted as sup \(X 001 Y  Association rule mining is the knowledge discovery process that finds the rules whose support and confidence are not less than a given value in transaction set.

Association rule mining can be done under the guidance of ontology; the multi-level association rules extracted from ontology meet the actual situation and also can express user’s purpose Information theory is the scientific study of measurement and transfer of information using mathematical statistics and probability theory, based on mathematical explanation of the relationship between probability and information redundancy. Amount of information and information entropy are the two most important concepts in information theory Definition :\( Amount of information\ If message a occurs on the probability p a n/m then the information amount of a  is defined to be I \(a\ =- log 2 p a log 2 m/n The amount of information expresses the information requirement  if one selects a state from an equally possible event, the less possibility of a message, the more information needed to identify the message; in contrast, the more possibility of a message, the less information needed to identify the message Definition :\( Information entropy\ If message a occurs on the probability p a n/m then the information entropy of a  is defined to be H \(a\ =-p a log 2 p a p a log 2 m/n The information entropy can be looked upon as the occurrence probability of a particular event. A special state occurring on a higher probability proves that it is spread more widely or has higher degree of citation. Information entropy can be used to express the value of information in terms of information dissemination III  Q UALITY E VALUATION OF M ULTI LEVEL A SSOCIATION R ULE B ASED ON O NTOLOGY  Multi-level association rules contain these rules that are extracted from same concept level or different concept levels. Generally, the knowledge represented by low-level association rules are less general, often have to be generalized to higher level  On the other hand, cross-level association rules contain higher actual value. The previous measures about rule quality evaluation are subjective simply or completely based on experiences which are not common and strict. We try to develop a new common and strict evaluation criterion to evaluate the quality of multi-level association rule, integrating domain knowledge and mathematic statistics, using subjective and objective measures A  Rule quality index Domain knowledge can be described by ontology Domain concepts are organized in a directed acyclic graph Figure 1.The associations among concepts are described and defined using ontology axioms  Theorem 1: High hierarchy concepts are supported by low hierarchy concepts, the range of high level concepts is the union of their children’s range separately 001\033 c  represents the range of concept  c the range is discrete\the ancestor concept’s range  000 c  000 c1 001 000 c2 001  001 000 cm 002 where c i 1 0010 i 0010 m is the descendant of c  if the size of 001\033 is n  then n c 0010 n c1 n c2 n cm 001   Figure.1. ontology example Normally higher hierarchy concepts are more general sometimes they can’t express information clearly, and user couldn’t obtain any definite knowledge. For example, the ontology shown in Figure 1, concept Meat  is a higher level concept, there are numbers of kinds meat, user don’t know the meat direct what kind of meat. Contrarily, the lower hierarchy concepts express clearer information, such as concept Beef  show distinct information, it indicate the concept represents the beef which is a meat Theorem 2  In the ontology, the higher level the concept is, the more abstract meaning they express and the more ambiguous its information is; the lower level the concept is the more detailed meaning they express and the clearer its information is According to the definition of amount of information, If message a occurs on the probability p a n/m then the information amount of a is I \(a\=- log 2 p a log 2 m/n In an ontology, if the range of concept c  is 000 with n-values, we assume concept c obtains each value with equal probability that’s to say the probability is p\(c=c i 1/n when concept c is valued c i 1 000 i 000 n So if we want to make c valued c i  we need the amount of information I\(c=c i log 2 p\log 2 n We also can define the information entropy for each concept belong to an ontology like the information entropy in information theory to be H\(c=c i p\(c=c i I\(c=c i  It is can be proved that the more diverse of a concept’s value \(the greater range 002\010 of the concept\, the greater amount of information the concept

contain, but the lower information entropy the concept has that’s to say the quality of information of the concept is lower, so when we consider to generalize a concept ,the quality of concept after generalizing must be considered   Theorem 3: They have the same meaning between the information quality description of concept based on information theory and the hier archy description of concept ontology-based  We can infer from Theorem 1 and Theorem 3 Inference 1  In ontology, the amount of information of a high hierarchy concept isn’t greater than the sum of its sub-concept. that is I\(c 0010 I\(c 1 I\(c 2 I\(c m  where c i 1 0010 i 0010 m is the sub-concept of c Inference 2: In ontology, the information entropy of a high hierarchy concept is not greater than any of its subconcept. That is H\(c 0010 H\(c i  where  c i is the sub-concept of  c Definition :\( average information entropy\ the average information entropy of rule is defined as the average of all items’ information entropy in the rule, which is k  item  H k 0 i i 000  where k  indications the number of items in rule Definition :\( quality index\ we define the quality index equal the average information entropy, the quality index of rule r denoted as Q\(r  Rule’s quality index measures the quality of the information contained in the rule, the higher the rule’s quality index, the better the quality of the rule. Ordinarily among the association rule, we mainly consider two aspects of strong association rule: on the one hand whether the rule has practical significance, association rule mining ontologybased extracts rules under the guidance of domain knowledge, the fetched rules can reflect user’s purpose and domain significance; on the other hand whether the rule’s significance is appropriateness, for this purpose, in most case low-level rules need to be generalized. This paper argues that when considering whether to delete the low-level rules or generalize rules based on ontology, we should consider the quality of the rules after generalized; we must assure the rule’s quality and then make the result with the overall general B  Utilize quality index Rule’s quality index can be used to guide redundancy treatment, in order to make rule meet objective requirements and the rule’s quality satisfy the user requirements Definition:\( quality loss\f the quality index of rule r 1 is  Q\(r 1  before generalized, then after generalized ,rule r 2 is generated, whose quality index is Q\(r 2  we define the quality loss l to be  100         1 2 1 2 1    r Q r Q r Q r r l 000E  According to previous theory, if we generalize rule to higher level, may lead to the quality decline  Quality loss expresses the information loss after generalized, and is used to determine whether to generalize the rules Algorithm 1 Input: rule set R; ontology onto; quality loss threshold e  Output: rule set R’ after processing  get concept  set  C  and range  000  from Onto for c  in  C begin H\(c  the information entropy of  c end for r in R begin  add r to R  Q\(r  the quality index of r If  r can be generalized  begin  generalize r to r   Q\(r’\=the quality index of r   l=\(Q\(r\-Q\(r’\/Q\(r\*100  if  l 000 e begin delete r from R calculate confidence for r  add r’ to R  end end end sort R’ according to Q\(r  IV  E XPERIMENT AND A NALYZE  The experiment was performed using a census income database with 32561 records and 11 attributes. The experiment’s purpose is to evaluate the quality of the rule for ontology-based multi-level association rule mining, so  ontology is extracted from the dataset, and then constructed using protégé, Fig.2. The ontology consists of three categories: education, personal and work. Attributes and concepts related to each cat egory are abstracted. Fig.3 shows the hierarchy of marital status  Figure.2.the ontology for census income In order to calculate information entropy for each concept in ontology, we assume each leaf node’s range is true false   this surmise corresponds with the actual situation take Fig.3 for example, the leaf node Divorced, its means whether the individual have divorced, this is a binary, and other nodes are also in the similar case. According to Theorem 1  the abstraction hierarchy concept’s range is the union of its descendants’ range. So, we can calculate each

concept’s information entropy, and then calculate the quality loss for general rules  Figure.3.married hierarchy We use Algorithm 1 to generalize extracted rules which can be generalized. Experimental environment is Intel\(R\ Core\(TM\ 2 Duo CPU E7500 @2.93 2.93GHz 2.00G memory; Window XP professional OS; open source data mining platform weka3.7 is used to mine rules. We set support to be 0.1, confidence to be 0.9, quality loss threshold e=0.1. There are 1384 strong association rules extracted.

According to the quality loss threshold set previous, the quality loss of rules 5, 12, after generalized, is greater than the threshold, this indicates that the generalized rules can not express the exact meaning users can not get meaningful information from the generalized rules. Take rule 5 for example, the original rule shows that the major person who works on craft-repair  is male, but, after generalized, its means that who work on service is male, obviously, it can’t express the exact meaning clearly, to a certain extent, the significance is inaccurate, not persuasive, so the rule can not be generalized. The other rules like 0 001 1 001 3 and so on, can be generalized within the acceptable quality loss threshold, these rules after generalized still express the significance very clearly, and association rules also meet with the general purpose after generalized in ontology and domain knowledge V  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  This paper introduces information theory and proposes rule quality index, which is used to quantify the quality of multi-level association rule. Rule’s quality index based on domain ontology and information theory, can measure rule quality from both subjective and objective aspect Redundancy treatment is an important topic in multilevel association rule mining. The future work is considering rule quality as a parameter during multi-level association rule mining ontology-based and rule redundancy treatment R EFERENCE  1  Claudia Marinica, Fabrice Guillet and Henri Briand.
