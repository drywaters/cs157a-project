published dataset containing records of interactions between a set of HIV-1 proteins and a set of human proteins has been analyzed using association rule mining The main objective is to identify a set of association rules among the human proteins with high con\002dence The well-known Apriori algorithm has been utilized for discovering the association rules Moreover we have predicted some new viral-human interactions based on the discovered association rules Index Terms 227Protein-protein interaction HIV-1\226human interaction association rule mining Apriori algorithm I I NTRODUCTION Analysis of the regulation between viral and host proteins in different organisms is an important step to uncover the underlying mechanism of various viral diseases Human immunode\002ciency virus HIV is a lentivirus a member of the 
retrovirus family with long incubation period that can lead to acquired immunode\002ciency syndrome AIDS a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail leading to life-threatening infections HIV 1 is a species of the HIV virus that relies on human host cell proteins in virtually every phase of its life cycle One of the main goals in research of Protein-Protein Interaction PPI is to predict possible viralhost interactions This is speci\002cally aimed at assisting drug developers targeting protein interactions for the development of specially designed small molecules to inhibit potential HIV1\226human PPIs Targeting protein-protein interactions has relatively recently been established to be a promising alternative to the conventional approach to drug design 3 There are several computational approaches for predicting PPIs 5 6 7 8 9 10 Most of these approaches 
are mainly used for determining PPIs in a single organism such as yeast human etc However determination of PPIs across multiple organisms such as between viral proteins and the corresponding host proteins can contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches and design of drugs for these viral diseases Moreover these methods are mainly based on designing some classi\002ers which need both positive and negative samples for PPIs Although there are several online resources that systematically store information about experimentally validated interacting proteins there is no such resource for non-interacting proteins which should be used as the ideal negative samples Therefore in most of the works in this area negative samples are prepared by taking random protein pairs which are not found in the interaction database This is done with the expectation that this random protein pairs are less likely to interact physically which may 
not be true always The performance of the classi\002er highly depends on the choice of the negative samples With this observation in this article we have proposed an approach based on association rule mining that uses information based on positive samples of experimentally validated PPIs only The PPI information among HIV-1 and human proteins are organized as a binary matrix with rows representing the viral proteins and columns representing the human proteins Thereafter the well-known Apriori algorithm  12 has been used for disco v ering association rules among the columns i.e human proteins Finally these rules have been utilized to predict some new viral-host interactions The remaining part of the article is organized as follows the next section discusses the basic concepts of association rule mining and describes the Apriori algorithm in brief for 
association rule mining in this regard Section III discusses how association rule mining can be used for predicting new interactions based on an existing HIV-1\226human PPI database In Section IV the experimental results have been provided Finally Section V concludes the article II A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING The principle of association rule mining ARM problem lies in the market basket or transaction data analysis Many information is hidden in the day to day transactions taking place in supermarkets For example a customer who is buying nappy also likes to purchase baby food in the same time Association analysis is the discovery of rules showing attribute\226value associations that occur frequently Let I  f i 1 
 i 2      i n g be a set of n items and X be an itemset where X 022 I  A k itemset is a set of k items Let T  f  t 1  X 1    t 2  X 2        t m  X m  g be a set of m transactions where t i and X 
i  i  1  2      m  are the transaction identi\002er and the associated itemset respectively The cover of an itemset X in T is de\002ned as follows cover  X T   f t i j  t i  X i  2 T X 022 X i g  1 


The support of an itemset X in T is support  X T   j cover  X T  j 2 and the frequency of an itemset is f requency  X T   support  X T  j T j  3 Thus support of an itemset X is the number of transactions where all the items in X appear in each transaction The frequency of an itemset is the probability of its occurrence in a transaction in T  An itemset is called frequent if its support in T is greater than some threshold min sup  The collection of frequent itemsets with respect to a minimum support min sup in T  denoted by F  T min sup  is de\002ned as F  T min sup   f X 022 I  support  X T   min sup g  4 The objective of ARM is to 002nd all rules of the form X  Y  X T Y   with probability c   indicating that if itemset X occurs in a transaction the itemset Y also occurs with probability c   X and Y are called the antecedent and consequent of the rule respectively Support of a rule denotes the percentage of transactions in T that contains both X and Y  This is taken to be the probability P  X S Y   An association rule AR is called frequent if its support exceeds a minimum value min sup  The con\002dence of a rule X  Y in T denotes the percentage of the transactions in T containing X that also contains Y  It is taken to be the conditional probability P  X j Y   In other words conf idence  X  Y T   support  X S Y T  suppor t  X T   5 A rule is called con\002dent if its con\002dence value exceeds a threshold min conf  Formally the ARM problem can be de\002ned as follows Find the set of all rules R of the form X  Y such that R  f X  Y  X Y 022 I X T Y    X S Y 2 F  T min sup   conf idence  X  Y T   min conf g  6 Generally the ARM process consists of the following two steps  15  1 Find all frequent itemsets 2 Generate strong ARs from the frequent itemsets Apart from the above mentioned general framework adopted in most of the research in ARM there is another approach for immediately generating a large subset of all ARs The number of itemsets grows exponentially with the number of items j I j  A commonly used algorithm for generating frequent itemsets is the Apriori algorithm 12 This is based on the idea that if even one subset of an itemset X is not frequent then X cannot be frequent It starts from all itemsets of size one and proceeds in a recursive fashion If any itemset X is not frequent then that branch of the tree is pruned since any possible superset of X can never be frequent III ARM IN V IRAL H OST PPI In this section the procedure for mining ARs from HIV-1\226 human PPI network has been described First we describe the preparation of the input data set Thereafter how to apply Apriori algorithm on the input data set to discover highly con\002dent rules and how these rules are used to predict new interactions are discussed A Preparation of Input Data Set The interaction information reported between HIV-1 and human proteins in which has been prepared based on a recently published PPI data set has been collected The interaction data set contains three types of interactions viz group-1 interactions representing direct physical interactions group-2 interactions representing indirect interactions and the other interactions that are predicted using their method The third kind of interactions are marked as Novel interactions which are computationally predicted by Tastan et al We have concentrated our study only on group-1 and group-2 interactions since these are experimentally validated There are total 1288 group-1 and group-2 interactions between 17 HIV-1 proteins and 773 human proteins We have constructed a binary matrix of size 17 002 773  An entry of 1 in the matrix denotes the presence of interaction between the corresponding pair of HIV-1 and human proteins and an entry of 0 represents the absence of any information regarding the interaction of the corresponding viral and human proteins Initially it is treated as non-interaction The resulting binary matrix is treated as the input to the ARM algorithm B Application of Apriori ARM Algorithm As discussed above the rows of the input binary matrix represent the viral proteins and the columns represent the human proteins Here each row viral protein has been considered as a transaction and each column human protein has been considered as a item Thereafter the Apriori algorithm is applied on this transactions to 002nd frequent itemsets and from these frequent itemsets highly con\002dent ARs are extracted Note that we have only concentrated on the rules with only one item in the consequent Hence an example of a discovered AR may be of the form f HP 1 HP 2 HP 3  HP 4 g  Here HP i s i  1  2  3  4  represent four human proteins In words the rule can be read as follows if the human proteins HP 1  HP 2 and HP 3 interact with some viral protein the human protein HP 4 also interacts with the same viral protein Corresponding to each rule there is an associated set of HIV-1 proteins for which the rule is true C Prediction of New Interactions from ARs We have utilized the discovered ARs that have high con\002dence to predict new viral-host interactions as follows Consider a rule f HP 1 HP 2 HP 3  HP 4 g  Suppose in the frequent itemsets the antecedent of the rule is true for 8 viral proteins f V P 1  V P 2      V P 8 g  Now without loss 


of generality assume that among these 8 viral proteins the consequent of the rule is true for the 002rst 6 viral proteins f V P 1  V P 2      V P 6 g  Therefore the rule has a con\002dence of 75 6 out of 8 which can be thought as reasonably high From this we can predict that the human protein HP 4 is likely to interact with the viral proteins V P 7 and V P 8 also and the con\002dence of this prediction is 75 Thus two new interactions are predicted  V P 7  HP 4 and V P 8  HP 4  This way from all the high-con\002dent rules we can predict some new interactions with certain levels of con\002dence IV R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION This section describes the experimental results First the effects of the parameters min sup and min conf on the number of extracted ARs have been investigated Thereafter the discovered high-con\002dent rules have been reported for a particular min sup and min conf  Finally we have reported the newly predicted interactions among the HIV-1 and human proteins A Effects of min sup and min conf T o study the effect of min sup and min conf on the number of generated ARs the min sup has been varied from 30 to 50 with step size 5 and the min conf has been varied from 65 to 90 with step size 5 and the number of ARs generated for all the combinations of min sup and min conf ha ve been noted down Fig 1 shows the variation of number of rules for the different values of min sup and min conf  The number of ARs have varied from 0  min sup 50 min conf 90 to 671  min sup 30 min conf 65 It is evident from the 002gure that the number of ARs is large when both min sup and min conf are on the lower side whereas the number of ARs is small when both min sup and min conf are high This is quite obvious since large min sup and min conf impose more constraint on the ARs and thus reducing their numbers Fig 1 Variation of number of rules with respect to different values of min sup and min conf B Demonstration of Generated Rules In this section we have reported the rules generated with min sup and min conf v alues of 40 and 70 respectively Table I shows these rules with their support and con\002dence There are total 34 rules generated with the above mentioned values of min sup and min conf  For each rule the human proteins in the antecedent part and the consequent part of the rule are shown Note that here we have only considered rules with only one protein in the consequent part As is evident from the table there are 21 rules with only one human protein in the antecedent part Rules 1 to 21 11 rules with two human proteins in the antecedent part Rules 22 to 32 and 2 rules with three human proteins in the antecedent part Rules 33 and 34 As the min sup v alue is set to 40 each rule the associated frequent itemset has support  40 More speci\002cally there are 22 rules with support 41.2 7 rules with support 47.1 4 rules with support 52.9 and 1 rule with support 58.8 Similarly as min conf 70 all rules have con\002dence  70 There are 5 rules with con\002dence 75 4 rules with con\002dence 77.8 1 rule with con\002dence 80 15 rules with con\002dence 85.7 1 rule with con\002dence 87.5 and 8 rules with con\002dence 100 The rules with one human protein in the antecedent part signify that among all the HIV-1 proteins with which the human protein in the antecedent interacts the human protein in the consequent is found to interact with c  of those viral proteins where c is the con\002dence of the rule For example the Rule 1 implies that the human protein ACTG1 interacts with 75 of the viral proteins with which the human protein ACTB interacts Hence it can be inferred that the human protein ACTG1 also interacts with the remaining 25 viral proteins and the con\002dence of this inference is 75 The rules with 2 or 3 human proteins in the antecedent can be interpreted similarly For example Rule 22 can be interpreted as follows the human protein PRKCD interacts with 85.7 of the viral proteins with which both PRKCB1 and PRKCQ interact Similarly Rule 33 says that the human protein PRKCD interacts with 85.7 of the HIV-1 proteins with which all of PRKCB1 PRKCQ and PRKCA interact C Predicting New Interactions In this section we have reported the new interactions predicted from the rules generated as shown in Table I using the method discussed in Section III-C It should be noted that the new interactions can be predicted only from the rules with con\002dence less than 100 Hence for predicting new interactions the rules with 100 con\002dence are discarded 002rst Thereafter the method discussed in Section III-C is applied to predict new HIV-1\226human PPIs Table II reports these new predicted interactions between viral and human proteins The con\002dence of the prediction is also given for each predicted interaction Note that a particular interaction may be predicted from more than one rule but each of these rules may have different con\002dence While reporting the con\002dence of such predicted interactions the maximum con\002dence among the con\002dences of the predicting rules has been reported The interaction between a viral protein V P and human protein HP has been denoted by V P  HP  The predicted interactions have been grouped by con\002dence level There are unique 22 newly predicted interactions that are

Performance Study To confirm the time efficient approach of the algorithm, we implemented the proposed algorithm and the apriori algorithm on a 512 MB RAM Memory and 1.67 GHz Intel processor. We carried out a substantial performance evaluation and compared it with results obtained for apriori algorithm Table 3 compares performance of the proposed algorithm with the apriori algorithm for different minimum supports against different number of transactions. As minimum support decreases, the performance of the proposed algorithm increases and after a certain point, it performs better than the apriori algorithm. The relative performance also increases with increase in number of transactions. These results are also demonstrated in Figure 1. Total number of data items and average number of items per transaction are 30 and 15 respectively Table 4 compares the number of items in MEDIUM and LOW corresponding to the data values shown in Table 3 The execution time is shown to compare the increase in performance with increase in number of candidate sets in LOW Figure 2 compares the number of elements in MEDIUM and LOW against different number of initial data items for a given database and minimum support. For this experiment number of transactions in the database is 2K and minimum support is 20%.The proposed algorithm performs better with increase in the number of candidate sets present in LOW Figure 2 shows that the number of elements in MEDIUM and LOW increases with increase in number of data items Thus, the proposed algorithm performs better for large number of data items in the database 5.1 Result Analysis The performance of the proposed algorithm is directly proportional to the number of passes over the algorithm number of elements in LOW and data items in the database During initial passes, size of L k C k and 007 004 k is more than the database. Hence, initial passes are time consuming. But during the latter passes, these data sets become significantly smaller than the database. Larger minimum support generates less number of candidate sets and involves lesser passes over the algorithm. Thus, Figure 1 shows a dip in performance of the proposed algorithm for larger minimum support values. But, it performs better than the apriori algorithm as minimum support decreases  Table 3: Execution time in seconds   Table 4: Execution time v/s size of MEDIUM and LOW  6. Conclusion and future directions The proposed algorithm presents a probabilistic approach to apriori algorithm. The proposed algorithm creates exactly the same number of rules as the apriori algorithm but in lesser time. The results confirm that the discovery of association rules in larger databases is faster in the proposed algorithm than the apriori algorithm Integration of probabilistic approach to data mining in distributed databases shall produce amazing results [9 Hence, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm needs to be checked on distributed databases. This algorithm was implemented on a synthetic database. Its application on real
