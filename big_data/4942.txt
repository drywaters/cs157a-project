infrastructure to tackle undesired events in the course of usage of the systems One of the promising domains of applying intrusion detection is the healthcare domain A typical healthcare scenario is characterized by high degree of mobility frequent interruptions and above all demands access to sensitive medical records by concerned stakeholders Migrating this set of concerns in pervasive healthcare environments where the traditional characteristics are more intensiìed in terms of uncertainty one ends up with more challenges on security due to nature of pervasive devices and wireless communication media along with classic security problems for desktop based systems Despite evolution of automated healthcare services and sophistication of attacks against such services there is a reasonable lack of techniques tools and experimental setups for protecting hosts against intrusive actions This paper presents a contribution to provide a host-based anomaly modeling and detection approach based on data mining techniques for pervasive healthcare systems The technique maintains normal usage proìle of pervasive healthcare applications and inspects current workîow against normal usage proìle so as to classify it as anomalous or normal The technique is implemented as a prototype with sample data set and the results obtained revealed that the technique is able to perform classiìcation of anomalous activities Keywords Intrusion Detection Systems Pervasive Medical Systems Security Data Mining I I NTRODUCTION In recent years the use of pervasive technologies in healthcare domain is increasingly a common practice These systems use large-scale deployment of sensing and communication technologies Their aim is to continuously monitor patients history and subsequently to deliver accurate health information to medical professionals thereby facilitating timely diagnosis and treatment for health problems Moreover a typical pervasive healthcare scenario is usually nomadic in which the healthcare personnel exhibit mobility and interrupted operations at the same time by providing round-the-clock healthcare outside the conìnes of traditional medical establishments 2 3 Differently from a traditional paper-based system a pervasive healthcare system collects and manages health data in an electronic record This means that a signiìcant portion of information much of which is sensitive about patients health status e.g blood pressure and heart beat is collected from different devices monitoring the patients health and recorded in electronic format for subsequent processing These devices also monitor the processed information can also be sent from other such devices and alarm the medical staff only whenever like for example blood pressure becomes out of the expected range for some speciìc patient These all are done without necessarily requiring intervention by the medical staff\(s Notice however that such usage imposes many security risks to the health information that did not exist before with paper-based system Providing a proper security mechanism in this domain is therefore as critical as giving proper medication facilities to patients to ensure safety of sensitive medical detail from being compromised This would allow the possibility of maintaining data conìdentiality integrity of data and provides strong authentication features thereby controlling unauthorized access of personal health information Unfortunately security is more complicated when we use pervasive devices in healthcare environments for several reasons For example the wireless links used in pervasive environments make passive eavesdropping and active interference possible This contributes to the aggravated security problems since devices that are involved in such engagement report their state and sensor information to other objects These devices are also less physically secured as compared to nodes used in xed networks which in turn contributes to the ease of compromising the devices Another reason is that the speciìc case where pervasive computing infrastructure is deployed in a healthcare system This often ends up with more concerns about security for the reasons such as increased data aggregation ubiquitous access and increasing dependency on technical solutions see also in 3 6 In fact there are various approaches that are commonly taken to address the aforementioned challenges by highlighting the security and dependability consequences of any speciìc choice Among them intrusion detection has been shown to improve the security of complex systems 8  Intrusion detection systems IDSs v ary in scope and focus ranging from simple host-based rewalls and authentication to sophisticated distributed detection and protection systems However these techniques are not tailored to particular requirements of pervasive systems in general and pervasive healthcare in particular As a result investigating a technique based on anomaly-based intrusion detection is 978-1-4244-8642-7/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 


taken as one remedy to relief scarcity of tools and techniques in achieving better security in pervasive healthcare This paper presents anomaly-based intrusion detection approach for pervasive healthcare systems The anomaly detection model is based on normal activity proìle of pervasive healthcare applications and it evaluates current workîow against normal usage proìle of the applications by employing appropriate data mining techniques The normal usage proìle is constructed by using a sample dataset containing both normal and abnormal application usages Each request sent from a mobile device to the server side application is trapped and then passed to the classiìer The classiìer categorizes the request as normal or abnormal based on the already maintained usage proìle Finally the classiìer maintains the responses in a passive way by keeping each individual record of the event of the intrusive activity We believe that this work leverages the lack of anomaly detection model and tool-support for pervasive healthcare environments The paper is structured as follows Section II brieîy describes the motivation and background material for this work Section III presents our anomaly detection model in detail In section IV we demonstrate the prototype implementation of the model with discussion of the results obtained Related work and conclusion and future work are given in Sections V and VI II B ACKGROUND AND M OTIVATION Context-aware vs Location-based Context awareness differently from traditional computing allows to actively exploring physical location available computing infrastructures and facilitates the delivery of services through these infrastructures to fulìll and enhance their ability to perform designated tasks 11 A typical healthcare environment requires a locationbased computing to enable the delivery of accurate medical information as well as to reduce errors and improve access In the authentication process for example there are interrupted operations where the healthcare staffs usually tend to login but forget to logout This is basically because a medical staff is nomadic while login is xed to one computer in the traditional computing Pervasive computing in general and their devices  such as PDA mobile phones and the like in particular are widely deployed in healthcare environments Reasons include these devices have nomadic characteristics and due to the mobility of healthcare professionals 13 One possible scenario for a pervasive healthcare system that integrates the unique capabilities of some of these devices infrastructures and the medical staffs themselves is shown in Figure 1 Intrusion Detection Systems The use of pervasive technologies also comes with challenges that are more difìcult to solve compared to the traditional computing systems Figure 1 Pervasive healthcare scenario Among these challenges security is the major one Ensuring security in fact in this domain becomes more challenging in situations where sensitive medical systems are targeted Intrusion Detection Systems IDSs have been used in practice as a second wall to protect systems by monitoring resources and alerting in the event of a speciìc occurrence of an intrusive action 15 7 IDSs are cate gorized in to two based on their detection methods anomaly-based e.g see in 17 and misuse-based e.g see in 19 Anomaly-based IDS models use information about the normal behavior of the system they monitor by identifying normal features which will be used to build normal proìle More speciìcally anomaly detectors generate a model of the observed data about e.g trafìc behavior etc and compare the generated data against this model to check for anomalies However the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks is usually paid for in terms of a large number of false positives 21 This could mak e the system unusable by ooding and eventually desensitizing the system administrator with large numbers of incorrect alerts In contrast misuse-based IDS models analyze the system and compare the activity against signatures or patterns of known intrusive system or application behavior  21 19 IDSs that follo w the misuse detection model need to be constantly updated to stay a step ahead of the attackers and also suffer from false negatives Data Mining vs IDSs IDSs operating on data-intensive application domains rely on data mining techniques for their classiìcation and detection mechanisms Such techniques allow nding efìciently patterns structures or regularities and singularities in large and growing datasets 23 In line with this there have been a number of efforts exerted towards normal pattern discovery in a given large dataset Out of these efforts a signiìcant number can be allocated to healthcare and medical datasets 24 This can be attributed mainly to the sensitiveness of the domain and 


due to their link such as with insurance and other critical decisions Association rule mining see for a general survey in  has been e xtensi v ely in v estigated in the data mining literature For the association rule mining many efìcient algorithms have been proposed including a priori and FPTree growth 27 T ypically  this mining aims at discovering associations between items in a transactional database Several types of algorithms are particularly applicable for mining audit data from large data stores see e.g in 29 In this paper  w e use tw o o f the mining algorithms namely classiìcation rule mining and association rule mining for our anomaly detector III P ROPOSED A NOMALY D ETECTION M ODEL A Anomaly Detector Components Figure 2 shows the architecture of the anomaly detection model we propose In the architecture we distinguish two main components the mobile device component i.e the pervasive component and the server component The underling communication channel between the two components is established over a wireless link Requests for services are directly sent from the mobile device to the server The server responds to the pervasive device component with a record fetched from the database or an acknowledgment message  ClientSide Medial App Client Mobile Device Location Repository Request Manager Preprocessor Classiìer Response Manager Medical Record Store \(MRS ServerSide Medical App Anomaly Detector Server Class Association Rule \(CAR Anomaly Log Figure 2 Architecture of the Proposed Anomaly Detection Model The main components of the client mobile side include the end user application i.e the medical application and Location Record LR database The client mobile device is a medical application with which users communicate It enables sending a request to the serverês Request Manager based on the interaction of the users LR is a mobile side component used to store location information i.e persistent data At the same time this helps tracking the current location assuming that the device has location detection capability for our case we assumed GPS After establishing connection with the server the client devise sends the current location of the device along with each request sent from the client to the server On the other hand the following sub-components are responsible for various sever side computations The Request Manager is responsible for collecting requests sent by the client mobile side The requests in this context are aimed at manipulating the Medical Record Store MRS The requests are passed to the MRS in order to respond to the client mobile side The requests are also directed to the Preprocessor which basically involves categorizing locations with respect to known locations rather than using exact location information sent by GPS enabled pervasive device and categorizing timestamps into time categories e.g like morning afternoon and night After preprocessing user requests are stored in the User Request URD and also see Figure 3 The information described above are the starting point for determining the association rules for our detection model More speciìcally we need to determine possible associations between the attributes in the URD along with their support and conìdence values This results in the association rules which are then basis for generating the classiìcation rules We use this to classify user requests as either normal or abnormal The classiìer determines whether the request is in harmony with the already maintained Class Association Rule CAR or not The CAR is constructed as shown in Figure 3 It maintains association between the MRS elds belonging to the normal class with conìdence and support values  Users' Request Dump \(URD Class Association Rule \(CAR Associative Rule Generator Classiìcation Based on Assocication, Rule Generator CBA-RG Users' Nominal Usage Proìle Builder Figure 3 The Classiìer Sub-Component Furthermore once the classiìer identiìes possible anomalous activity it keeps record of the anomalous activity in the Anomaly Log The record kept contains different information to identify the location information of mobile device and the nature of the intrusion This qualiìes our anomaly detector to be a passive detector at is keeps log 


information about the intrusion rather than taking proactive measures B Detection Algorithms We noted that for our purpose we use the classiìcation and association algorithms as discussed in background section Based on these we devise a normalcy based on the normal usage proìle constructed from a noise-free users request dump as discussed before The normalcy is deìned by creating associations between attributes of the users requests The association rule mining is implemented to identify association rules between the database attributes It nds all rules in the URD database that satisfy some minimum support and minimum conìdence constraints The classiìer deals with constructing accurate rules for classiìcation Moreover as a result of the need to involve both the association and classiìcation rules we use the integration of the association and classiìcation rules The integration is done by focusing on mining a special subset of association rules which is indicated by the Class Association Rules CARs The special subset is determined by selecting rules whose right-hand-side are restricted to the classiìcation class attribute This is normal in our case since our target is to implement anomaly detection As a consequence of this merging we used the integrated framework name associative classiìcation Note that the architecture for constructing the rules for classiìcation is the one shown in Figure 3 Adaptation of the existing association rule mining algorithm to mine only the CARs is needed so as to reduce the number of rules generated Thus this helps avoiding combinatorial explosion The users normal usage proìle is constructed by collecting users activities in URD With the assumption that the URD contains noise-free data we use it to build the normal usage proìle after the data in the URD being undergone preprocessing The goal of mining association rules is to derive multi-feature attribute correlations from a database table Formally given a set of records in which each record is a set of items an association rule is an expression of the form X  Y conf idence support where X and Y are subsets of the items in a record support is the percentage of records that contain X  Y  whereas conìdence is of the form support  X  Y  support  X   The associative classiìcation is based on the assumptions that the dataset is a normal relational table as indicated in  The table consists of N cases described by l distinct attributes These N cases are classiìed into q known classes Let D be the dataset Let I be the set of all items in D  and Y be the set of class labels We say that the data case d  D contains X  I if X  d  A class association rule of CAR is an implication of the form X  y  where y  Y  A rule X  y holds in D with conìdence c if c  of cases in D that contain X are labeled with class y  The Classiìcation Based on Association CBA algorithm constitutes two parts the Rule Generator CBA-RG and Classiìer Builder CBA-CB Notice that the CBA is based on Apriori algorithm see in which we used to nd the association rules The key operation of our implementation of the CBARG algorithm is to nd all ruleitems that have support with a given minimum support minsup A ruleitem is of the form  condset y   where condset is a set of items y  Y is a class label The support count of the condset  condsupCount is the number of cases in D that contain the condset  The support count of the ruleitem  rulesupCount  is the number of cases in D that contain the condset and are labeled with class y Each ruleitem basically represents a rule  condset  y  whose support is  rulesupCount  D    100  where  D  is the size of the dataset and whose conìdence is  rulesupCount/condsupCount   100  We call those ruleitems that satisfy minsup frequent ruleitems  while the rest are called infrequent ruleitems   Algorithm 1 The CBA-RG 1 F1   large 1-ruleitems  2 CAR1  genRules\(F1 3 prCAR 1  pruneRules\(CAR 1  4 for all k=2;F k  1    k do 5 C k

ruleitems by making multiple passes over the data The rst three lines of the algorithm deal with describing what happens on the rst pass The genRules functionality generates rules based on the 1-frequent ruleitems The prCAR 1 contains the pruned CAR 1  The function pruneRules uses the pessimistic error rate based pruning method It prunes a rule as follo ws If pessimistic error rate of rule r is higher than the pessimistic error rate of rule r  obtained by deleting one condition from the conditions of r  then rule r is pruned This pruning can cut down the number of rules generated substantially For each subsequent pass say pass k  the algorithm performs four major operations First the frequent ruleitems 


F k  1  found in the  k  1 th pass are used to generate the candidate ruleitems C k using the condidateGen function It then scans the database and updates various support counts of the candidates in C k  After those new frequent ruleitems have been identiìed to form Fk the algorithm then produces the rules CAR k using the genRules function Finally rule pruning is performed on these rules The candidateGen Algorithm 2 function is similar to the function Apriorigen in algorithm Apriori  Algorithm 2 Generating candidate set 1 for all itemsets c  C k do 2 for all k-1 s of c do 3 if s   F k then 4 delete c from C k 5 end if 6 end for 7 end for If for example the following set contains the set of itemsets in a 3-frequent ruleitems and it is required to generate C 4  F 3   123    124    134    135    234  After candidate generation  1234    1345  and after pruning  1234   Moreover the set containing  12 34  is pruned from the candidate set because  145  and  345  are not found in F 3  The ruleSubset function takes a set of candidate ruleitems C k and a data case d to nd all the ruleitems in C k whose condsets are supported by d  This and the operations in the next three lines are also similar to those in algorithm Apriori The dif ference is that we need to increment the support counts of the condset and the ruleitem separately whereas in algorithm Apriori only one count is updated This allows us to compute the conìdence of the ruleitem  The nal set of class association rules is in CAR s  The remaining rules after pruning are in prCAR s  Once the CAR is built the Classiìer consumes it to identify user activities The classiìer needs to have multiple passes through the CAR database To positively contribute to the efìciency of the classiìcation algorithm a number of data structures are used to contain and manipulate the database for faster access In line with this the classiìer building algorithm in is used IV P ROTOTYPE I MPLEMENTATION AND E XPERIMENT We implemented a prototype system using J2ME in order to evaluate our approach discussed for developing the pervasive end application The mobile device side application is comprised of user interface components speciìcally adapted to the device to read inputs and display formatted outputs to the users Figures 4\(a and 4\(b show the interfaces used for registering medical information and viewing medical record of patients respectively Whenever requests are sent via a Wi-Fi connection to the server the Apache web container delivers the requests to the server side application and responses to the client mobile device We used Java Servlets to implement the server side application and the Servlets are responsible to respond to the requests after communicating with the MRS i.e Medical Record Store as required The MRS is implemented using MySQL Server The underlying hardware infrastructure setup includes a Palm PDA with IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi and PalmOS3.5 operating system on the client mobile device On the server side a Wi-FI enabled PC with Microsoft Windows XP SP2 was used We used a number of data structures in order to improve the efìciency of the classiìcation The central data structures for the implementation of our algorithm are Set List and Map which are collections in Java Set collection is used to maintain collections of the datasets from the database Each entry of our Set contains a List object each representing collection of cases for each distinct attribute in the database This has great performance advantage since we can nd all the items in the Set object rather than making multiple scans of the database Map is the other important collection we have implemented for maintaining the frequent ruleitems i.e F k  and rules i.e CAR k  The key of the Map objects for F k and CAR k are Set objects representing our condset  Since it is not possible to have multiple keys the keys can simply be maintained in a Set object For constructing the class association rules we used twenty record sample noise-free dataset of a single user i.e a medical doctor The noise free dataset is required to avoid modeling wrong information When the dataset is collected from the on-spot usage environment if an abnormal usage is registered as a normal usage the model nally includes this abnormal usage as a normal usage resulting in a poisoned model that misleads the classiìer Table I shows a sample dataset that contains different requests at different time ranges to access the vital signs record Each record is tagged with either the normal or abnormal class category Table I S

rule 1 and is used as a normal usage proìle for that speciìc user Note that to generate the association rules for the normal records we run the RuleGenerator module which is a Java class of our system on demand basis 1 Note that the entire generated association rule contains over 300 records for the purpose of demonstration we only show a small subset 


a Patientês follow up data registration b Viewing patientês treatment information Figure 4 Example Pervasive Medical Application On rule ID76 for example we have the rule condition timeStamp  ntrequestT ype  readlocation  room 12 with support 15.00 and conìdence 50.00 As explained in Section III-B thus this indicates rule timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 normal  supt 15  00  conf d 50  00  Table II S AMPLE OF GENERATED A SSOCIATION R ULES   ID Rule Condition Support  Conìdence  1 clienName:doctor1 50 50 3 clienAddr:127.00.1 50 50 8 requestType:read 50 66.67 12 timeStamp:am 25 50 56 clientAddr:127.0.0.1 recordID:105 10 50 76 timeStamp:nt requestType:read location:room12 15 50 90 requestType:read dataSource:vital-signs timeStamp:am 25 100 Based on the noise-free sample dataset used for rule generation and the above rule we can say that 15.00 of cases in the dataset contain timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 and are labeled normal The support value in this case tells us that with respect to the whole dataset used for rule generation only 15.00 include the data timeStamp  ntrequestT ype  readlocation  room 12 and they belong to the normal class category By this we mean that reading patient record at night from room number 12 has only 15.00 normalcy support In addition the conìdence value indicates 50.00 of the cases in the dataset containing timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read,location  room 12 are labeled with normal class category This refers to considering only those entries in the dataset which contain timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 and out of these only half of them are tagged with the normal class category This simply means that only half of the cases of reading patient record at night from room number 12 is normal Considering another example on rule ID90 requestT ype  read dataSource  vital  signs timeStamp  am with support 25.00 and conìdence 100.00 This corresponds to the rule requestT ype  read,dataSource  vital  signs timeStamp  am  normal  supt 25  conf d   The rule tells us that one fourth of the data in the dataset used for rule generation contain the data requestT ype  read dataSource:vital-signs timeStamp  am and are normal Hence reading patients vital sign records in the morning has a quarter normalcy support Such a conìdence shows that 100 of the cases in the dataset contain requestT ype  read dataSource  vital  signs timeStamp  am and all of them are agged to be normal This rule means that 15.00 of cases in the dataset contain timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 and are labeled normal and 50.00 of the cases in the dataset that contain timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 are labeled with normal class category Notice that all the rules are not selected based on minimum conìdence and support For example for the precision of the classiìer which is based on the rules for normalcy conìdence percentages could be xed with values more than 90 Finally taking the rules generated our classiìer identiìes based on the proìle maintained for the speciìc user category each request received from the different users as normal or abnormal Afterwards whenever the user sends a request from the mobile device the request is also sent to the 


classiìer in order to identify the nature of the request normal or abnormal based on the normal usage proìle maintained previously Since we used a passive anomaly detector in terms of response action the result of the classiìcation is recorded in the anomaly log database using the ResponseM anager module V R ELATED W ORK A paradigmatic example for how to do host-based IDSs approach is presented in If the system call traces of normal applications are self-similar then it is straightforward to build an IDS that allows to learn the normal behavior of applications and recognizes possible attacks by looking for abnormalities For learning the IDS gathers system call traces from times when the system is not under attack extracts all sub-traces containing consecutive system calls and creates a database of these observed sub-traces which in turn are deemed anomalous if it does not appear within the database In the monitoring the abnormality of a new system call trace is measured by counting how many anomalous sub-traces it contains A process mining framework that utilizes the concept of clinical pathways to facilitate the automatic and systematic construction of an adaptable and extensible detection model is presented in The authors took a data-centric point of view and considered healthcare fraud and abuse detection as a data analysis process This automatic approach eliminates the need to manually analyze and encode behavior patterns as well as the guesswork in selecting statistics measures The proposed framework was evaluated via real-world data to demonstrate its efìciency and accuracy In the authors presented a more-rob ust anomaly detection IDS using data mining techniques The techniques are designed to dynamically model what a normal network should look like at the same time aimed to reduce the false positive and false negative alarm rates in the process Moreover the authors used classiìcation-tree techniques to accurately predict probable attack sessions Overall their goal is to model network trafìc into network sessions and identify those network sessions that have a high-probability of being an attack Various work have been going on mining audit data for IDSs In this area the work closest in spirit to ours can be found in where the authors describes a n o v e l framework name MADAM ID for mining audit data in order to construct models automatically for the intrusion detection The framework compute activity patterns from system audit data and extracts predictive features from the patterns It then applies machine learning algorithms to the audit records that are processed according to the feature deìnitions to generate detection rules Past results on the DARPA ID Evaluation showed that their ID model was one of the best performing of all the participating systems The related works described also several other works in IDSs use several techniques such as machine learning state-machine abstraction process mining and even data mining Our work is not aimed at advancing such approaches Rather it tailors host-based anomaly modeling and detection technique to pervasive healthcare systems and the use of data mining is traced back to the beauty of data mining techniques in extracting patterns from large dataset In this regard pervasive healthcare systems are immediate candidates for data intensive domain We also pointed out that there is lack of tool-support for anomaly-based intrusion detection of pervasive healthcare systems To this end the anomaly detection model and the prototype implementation could help as springboard for the attempt in alleviating tool-support for intrusion detection of pervasive healthcare systems VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we described constructing anomaly detection model based on data mining techniques in a medical pervasive environment for legitimate users Due to the sensitiveness of medical records it must protect medical records both from outsiders and insiders who try to abuse their privileges What we can conclude from this work is that maintaining user activity information for intrusion detection can enhance the role played by the proposed model in protecting a pervasive healthcare system from insider attacks Moreover we demonstrated the algorithmic detail showing the way to accomplish this through maintaining associations between selected attributes to represent normalcy which is required for classiìcation purpose Finally we described the prototype implementation of the proposed model and discussed the results of evaluation Even though we proved that the algorithms devised in the anomaly detection work in practice the evaluation of algorithmic efìciency issues are left as future work The rules generated from a limited number of dataset are very large in number In order to identify an activity as anomalous the data structures used to maintain the rules resides in memory Consequently the speed of the classiìer is boosted at a cost of more memory consumption Another line of future work is to monitor a larger data set to determine the efìciency pattern as the data set size get larger As described in the proposed anomaly detection model we only used the association rule and classiìcation based on association techniques Nevertheless for better detection capabilities it is also advisable to include the sequence

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
