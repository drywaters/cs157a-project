 1  A Least Squares Fusion Rule in Multiple Sensors Distributed Detection Systems Ashraf M. Aziz, Senior Member, IEEE Electrical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering Al-Baha University, Al-Baha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia amaziz64@ieee.org  Abstract 227In this paper a new least square data fusion rule in multiple sensor distributed detection system is proposed In the proposed approach the central processor combines the sensors hard decisions through least squares criterion to make the global hard decision of the central processor In contrast to the optimum Neyman-Pearson fusion, where the distributed detection system is optimized at the fusion center level or at the 
sensors level but not simultaneously the proposed approach achieves global optimization at both the fusion center and at the distributed sensors levels. This is done without knowing the error probabilities of each individual distributed sensor Thus the proposed least squares fusion rule does not rely on any stability of the noise environment and of the sensors false alarm and detection probabilities Therefore the proposed least squares fusion rule is robust and achieves better  global performance Furthermore the proposed method can easily be applied to any number of sensors and any type of distributed observations The performance of the proposed least squares fusion rule is evaluated and compared to the optimum Neyman-Pearson fusion rule 
The results show that the performance of the proposed least squares fusion rule outperforms the performance of the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule 1  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  P ROBLEM F ORMULATION 2  3  P ROPOSED L EAST S QUARES F USION R ULE 3  4

The data fusion center is responsible for combining the individual sensors decisions and making a final global decision about the same hypothesis Such systems are expected to improve the system performance and be more reliable and immune to noise interference and electronic attack than a single sensor 
system [13-18    The optimum fusion rule under the assumptions that the apriori probabilities are known and each sensor uses the likelihood ratio test to arrive at its own local decision is derived in [13, 14   T h e  o p tim u m  f u s io n  r u le  f o r  u n k n o w n  a priori probabilities in terms of the Neyman-Pearson test at the local sensors, as well as at the fusion center, is derived in 15, 16   A c c o r d in g  to  N e y m a n P e a r s o n  s tr a te g y   th e  g lo b a l detection probability is maximized for a desired global false alarm probability In 14-17   it is  s h o w n  th a t th e  g lo b a lly  optimal solution to the combining strategy that maximizes the global detection probability for a fixed global false alarm probability when the distributed sensors transmit independent binary decisions to the fusion center, consists of likelihood ratio tests at all sensors and a Neyman-Pearson

Since the global solution is computationally infeasible 3 15-18   most publications assume the optimal solution only at the fusion center level therefore there is a degradation in the performance Performance analysis of distributed sensor systems, based on Neyman-Pearson criterion, is discussed in many publications [24-32   The optimality of Neyman-Pearson fusion of statistically independent sensor decisions has been investigated in many

Copyright  2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright  2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright  2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright  2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright  2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
