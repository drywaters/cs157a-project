A first step in achieving 
operational capability is demonstrating the fundamentals of the optical link in an equivalent environment. The International Space Station, with its vast capability, is well suited to accommodate payloads aimed at advancing the readiness of such technologies The Optical PAyload for Lasercomm Science \(OPALS\ to be launched to and operated on the ISS in late 2013, will attempt to downlink a short video to an optical ground station in California using a 1550 nanometer, 2.5 watt laser, over the course of a 90 day mission.  To achieve this, in addition to designing and building the ISS payload, the OPALS team has increased the capability of the existing ground station, as well 
as developed the interface to the ISS infrastructure that will allow operators to command it This paper will discuss the drivers and constraints created by designing to existing interfaces \(ISS flight, ISS operational ground system\hile following a Class D payload implementation \(NASA NPR 8705.4\ The paper will also provide some specific examples of programmatic and technical areas that have been shaped by these drivers and constraints T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  OPALS  A RCHITECTURE

 B IOGRAPHIES 19   1  I NTRODUCTION  Space-borne scientific instruments increasingly require higher communication rates to transmit their gathered data back to Earth or to support high-data rate applications \(e.g high-definition video streams p t i cal com m u n i ca t i on also referred to as \221lasercomm\222\s an emerging technology in which data is modulated onto lasers to transmit information. Because laser beams are significantly narrower than radio-frequency \(RF\ms, optical communication offers, among other things, the promise of delivering much higher power density, and thereby achieving much higher data rates than the state of the art with RF beams  
However, because laser beams are very narrow, the spacecraft must be able to very accurately point the laser beam to the receiving telescope on Earth as it travels across the sky, which is one of the primary challenges of lasercomm The Optical PAyload for Lasercomm Science \(OPALS\ a technology demonstration project that aims to address some of these challenges by downlinking a video over an optical channel from the ISS to the Table Mountain optical ground station in California. Its implementation approach is tailored to be consistent with a low-cost project, and it has adopted the Class D risk posture specified in NPR 8705.4 [4 en  it is launched in the second half of 2013, OPALS will become the first JPL-built space-borne lasercomm 
technology demonstration, the first JPL-built unpressurized ISS payload, the first JPL payload to fly on the SpaceX Falcon9 Dragon vehicle, and the first Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism \(FRAM\o to fly on the Dragon capsule. It will also be among the first FRAM-based payloads to undergo robotic extraction from the Dragon cargo trunk OPALS is being developed as part of JPL\222s Phaeton Program, a training program with the objective to rapidly train and grow early career professionals \(ECPs\ by providing hands-on experience developing small, flight payloads aet on pro j ect s are s t aff e d an d m a n a g e d b y  ECPs, with strong mentorship and guidance from senior managers and engineers. The implementation approach for the Phaeton projects provides the ECP participants 
experience with all phases of a typical NASA project and allows them hands-on experience throughout their lifecycle Upon delivery of the payload for final ISS interface testing and launch vehicle integration, OPALS will be launched and operated as a NASA payl  This paper starts with a description of the OPALS architecture in section 2 followed by the concept of operation in section 3. It then breaks down the project\222s interactions with the ISS Program \(section 4\ into its three major areas. Finally, section 5 addresses some of the architectural and design changes that ensued as a result of internal and external drivers and constraints. This includes 


  2 the challenges and advantages, both technical and procedural, of being implemented as a Class D payload Technical case studies will address the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf \(COTS\ electronics, a novel forced convection cooling approach, and safety-critical aspects of the design. Systems engineering processes discussed will include requirements flow-down from a known interface scope and size of verification and validation program technical margin management. Lastly, the conclusions are discussed in section 6 2  OPALS  A RCHITECTURE  OPALS is more than just the hardware that will be externally mounted to the ISS. In addition to the payload Flight System \(FS\ALS includes a dedicated Ground System \(GS\ and Mission Operations System \(MOS Furthermore, it interfaces with the Marshall Space Flight Center for commanding the payload, and SpaceX, the launch vehicle provider, for ensuring physical compatibility Schematically, the architecture is depicted in Figure 1 Optical Communication Design As a low cost and high risk experiment, OPALS was never intended to improve the state-of-the-art of optical communications.  Instead, its focus has been on increasing the understanding in a few of the challenging areas of the field [7 w ill at te m p t to d o so b y d o w n li n k in g a s h o r tduration, DVD quality video at a relatively modest data rate of 30-50 Mbit/sec \(state-of-the art optical communication systems can support > 1 Gbit/sec links T h e areas of  focus for OPALS include 200  Atmospheric turbulence characterization, including obtaining downlink aperture-averaged fading statistics by recording received power, and uplink scintillation statistics by recording beacon power on the FS 200  Link availability and how it is impacted by geometry atmospheric & environmental changes, and day vs night effects 200  Pointing performance of the ground system\222s open loop tracking and the FS acquisition, tracking, and stability Key design parameters for the optical links are summarized in Table 1 Flight System Overview The flight hardware of the OPALS ISS payload is referred to by the team as the Flight System \(FS\. It is generally broken down into three major components: \(1\he drumshaped sealed container \(SC\ housing the avionics, laser and support electronics; \(2\he two-axis gimbal supporting the optical head \(OH\taining the camera and laser collimator; \(3\e top half of the FRAM\227called the Express Pallet Adaptor \(ExPA\\227which provides the mechanical and electrical interface to both the ISS and the SpaceX Dragon launch vehicle and was provided to the project free of cost by the ISS Program as contractorfurnished equipment \(CFE\. The FRAM used by OPALS was manufactured by SpaceX using NASA designs. It is the  Figure 1: The OPALS architecture contai ns elements beyond the ISS payload it self, all necessary to successfully launch and operate it 


  3 first one SpaceX has delivered to a payload developer Sealed Container 227The most prominent component of the FS is the oil drum-sized sealed container and its roughly 7.25 square-foot radiator \(Figure 2\ring 22 inches in diameter, and forged out of aluminum, the sealed container protects the COTS avionics from the harsh vacuum of space by providing a room temperature environment at one atmosphere. The avionics provide the functionality needed to control all aspects of the FS and communicate with the MOS via the ISS interface. The avionics include commercial FPGAs and processors hosted in a modified COTS PXI chassis. All of the components are laboratorygrade, National Instruments-type electronics available commercially. Figure 3 provides an overview of the makeup of the FS and the components\222 pedigree The SC also houses a ruggedized military-grade laser unit, a custom-built power distribution and conditioning board, two COTS motor drivers for controlling the bi-axis gimbal, and various telemetry-gathering instrumentation such as thermocouples and pressure transducers. All of these components are mounted on wire rope isolators to provide a more benign launch environment. All electrical and optical conduits are routed through the SC wall via vacuum-rated feedthroughs to the various connectors on the FRAM, the gimbal, and optical head OPALS is not the first ISS payload to employ such a COTSdriven design. The HICO payload, launched in 2009 and operating from the Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility \(JEM-EF\as demonstrated success employing a very similar approach  1 0  Gimbal & Optical Head\227 Sharing the real estate on the FRAM with the SC is the two-axis gimbal \(Figure 2\which points the optical transceiver towards the Ground System Actuation is performed by two microstepping motors whose range of motion is limited to an 110 373 x 40 373 field of regard FOR\ by hardstops.  An early, cost saving decision was to forgo the use of motor encoders in favor of a dead reckoning approach to gimbal pointing determination that counts commanded motor steps. As a consequence, the gimbal must be calibrated prior to each use to define axis reference points and to ensure accuracy and precision are preserved The approximately three-pound optical head \(OH\mounted on the elevation axis, houses a commercial camera sensitive at 976 nanometer used in acquiring and tracking the ground beacon, and a custom collimator used to beam the 1550 nanometer, two-watt laser towards the ground station. Like the gimbal, the OH was designed and built at JPL specific to this application using flight rated parts capable of withstanding the space environments. The mass and massdistribution of the OH were tightly controlled throughout the lifecycle to allow it to be perfectly balanced on the gimbal so that locks would not be required to keep it in place during launch. Instead, the gimbal uses the backdrive torque created by shorting the actuators\222 coils to effectively keep it immobilized when not in use Ground System Overview The Table Mountain Facility, located about 60 miles east of JPL in Wrightwood, CA, is home to the Optical  Figure 2: OPALS Flight System consists of the ISSprovided FRAM, a sealed container, and a two-axis gimbaled optical transceiver \(cabling not shown Table 1: Design parameters of the OPALS optical links DOWNLINK CHARACTERISTICS SIGNALING Parameter Units Modulation OOK  Uncoded BER 1.00E-04  ECC Reed-Solomon  Modulation Rate 30-50 Mb/s TRANSMITTER Downlink wavelength 1550 nm Beam Divergence \(1/e^2 1.0 - 1.6 mrad Average laser power 2.5 W Power transmitted from FS 0.833 W POINTING Pointing Bias 150.0 265rad Pointing Jitter \(RMS 125.0 265rad LINK GEOMETRY Max Zenith Angle 65 deg Max Range 700 Km BEACON CHARACTERISTICS  Uplink wavelength 976 nm Average Laser power 5 W Beam divergence 1.7 mrad Power transmitted from OCTL 1.26 W

It does not include any of the hardware software, or people that will operate the FS as well as the GS While leveraging the significant existing infrastructure at OCTL, OPALS has also developed a significant amount of hardware and software to enable it to be used as a Ground System \(Figure 4\Behind the one meter aperture of the main OCTL telescope, OPALS is implementing a set of optics to condition the 1550 nanometer light coming down from the ISS so it can be focused on a detector and to provide a 1.7 milliradian-wide beacon centered at 976 nanometer for the FS to lock onto and track Behind the optics, the detector turns photons into electrons which are then processed to recover the clock and the signal modulated on the downlink beam. The resulting bit stream is then passed to a software decoder, which reconstructs the file to its pre-transmission form. The GS also contains an Ethernet interface to mission ope rations to ensure adequate data transfer OPALS has also been able to leverage the existing OCTL three-tier laser safety system. This system disables the ground laser beacon when low flying objects, commercial air traffic, and sensitive satellites are overhead. The combination of hardware, software, and procedures already in place there will ensure that the laser beam emitted by the GS does not interfere with local air traffic Mission Operations System The Mission Operations System \(MOS\ a ground-based system consisting of all personnel, processes, facilities hardware, software, and networks required to support the successful operation of the payload and the optical ground station. For OPALS, the MOS is tasked with commanding the FS, processing telemetry, and displaying the reconstructed file within 10 minutes of receipt by the GS These mission objectives must be accomplished within the operational constraints imposed by the OPALS project and project partners to ensure safety of ISS personnel and OPALS hardware throughout the operational lifetime The OPALS MOS includes several components. For personnel, there is a flight operations team and a ground operations team. Hardware and software consists of four PC workstations equipped with software for command builds telemetry receipt, telemetry display, telemetry query ephemeris management, sequence builds, camera frame viewing, engineering log parsing, and configuration management. Lastly, operational processes documentation includes activity procedures, flight rules, and operational interface agreements to ensure proper remote operation of the FS and GS The MOS has major interfaces with the Payload Operations Integration Center \(POIC\ at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL, for operation of the Flight System and with the Optical Communications Test Laboratory \(OCTL in Table Mountain, CA, for storage and operation of the  Figure 3  Flight System Functional Block Diagram showing component pedigree

  8 The transition from idle state to gimbal activity state requires use of a set of critical commands to disable the gimbal safety inhibit. This inhibit prevents inadvertent operation of the laser during external crew or robotic activities by preventing actuation of the gimbal pointing. In order to disable the inhibit, a pair of two commands, one 223arm\224 and one \223fire\224, must be sent in succession to the flight software. Following receipt of these commands, the gimbal can be commanded to move away from the stow position and away from the limit switches that bound the range of motion Upon movement of the gimbal, the Flight System enters gimbal activity state. The primary operations activity within this state is the gimbal calibration, which defines the reference points for each axis. This activity is a sequence of movement commands that drive the gimbal through its full range of motion and establish reference points at the edge of each axis by measuring where the limit switches are actuated. Since the actuators lack encoders, the gimbal can only determine its position by counting commanded steps The transition from gimbal activity state to laser enabled state requires additional critical commands to be sent to the FS to disable the laser safety inhibits. The laser arm/fire critical commands disable the inhibit preventing closure of the 28V power relay to the laser. In order to decentralize the laser activation process for safety purposes, independent commands must be sent from the OPALS MOS and the POIC for 28V power to be routed to the laser. Each of the commands closes an independent power relay along the 28V power path on the FS power board. Once the 28V power is provided to the laser, the FS enters \223laser enabled\224 state The major activities in this state are the powering on of the flight camera and the powering of the flight laser unit to full power. The latter involves activating a 5V power relay to the laser booster, which is controlled by its own inhibit that requires an additional arm/fire command pair to be sent Once these major activities are complete, the FS can be commanded to point toward the first entry in the Blind Pointing Table, at which point, the FS is configured for Demonstration The FS enters demonstration state upon execution of the commence_demo command. Since this transition must be set to occur at a specific time determined by the ISS trajectory, this command will be scheduled in a command sequence. The Flight System restricts all commands during this state except for the abort_safe command to transition the entire payload to safe state, should an anomaly occur The sequence of activities in the demonstration state follows the description in the first part of section 3 The post-Demonstration activities involve safely powering off the laser, driving the gimbal to stow, and re-enabling all inhibits. These activities are accomplished by a post-demo command sequence that executes automatically upon nominal exit of demonstration state. Once all inhibits are  Figure 7: Flight System states diagram 


  enabled, the Flight System is returned to i d begin downlinking  accumulated engin e camera frames from the file system via t Once all products are downlinked and a fin a made, the 28V power is removed from the the Flight System activities.

  12 panel chair agrees with the approach he or she recommends it for approval to the PSRP. After many tweaks and focused discussion outside of the full PSRP the OPALS CBCS matrix was approved for Phase 2 As Phase 3 approaches, all agreed-to verifications of hazard controls must be performed, documented, and submitted Any deviations from the agreed-to verifications must be documented and approved by members of the PSRP In addition to the Flight Safety Reviews \(FSRs\und Safety Review schedule is also negotiated and a package is submitted.  This process is very similar to the PSRP one, but the scope of the hazards is limited to ground operations at the launch and processing facilities The key to successfully passing the FSRs has been constant early, and open communication with the PSRP. It has allowed for the quick identification of hazards and it has prevented the project from locking itself into designs that either could have adversely impacted safety or could have made compliance significantly more difficult. The PSRP and everyone involved in the safety side of the interface have shown great flexibility in allowing OPALS design freedom to ensure its mission success while enforcing a high standard for the safety of the ISS and those inhabiting it 5  D RIVERS   C ONSTRAINTS  AND R ESULTING I MPLEMENTATION  OPALS is no exception when it comes to facing the typical challenges that most space flight projects have to overcome throughout their lifecycle. Cost and schedule always seem insufficient. The workforce is sometimes stretched thin. All these challenges create constraints, end up driving the decision-making process and inescapably shape the final product. There are, however, many aspects that set OPALS apart from the average space borne instrument, and they too came with their own drivers and constraints Overall, the drivers and constraints can be classified as internal and external, with each category further divided into process- or technically-flavored This section is dedicated to examples, spanning each of those categories, of drivers and constraints that have in one way or another influenced the implementation of the project Internal, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints The aspects falling under this section refer to those whose common denominator is the internally-mandated JPL process. The most influential and prevailing of these processes are documented in the JPL Design Principles and JPL Flight Project Practices. These documents provide guidelines on everything from cost, schedule reserves and technical margins to the pedigree of the parts and components used by the flight article and the level of documentation required Class D 227The biggest impact on the project, second only to the stringent cost cap, was the decision to implement it as a Class D payload risk classification per NASA NPR 8705.4 This decision was less of a constraint than it was a driver and it ultimately gave the project more flexibility in making decisions. The ramifications of this decision are many including the risk posture of the project in parts selection sparing philosophy, hardware handling requirements qualification program, fault protection, and extent of formal verification of requirements Early on in its lifecycle, the project sought to define the Class D implementation approach within the guidelines set by NASA procedural requirements. Specifically the project was allowed to 200  Build one proto-flight model with limited engineering models \(EMs\he only subsystem to have a full EM is the avionics. Other EMs include the acquisition camera one motor driver, and the in-house developed power board 200  Limit parts sparing to long-lead items only. The project only purchased one spare actuator and a few of the avionics cards. There are no spares for the laser, power board, camera, or any structural components 200  Use COTS hardware wherever possible. This aspect is discussed in further detail in a subsequent section 200  Forgo radiation or parts support. The extensive usage of COTS components implies, to a large extent, the absence of radiation susceptibility data, along with other environmental information. Thus, as early as the Mission Concept Review, the project and its stakeholders have accepted the potential missionending risk of unrecoverable single event upsets 200  Limit hardware and software Quality Assurance prior to system level integration and test. Typically, HQA/SQA involvement begins early in subsystem development well in advance of system I&T 200  Limit flight tech support to final torqueing and high risk procedures. The philosophy here is similar to the HQA/SQA involvement Requirements and V&V\227 Likely the most unglamorous aspect of producing a space-wo rthy payload is developing the set of requirements that govern its function and behavior. While Class-D status does not give the project a pass on developing requirements, it can shape the way the process is conducted and the extent to which requirements are developed For example, higher-class projects typically develop requirements down to level five or six, and bin them in dozens, if not hundreds of sets or modules. By contrast OPALS currently only has 782 requirements spread over 33 modules, with none of them containing more than 105 items. Of the 694 ISS requirements only 376 are applicable to OPALS, accounting for 48% of the total OPALS set Similarly, of the 117 launch vehicle requirements, only 58 are levied on OPALS. This means that the project has only 


  348 project-specific requirements that it in t verify. Figure 13 breaks down the requirements, including ISS and launc h residing at the various levels OPALS, however, is no poster child f development as it fell into the same trap t h projects\227regardless of size and risk verification and validation \(V&V\ time: it unnecessary requirements At CDR time OPALS realized that requirements it was signing up to verify d and testing, totaling almost 1300 \(796 OP A LV\, had become unmanageable give n schedule and cost-to-go.

  15 manufacturer specification for vibration tolerance.  To deal with this issue, the rigid tray assembly that houses the avionics and fans is mounted on a system of wire-rope isolators designed to dampen random vibrations within the specific frequency spectra produced by the launch vehicle These isolators protect delicate solder joints and other nonrugged components from being torn apart by launch loads Further, in much the same way as the loss of circulation during power outages provides a natural means of insulation against heat loss, the wire rope isolator system\222s poor thermal conductivity also impedes conduction to the outer structure of the sealed container External, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints While many decisions were internally motivated by the JPL processes and the OPALS paradigm, a significant number also came via the ISS and launch vehicle interfaces, both programmatically and technically As one might anticipate, the ISS interface in particular impacted the OPALS day-to-day operations as well as the design features it implemented. The most clear example of this aspect came via the over 400 requirements imposed by the ISS program on the OPALS payload, followed by the V&V process mandated to demonstrate compliance Requirements 227As one of the first payloads to negotiate both the ISS and Dragon interfaces, OPALS has been routinely involved in technical changes beginning and ending with its interface requirements.  A considerable ongoing effort within OPALS and its partners has been to solidify the understanding of the requirements levied When OPALS began in 2009, the Dragon had neither flown nor been fully designed.  This was best represented in the miniscule 16 provided requirements that were largely placeholders for what would  become the Dragon\222s interface specification.  At that point, expectations were that OPALS would be completed well before its Dragon flight. This schedule disconnect led to a considerable technical disconnect In order to proceed with OPALS development despite the lack of a full set of design requirements assumptions had to be made in three key areas: power, connectivity, and the launch environment.  The first question of power came about for an obvious reason: OPALS has thermally sensitive optics and commercial equipment, and these components need heater power to be kept warm in space.  Without requirements on Dragon power provisions, the project\222s first assumption was that the thermal control hardware designed for the on-orbit ISS environment would also prove valid during a Dragon ascent.  After exhaustive integrated thermal analysis, this assumption, and the resulting engineering implementation, has proven to be valid, and an additional 12 pages of requirements and supporting data now reflect this interface design After requirements were negotiated and an agreement was reached to provide sufficient thermal power during ascent the question remained of how this power would be routed into the OPALS payload.  To direct the efforts towards a solution of connectivity, OPALS turned to the JAXA H-II Transfer Vehicle \(HTV\d Space Shuttle designs that powered FRAM-based payloads similar to OPALS.  These additional carrier requirements allowed several connectivity options and it was thus taken to be a valid assumption that the Dragon team could design around OPALS\222 desired cabling pin assignments.  The OPALS design was thus submitted to SpaceX and, as this was the first request for a specific option, the OPALS connectivity solution has become the primary power distribution option amongst external Dragon cargo requirements The project\222s greatest challenge, however, was the need to design the FS prior to receiving any validated launch  Figure 15: Early design of the sealed container did not optimize component pl acement or airflow  Figure 16: CFD analysis led to a new component layout that allowed for more efficient heat removal 


  16 loading requirements.  To address this, OPALS began with JPL and NASA\222s extensive historical data on expected launch loads, amended with ample margin and overlaid with standard levels on workmanship. The resulting crude spectrum was then supplied to the ISS and SpaceX dynamics teams who over the course of several months helped refine test plans to a conservative but agreeable level, which again proved to be valid \(and indeed conservative\via integrated analysis and testing. At the time of this writing OPALS had successfully completed vibration testing Lastly, the project has dealt with the uncertainty that comes via requirements variability from the ISS interface. Since OPALS began, 37% of the 694 ISS interface requirements have changed. Even though only 376 of them are applicable to OPALS, the project has had to maintain cognizance in this regard over the full set.  Despite the fact that the ISS is an operational facility and many components have been flying in orbit for several years, both OPALS and the ISSP are still learning about the function and performance of these components.  As such, there have been ample updates to the electrical and robotic interface requirement segments These requirement changes are executed methodically in a thoroughly reviewed manner.  After internal ISS coordination, pending requirement updates are quickly disseminated amongst payload developers.  After external review by existing and prospective payloads, signatures are requested and requirements are enacted V&V 227Verification and Validation includes the final work done to certify both that the payload meets the word of the requirements, and that it performs the intended function 55% of OPALS\222 requirements to be verified are provided by its external interfaces, including the ISS and Dragon Though verified along with all other project requirements these interface requirements demand a different balance of focus.  As these requirements are provided by external entities they are managed outside of JPL and subject to external verification.  OPALS, therefore, has no formal validation program for these requirements beyond ongoing interface systems engineering diligence.  While this externalized approach minimizes internal efforts, it simultaneously increases verification  overhead Verification of each external interface requirement falls under the cognizance of an external Discipline Engineer DE\d the OPALS verification program is built around this external approval process, which is diagramed in Figure 17.  These external engineers represent the external hardware expertise necessary to ultimately understand validate and approve all interactions with their hardware.  It is important to note that these engineers support a multitude of projects across geographic boundaries, and their ability to provide dedicated attention to OPALS is attenuated by the breath of the projects they support Internal to OPALS, an abundance of verification data is generated for these DEs in the verification of the 452 external requirements.  The planning, technical coordination, and direction of this work is coordinated between the OPALS External Interface Engineer and the cognizant engineers within OPALS. As data and plans have been generated over years of interaction among these organizations, it is incumbent upon the EIE to ensure internal consistency and remedy problems across evolving interfaces External, Technically-Derived Drivers and Constraints The ISS-imposed requirements provide the specification for the physical interface to the station, and, via the PSRP process, also provide direction on meeting the safety considerations that come with the Class A status of the ISS This section will highlight how technical specifications from the ISS impacted aspects of the OPALS design Mass & Power Budgets 227Most payloads will find the ISS allocation for mass and 28V operational power to be quite generous at 490 lbs. \(excluding the top half of the FRAM\227 the ExPA plate\d 504 watts, respectively. The ISS also provides 750 watts on a 120V operational line and an additional 300 watts of power on a 120V heater line Expected to come in under 400 lbs., OPALS fits well within its mass allocation. In fact, at no point in its development did the OPALS mass margin\227calculated as \(AllocationCBE\llocation\227fall below 15%, and since CDR it has been hovering around 30%. The 28V ops power margin has been even more generous, hovering at or above 60% for much of the projects lifecycle, while the 120V ops and 120V heater lines have seen equally generous margins of over 60% and 70 %, respectively In space, mass and power are drivers more often than not For OPALS the opposite has been the case, to the point where the excess allocations has been used to solve problems in other areas. One such example has been the  Figure 17:  The OPALS ISS requirement verification process is built around th e ISS approval process

  19 turn lead to a design that required forced convective cooling and vibration dampening, both uncommon for modern-day space payloads. Furthermore, it allowed the project flexibility in tailoring its verification and validation program for non-ISS requirements to save cost and schedule The focus of space-borne instruments is usually on the flight articles, which in the case of OPALS is the FRAM-based payload to be externally installed on the ISS. However most, if not all, projects must also develop a ground infrastructure to support the operations of the flight asset For OPALS, despite being more akin to an instrument than a spacecraft, that was certainly the case as significant development was required for both the optical ground station to enable the transmissi on of a beacon and receipt of the optical downlink for the former, and for the MOS to support commanding and telemetry The use of the OCTL facility in California greatly reduced the amount of development required to receive and process the optical downlink, and to transmit the beacon needed by the FS to locate the ground station. The development was thus restricted to the optics needed to condition the light beam for processing by the hardware receiver and the software decoder The design of the MOS was, by and large, dictated by the interface to the ISS\222s expansive payloads operations infrastructure located at Ma rshall Space Flight Center Because the interface was already mature and well understood, the project\222s efforts were primarily focused on ensuring compatibility rather than developing its own capability. The savings afforded by leveraging the existence of the already operating infrastructure cannot be understated A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors express their gratitude to the entire OPALS team for their dedication and hard work, and to the mentors that have guided the team on a path to success.
