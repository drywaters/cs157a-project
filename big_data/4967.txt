The distributed computing architecture is composed of a low power 003ight computer and a high power high speed auxiliary processor A schematic of the distributed computing architecture of this CubeSat is shown in Fig 1 The on orbit power generating capability 050 1  5 W\051 limits the continuous operation of its high performance processor selected for precision computing The 003ight comput er  although suited well for routine operations is limited in its ability to support the computational requirements of attitude determination and control To address these limitations the computing platform is designed as a distributed system An MSP430 based 003ight computer is in continuous operation and the CMG controller a high performance digital signal processor 050DSP\051  from T e xas Instruments 050TI\051 is operated intermittently to perform attitude operations The precision sensors actuators and complex computing algorithms are interfaced and implemented on the high speed auxiliary processor which is operated only when there is suf\002cient energy in the batteries The health monitoring sensors transceiver and other housekeeping tasks are interfaced and implemented on the 003ight computer which is in operation during the entire mission To facilitate effective operation and telemetry packaging each computing unit is designed to host a storage device The CDH system software is composed of multiple operating modes which are formed by grouping together the low powered housekeeping tasks and the more power intensive computing tasks These operating modes are initiated through the 003ight computer and executed on the auxiliary processor when required The paper describes the design of the distributed computing architecture which includes the design of operating modes handshaking/interface protocol autonomous decision making and ground based communication exchange with the two computing units The operating modes are described through 003owcharts and the data assimilated which forms telemetry packages is presented in the form of tables The autonomous and ground based decision making capabilities are demonstrated in the 003owchart The interface protocol which entails sending and receiving a set number of data bits through the serial peripheral interface 050SPI\051 channel is presented in the form of tables The position and value of each data bit sent for every scenario encountered in the operating modes 003owcharts is described A top-down design approach is adopted to facilitate bottom-up coding and implementation of 003ight software and telemetry formulation 2 D ESIGN OF C OMMAND AND D ATA H ANDLING S YSTEM A CubeSat systems engineering approach which is discussed in References 15 and 16 is used to translate mission objectives/requirements into basic building blocks through a mission mapping process The command and data handling system to support the distributed computing architecture is designed by organizing these basic building blocks through the mission concept of operations 050CONOPS\051 Mission CONOPS facilitates a systematic approach of realizing the mission objectives and is critical for organizing mission operations The mission CONOPS for addressing the distributed operations is summarized as a 003owchart in Fig 2 and the overall software architecture is captured in Fig 3 Upon successful launch and deployment from the P-POD  the CubeSat enters the po wer up and deplo y mode designed as a one time operation for antenna deployment and veri\002cation To date most picoand nano-class CubeSats have been 003own as a secondary payloads and are required to demonstrate the capability of not interfering with the Figure 2  CubeSat Mission CONOPS 2

primary payload communications during the initial minutes of launch A delay is included to halt the CubeSat from initiating any communications for a set period of time The CubeSat enters the safe-hold mode the primary operating mode after the set delay During the safe-hold mode the CubeSat communicates real time telemetry which includes solar cell voltages currents temperatures battery capacity and satellite angular rates to a ground station The real time telemetry 050satellite beacon\051 is designed to relay satellite health and assist ground control in decision making From the safe-hold mode the CubeSat can transfer to any of these four operating modes 050i\051 detumble mode 050ii\051 ADS mode 050iii\051 CMG Ops mode and 050iv\051 Comms mode The detumble mode is primarily designed to stabilize the Cubesat using the magnetic actuators but is also responsible to evaluate the performance of the solar cells by recording their voltage current and temperature The ADS modes is designed to validate the attitude determination system and assist in diagnosing the attitude and inertial sensors on board the satellite During the ADS mode measurements from Sun sensors magnetometer and IMU are fused together for estimating the CubeSat attitude The estimated attitude along with satellite angular rates is stored on board the satellite During the CMG Ops 050Mission Ops\051 mode the primary mission goal of rapid retargeting and precision pointing is demonstrated Similar to the detumble and ADS mode CMG mode data is stored on board the satellite During the Comms mode the mission validating data from the detumble ADS and CMG Ops mode is downlinked to a ground station To facilitate multiple attempts for realizing the mission goal the operating modes can be executed multiple times Among the operating modes discussed in this section the CMG Ops mode and the ADS mode are designed as distributed operations These operations are initiated by the 003ight computer and executed on the auxiliary processor To execute the mission pro\002le shown in Fig 2 the software is designed as operating modes and implemented as software tasks as shown in Fig 3 When the safe-hold mode is in operation the CubeSat is designed to consume about 15  of the power generated from the solar cells The excess power is stored in the Li-Po batteries for use in mission operations The detail design of each operating mode along with their telemetry budget is discussed in the following sections 3 S AFE H OLD O PERATING M ODE A 003owchart illustrating the power-up  deploy mode and the safe-hold mode is shown in Fig 4 The P-POD and the separation switch design enable the CubeSat to be powered on upon its deployment out of the P-POD Once deployed and powered on the 003igh software enters the powerup and deploy operation at the 223Power ON\224 block shown in Fig 4 This block is the starting point for every reboot of the satellite due to insuf\002cient power ground command or a watchdog reset The program communicates with the real time clock 050RTC\051 and records the time as the current boot time on the 003ash storage Along with the boot time the boot counter is also updated on the 003ash storage The boot counter is designed to track the number of times the satellite reboots The antenna deployment operation is designed to be executed only the 002rst time which is tracked through the launch 003ag However a provision is made to attempt partial and/or complete redeployment in case of an unexpected failure The success of antenna deployment is veri\002ed by sensing the change in acceleration and/or satellite angular rates before and after the deployment To protect the primary payload from any potential electromagnetic interference the CubeSat is designed to be idle for 45 minutes after its deployment out of the P-POD After successfully executing the antenna deployment and the wait period the transceiver is powered on and the CubeSat enters safe-hold mode Figure 4  Power-Up  Deploy and Safe-Hold Modes During safe-hold mode the onboard transceiver is powered on and the satellite can be located by a ground station or a hand held operator The safe-hold operating mode is a low power mode designed to validate secondary objectives and facilitate a net positive power generation from the solar cells Real-time satellite health data is transmitted during this operating mode for ground based decisions to switch to another operating mode As indicated in the 003owchart safehold mode is designed as an in\002nite loop unless interrupted by a ground command or a power reset The satellite receiver is in an interrupt mode and can be commanded by a ground station anytime While the satellite is listening for any ground communication via the receiver the 003ight software collects real-time health data from the on board sensors and actively transmits it at speci\002c intervals As shown in Fig 4 the satellite can be commanded into another operating mode through a ground input The 003owcharts describing the safe-hold functions check receiver query beacon transmit beacon and deploy antenna tasks derived from the mission mapping process are included in the Appendix 4 


Safe-hold Mode Downlink Telemetry Each operating mode is associated with a downlink telemetry which is as stated earlier formulated by combining the telemetry overheads associated with the components identi\002ed through the mission mapping process The safe-hold mode downlink telemetry referred to as the satellite beacon is shown in Table 1 Within the limitations of the transceiver  the satellite beacon ef fecti v ely relays its health to assist ground based decisions The data transmitted as part of satellite beacon is shown in Table 1 As shown in the table the hardware column identi\002es the components derived from the mission mapping process and the bits column identi\002es the telemetry overhead associated with these components Table 1  Safe-hold Mode Downlink Telemetry  Quantity H/W

uplink command for each operating mode is in\003uenced by the tasks which are grouped to form the operating mode The uplink command for the safe-hold mode and the speci\002c parameters which can be altered are shown in Table 2 The beacon interval which is in\003uenced by the query beacon task is inversely proportional to the net power consumed by the onboard transceiver and this relationship is utilized for satellite power management By making a provision for varying the beacon interval the satellite can be operated in a 223super\224 safe-hold mode when the power being generated on board the satellite is at its minimum The safe-hold mode uplink command makes provision to attempt re-deployment through the launch 003ag variable and makes provision for resetting satellite power The deploy antenna and verify task in\003uence this parameter within the operating mode 4 D ETUMBLE O PERATING M ODE The detumble operating mode is designed to stabilize the satellite about its three axes Detumble operation is a timed operation and the time period is a function of the variable detumble loop-time as shown in the 003owchart in Fig 5 The operation is a sub routine of the main program and is initiated by a ground command which includes the parameters detumble loop time and a timeout period Since the main goal of the operating mode is to stabilize the angular rates of the satellite the function queries the IMU rates and compares them against prede\002ned threshold values The detumble mode is a relatively power intensive operation compared to the safe-hold mode To ensure the batteries have enough energy for executing the operation the function queries the battery board through the I2C communication link to EPS Based on the predetermined threshold values for angular rates of the satellite and the available power the detumbling task is performed The design makes provision for recording the operation success as a status 003ag in the 003ash storage To detumble the satellite magnetic coils embedded in the solar panels are ener gized by the 003ight computer  A provision is made to terminate the detumble operation from a ground station through the receiver The detumble operation can also terminate autonomously if the angular rates are estimated to be below a threshold To assist the ground command in making decisions to terminate the operation the satellite transmits its health data at speci\002ed intervals Additionally the satellite is programmed to record detumble telemetry into the 003ash storage at speci\002ed intervals The recorded data is transmitted during the Comms operation The 003owcharts describing the safe-hold functions record telemetry and energizing the magnetic coils tasks derived from the mission mapping process are included in the Appendix Detumble mode downlink telemetry The downlink telemetry for the detumble operating mode validates the capability of the magnetic coils embedded in the solar panels to detumble the CubeSat and execute the secondary mission objectives The satellite autonomously terminate the detumble operation in the case of a successful stabilization or insuf\002cient power To perform a ground analysis of the detumble operation and its termination the satellite angular rates are recorded from the IMU as part of the downlink telemetry The power generation capacity of solar cells has been researched by several CubeSat missions and traditional satellites Solar cell voltages currents and temperatures are included as part of the detumble telemetry to analyze the power generation capacity of the CubeSat in a spinning state Battery characteristics are included in 5
