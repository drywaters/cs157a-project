When correlated with a specific condition a mechanical fault has a precursor signature same as an incipient fault with an electrical origin These mechanical faults or conditions include specific problems such as mechanical wear bearing aging and lubricant contamination environmental contributors thermal anomalies or faults preceded by patterns in wind speed and direction degraded/failed sensors and degradation of mechanical and electronic interconnects These techniques help substantially increase component reliability margins and system availability goals while reducing through improved root cause analysis costly troubleshooting-diagnosis-repair cycles that are a significant cost issue for many of these systems A particular challenge in setting the prognostic trigger point is the avoidance of false-alarms detection too early in system's lifetime and avoidance of late notifications While the sensors used to acquire SoH information may be both diagnostic and prognostic neither sensor type provides a prediction of when the failure is likely to occur One predictive analysis methodology collects sensor data from many sources and conditions the collected data to enable probabilistic calculations including Bayesian calculations Bayesian calculations can be quite complex especially when many variables are involved After data fusion it is necessary to run a multiplicity of calculations to predict the likelihood of failure of one of the power subsystems within a specified period Accordingly accurate prediction also requires collection conditioning and processing of increasingly complex and massive sets of data A key benefit of the Ridgetop Electronic Prognostics Platform is the use of collected information to calculate system RUL There are several techniques employed for such estimates including analysis of actual operands and measurands existing diagnostic output vectors prognostic sensors and canaries Data from the constellation of these inputs is collected and fused Algorithms yield composite estimates of system health at a particular level within the system hierarchy The algorithms available include adaptive model-based reasoners RSET Bayesian network reasoners and others With a platform available for quick analysis various options can be explored For example at the board and module levels a Built-In Self-Test BIST identifies and isolates faults as well as providing predictive capability of impending failures Emphasis is placed on reducing false alarms and identifying prognostic techniques to anticipate system degradation and allow automated recovery This prognostic approach provides an accurate picture of forthcoming faults and component degradation the predictive indicators of failure and is extremely useful to the crew The solution also allows timely action needed to avoid costly or catastrophic damage to critical Line Replaceable Units LRUs and to maintain availability/readiness rates for weapon systems ACTUATOR PROGNOSTICS Prognostic techniques initially developed by Ridgetop for Switch-Mode Power Supplies SMPS are applicable to electronic sub-systems such as the actuator driver in a brushless DC motor system The brushless DC motor uses permanent magnets attached to a rotor in place of the armature windings in a conventional DC motor Field winding are driven by a multi-phase generally three phase commutation signal that uses a power drive stage similar to topologies in DC-to-DC power converters Typically three Hall sensors detect rotor position Commutation is based on the Hall sensor inputs Two alternative approaches for positioning feedback are 1 taking the back EMF directly from the windings and 2 using an optical sensor for precise position feedback A microprocessor is generally required to convert position feedback and motion profiles into a commutation signal The DC brushless motor is common in industrial applications requiring higher performance and reliability This is due to the motor's brush-free operation linear current/torque relationship smoother acceleration and clean spark-free operation Figure 7 State Diagram of a Motor/Actuator System Close-Loop DC A closed loop system consisting of an actuator and a position sensing feedback loop Figure 7 tracks position with a preset motion profile The system acts as a transfer function responding to perturbations in either set position or motor torque Critical components windings power switches sensors and microprocessor exhibit fault-tofailure progression signatures manifesting in the transfer function of the control loop The non-invasive prognostic detector is an impulse either in the motion profile or the load torque and data register to record the recovery waveform for position angular speed or force output A first-order analysis compares the captured waveform of a suspect motion system against a baseline signature recorded on a new system Deviations from the baseline suggest an anomaly has been observation of an anomaly 5

The costs of applying prognostics can be separated into three categories  Non-recurring engineering NRE cost of adding the prognostics to an actuator  Per unit costs of the prognostic components  False Alarm Cost if failure rate of the prognostic circuitry approaches the failure rate of the component being monitored In reference 9 it was shown that ROI for prognosticsenabling high efficiency power converters can be up to 20 and is often significantly higher Separately Sun Microsystems found that proper adoption of electronic prognostics to their Blade servers reduced their NTF rates from over 50O to less than 10%.3 Missed Opportunity the VWPassat Example Due to the high cost and complexity involved in purchasing financing and servicing aircraft ROI is often difficult to assess A more accessible but equally compelling case can be made examining the recent recall and on-going National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA probe of the VW Passat An investigation began in May 2007 revealed there had been 78 reports of engine fires and two injuries involved with the VW Passat Specifically the Passat sedans from the 2000-2003 model year equipped with 4and 6-cylinder engines The engine fires are attributed to failure of the ignition coil 10 Table 1 Statistical Data for VW Passat Recall 11 Total Units Affected Recalled Units Failure Incidents to date Failure Cause LRU Warranty Claims LRU Cost Unit Cost Low Unit Cost High Unit Cost Average 352,668 345,642 12 78 Ignition Coil 14850 173.76 21,750 31,575 26,662 Before calculating ROI an estimate is required for the recall cost Factors affecting the recall cost include  LRUs per unit  Labor cost per hour  Labor time  Recall administrative cost per unit 3 Gross K Sun Microsystems Electronic Prognostics Experience NDIA Conference 2006 Miami Florida These factors are the primary assumptions needed to make the recall cost calculation Table 2 Recall Cost Assumptions LRUs per unit 1 Labor cost per hour 100 Labor time per unit 1 hour Recall administrative cost per unit 150 With these factors identified and can be calculated estimated the recall cost Recall Cost per unit  423.76 Recall Cost total  146,469,254 With a 500K investment cost as the price for a corporate prognostics IP license the ROI calculation is ROI  146,620,960 500,000  500,000  292 Not bad for an investment of 0.71 per unit car particularly when weighted against an estimated 423.76 recall cost per car which does not take into account inestimable values such as customer satisfaction investor confidence and positive brand recognition While damage to these somewhat nebulous values is hard to assess it's not hard at all to track and tally the losses incurred by businesses suffering from defect-related set-backs For VW a faulty component with a failure rate of 0.02 occurring in 78 cars resulted in the recall of 346,000 cars or 96.l1 of all cars manufactured over a four-year period Or to put it in another way 13,000 approximately one case of defective ignition coils cost the company 146.6 million dollars That comes out to 1.9 million dollars per defective ignition coil One benefit yet to be mentioned of a successful electronic prognostics deployment is the reduction in the very defects and failures that are the root causes of a product buy-backs refunds product returns and recall campaigns These ROI calculation demonstrate the tremendous gains possible through a modest investment as well as the cost of missed opportunities Electronic prognostics are one of those rare value-added propositions customers can easily understand and justify when couched in terms of improved quality performance and maintenance reductions SUMMARY This paper shows the efficacy of using electronic prognostics on actuator drive systems used in commercial and mil-aero systems Electronic prognostics can be linked to larger networks to provide a dynamically updated inventory of assets indicating state-of-health and remaining 9 1-1 li 1

  12 the PL is intended to fulfill, thus many requirements and specifications that would be found in a PL design specification would need to be provided by the specific PL procurement agency. The ORS Phase III standards can be downloaded from http://projects.nrl.navy.mil/busstandards  Communications Interfaces  A key external interface for th e space segment \(bus and PL is RF communications to the ground. This topic investigated standardization for SC command and control \(C&C communications link and the tactical communication link Figure 11 presents a basic high-level view of the RF communications pathways envisioned in the standards Other issues investigated related to both current and future approaches the military is planning for RF communications including, data flow, frequency band definitions modulation techniques, data rates, communication security COMSEC\and basic defi nition of ground interface locations. Given the current maturity of the general military SC C&C network, the presen t SGLS architecture and the expected Unified S-Band \(USB\architecture were established as the standard. Fo r the tactical links, standard UHF was established for LDR application, and the Common Data Link \(CDL\ocol was established as the HDR standard Ground Support Checkout Interface In support of the rapid call-up scenario, standards for interfacing spacecraft bus and the payload, and processing the integrated space vehicle though launch, is one of the unique activities under the IS ET derived ORS system design. The need to develop an approach for this effort in sufficient detail in order to derive requirements that would influence the spacecraft bus design is critical. The approaches developed have design and manufacturing ramification on the bus, such as the ability to install batteries late in the flow, rapid \223built-in-test\224 capabilities periodic checks, and access a nd safety implications Data Interfaces: Bus to Payload and Ground This document defines the data exchange protocols, data transport formats, packet definitions and field definitions for the bus/PL interface. Underlying electrical interface for the bus/PL interface is the HDLC and SpaceWire. The bus/PL interface is defined such that the HDLC interface SpaceWire interface, or both can be used. The bus design will provide support for both interfaces. The PL may choose to implement either one or both. The bus/PL interface is defined to dynamically suppor t either or both interfaces without needing bus reconfiguration \(i.e., FSW changes This document also defines the data exchange protocols data transport and packet template for the space/ground interface. The space to ground interface definition assumes the use of a flight side SGLS transponder integrated with COMSEC slices. The SGLS forward link assumes a flightside Cardholder COMSEC slice. The SGLS return link  Figure 11 Radio Frequency Communications Architecture  


  13 assumes that the SGLS transponder supports both the narrow-band and wide-band inte rfaces. While a return link COMSEC is required, this document assumes that the return link COMSEC does not levy any blocking or packaging constraints for the return link This interface standard was developed as part of the ORS Phase 3 Bus effort. This interface standard was adopted by the ORS Phase 3 Bus and COMMx payload elements. As a result, the TACSAT-4 spacecraft implemented the encl osed interface standards for its bus to payload and space to ground interfaces This document is limited to and currently defines the interfaces between the spacecraf t bus and the payload, and between the spacecraft bus and the ground. Subsequent releases will define the add itional internal interfaces. The depth of detail required for in terface standardization and the need for coverage of additional interfaces is an ongoing assessment effort by ORS s upported standards definition efforts. The intent is to levy interface standards where these standards will lead to efficien t system integration, robust operational capabilities, and improved system flexibility while reducing overall system cost 4  C ONCLUSION  Both the STP-SIV and the ORS ISET efforts have developed standards that provide options for cost-effective capable, flexible spaceflight. Pathfinder SC buses are currently in development for both efforts and will have flight heritage within approximately one year Through the efforts of ISET and the associate prototype teams, the ORS program ha s successfully produced an extensive and well-documented set of ORS bus standards consistent with the ORS concept of operations \(CONOPS and classes of missions. The process used to produce these standards has resulted in technically sound standards which are understood, with buy in from industry. Business factors were also strongly considered to improve the transition of these standards into successful acquisition under a subsequent operational phase While ORS must provide the business foundation, these technical standards are intended to be more broadly useful in order to further volume production, standards acceptance, and the industry business cases. The ORS standards are readily available to Government organizations and payload developers SDTW employs lessons learned from decades of space flight to standardization of STP-SIV design. Flexibility is planned from the beginning and missions are adapted within the range of the SC\222s capability. Development of SC standards requires upfront investment in order to achieve a return on investment once multiple missions have been built and flown. The more PL provi ders who are willing to adopt the STP-SIV interfaces and deve lop experiments applicable to the capabilities of the SC the more successful this program will become R EFERENCES   National Research Council The Role of Small Satellites in NASA and NOAA Earth Observation Programs National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 2000  G F Squibb, \223Meeting the Needs of the Space Technology Industry,\224 ISO Focus, Oct 2005   T.

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.
