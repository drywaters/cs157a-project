Based on this case study, hands-on labs can be developed for teaching web security software security testing, and other topics  I  I NTRODUCTION  Web applications today are highly functional and rel y upon a two-way flow of information between the server and browser. Security becomes a big issue because no one wants to use a web application if they believe their information will be disclosed to unauthorized parties 1   V ul n e ra b i l i t i e s  commonly found in web applications include injection crosssite scripting cross-site request forgery security misconfiguration broken authentication and session management, and more Penetration testing and static code analysis may be used to assess the vulnerabilities of web applications Penetration testing is a method of security testing through the simulation of an attack  Static code analysis also known as source code 000D\000Q\000D\000O\000\\\000V\000L\000V\000\003\000L\000V\000\003\000D\000\003\000F\000R\000G\000H\000\003\000U\000H\000Y\000L\000H\000Z\000\003\000S\000U\000R\000F\000H\000V\000V\000\003\000W\000K\000D\000W\000\003\000H\000[\000D\000P\000L\000Q\000H\000V\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003\000V\000R\000I\000W\000Z\000D\000U\000H\000∂\000V\000\003 source code for common coding errors and defects without execution [3    This case study uses an example web application Tunestore to conduct security testing It illustrates web application security testing using tools and manual testing.

A more detailed discussion can be found in [6   SQL injection is a vulnerability type where an application accepts malicious scripts that are later parsed and executed The fundamental way of attack involves the direct insertion of code into user-input variables that are concatenated with SQL commands and executed A rare and indirect way of attack is where the malicious code is injected into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as metadata Subsequently when the stored string is concatenated into a dynamic SQL command the malicious code is executed  An attacker can anonymously read and modify data contained in a database as well as take full control of the server by exploiting the SQL vulnerability An  application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting XSS vulnerabilities when it takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation and escaping This allows attackers to embed malicious JavaScript VBScript ActiveX, HTML or Flash into a dynamic page to trick the user executing the script on his machine in order to gather data  hijack sessions, redirect users to a malicious site or deface the website  Furthermore  a successful attack m ay  result in the compromising of private information, manipulation or theft of cookies, creation of requests that can be mistaken for those of a This work is partially supported by Department of Education under grant P120A090049 and NSF under grant HRD 1137516.

valid user. It might also cause the execution of malicious code on the end user systems Three types of XSS exist The first one is Reflected XSS in which dynamic web pages take text submitted by a client or user and simply renders this text back to user within its response. The second type is Stored XSS. It occurs where some malicious user-submitted data is stored in a database to be used in the creation of pages that will be served to other users later. Thus visitors of the web page fall victim for this attack. Lastly, Local XSS exploit targets vulnerabilities that exist within the webpage code itself. Usually, this happens when Document Object Model DOM is wrongly used in JavaScript As a result opening another web page with malicious JavaScript code in it at the same time might actually alter the code in the first page on the local system Broken authentication and session management is the vulnerability whereby the application does not implement its authentication and session management functions correctly The attacker uses leaks or flaws such as exposed accounts session IDs and passwords in the authentication or session management function to impersonate users When successful an attacker is able to do anything the victim could do The situation worsens when the administrator is the victim Cross-site request forgery usually occurs where HTTP cookies are primarily used to transmit session tokens Where precaution is not taken against the misuse of the token an attacker can trick an authenticated user to perform actions of his \(attacker\ choosing. Victims are forced to change data and perform functions they are allowed or authorized to do Insecure direct object reference is a common web application vulnerability regarding access control This occurs when an application wrongfully exposes a reference to an internal implementation object An attacker usually an authorized user, exploits this vulnerability by simply changing a parameter value that references a system object. This enables him to access unauthorized objects III  T OOLS U SED IN THE C ASE S TUDY  This section briefly describes the tools used in this case study which are Paros WebScarab JBroFuzz Acunetix and Fortify A  Paros Paros [7  i s  a  f r e e  w e b  a p pl i c a t i o n v u l n e ra b i l i t y  a s s e s s m e nt  tool written in Java by ProofSecure.com It can be used as a web spider, vulnerability scanner, proxy, and a fuzzer. The web spider function is used to discover the content of a website by parsing a webpage for links to other content, requesting these pages and continuing this process recursively The scanner function scans the web application to identify common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting SQL injection forms with autocomplete enabled old versions of files etc Paros can also trap HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses so they can be modified manually [1    B  WebScarab WebScarab 9 i s  a n o pe n s o u r c e  w e b  a p pl i c a t i o n s e c u ri t y  testing tool written in Java. The tool is a part of the Open Web Application Security Project \(OWASP\[10  I t  c a n  b e  us e d  f o r  analyzing applications that communicate with HTTP and HTTPS protocols WebScarab operates as an intercepting proxy in which the user is allowed to review and modify intercepted requests that are created by the browser and responses from the server. Similar to Paros, it can be used as a web spider to discover the content of a website The fuzzer feature of WebScarab allows a user to test a web page by taking a list of test strings and trying them in the input fields automatically [1    C  JBroFuzz  JBroFuzz is a web application fuzzer written in Java and is a part of the OWASP Project. The fuzzer is for requests made over HTTP and HTTPS protocols [12  T h e  f uz z i ng f e a t u r e  i s  used to create a HTTP request to send to the web application A fuzzer can be added to a parameter field to add attack payloads The payload feature has attack strings of several vulnerability categories such as Injection XSS Integer Overflow, XPATH Injection, SQL Injection, and more. HTTP responses are displayed in an output window showing the payload and the HTTP response status code. The responses of the web application to the attack strings are also shown. The graphing feature can generate different types of graphs to visualize the fuzzing results There are six types of graphs/charts Status Code Pie Chart Response Time Bar Chart Response Size Bar Chart Jaccard Index Hamming Distance, and Response Header D  Acunetix  Acunetix is a product of the Acunetix Company [1   I t  i s  a  000Z\000H\000E\000\003 000Y\000X\000O\000Q\000H\000U\000D\000E\000L\000O\000L\000W\000\\\000\003 000V\000F\000D\000Q\000Q\000H\000U\000\003 000F\000U\000H\000D\000W\000H\000G\000\003 000W\000R\000\003 000U\000H\000S\000O\000L\000F\000D\000W\000H\000\003 000K\000D\000F\000N\000H\000U\000∂\000V\000\003 methodologies to find vulnerabilities in web applications Acunetix crawls through the websites to analyze the content including flash content SOAP and AJAX The scanner includes features such as advanced and in-depth SQL injection and cross-site scripting testing penetration tools which include HTTP Editor and HTTP Fuzzer, and others. The cost of the tool ranges from 1,000  12,995 It has a free trial version that can only scan for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in a web application. In this case study, the free trial version was used to test the example web application E  Fortify  Fortify is a static analysis tool used to find root causes of security vulnerabilities in source code Fortify supports a range of languages platforms build environments and software component APIs Fortify can detect more than 480 types of software security vulnerabilities among 20 different languages.

However, a bug in the tool was discovered. For some valid SQL i nj ection attack strings JBroFuzz generated invalid requests to the web application and thus could not identify the SQL injection vulnerability Because of this bug JBroFuzz was no longer used to test for other vulnerabilities in the Tunestore web application However the payloads embedded in JBroFuzz were used in manual testing to discover some of the vulnerabilities in Tunestore Using Acunetix \(free edition\, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were discovered VI  M ANUAL T ESTING  Using manual testing authentication access control injection cross-site scripting cross-site request forgery and integer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered Some of the vulnerabilities confirm those found through automated tools Others were not reported by the tools   The vulnerabilities found through manual testing which confirm those reported by the automated tools are the following x-none 000x  SQL Injection 000  This allows illegitimate users to login as a legitimate user  x-none 000x  Reflected Cross Site Scripting 000  Malicious scripts may be injected into input fields of the login page and be executed  x-none 000x  Stored Cross Site Scripting 000  0008\000V\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000:\000H\000E\0006\000F\000D\000U\000D\000E\000∂\000V\000\003 proxy feature, a malicious script can be stored in the comment field  Using manual testing, we were able to confirm some of the vulnerabilities reported by some of the tool.

It can be used to demonstrate various web application vulnerabilities to the students. Limited by our academic environment, we do not have the full versions of Fortify and Acunetix Therefore the testing results from the demonstration or the trial version of the tools are very limited in this study. Universities can apply for the Hewlett-Packard Company Educational Software License Agreement to receive the full version of Fortify for free for educational purposes.  However, we could not get the full version of Fortify because our university did not agree  with the user agreement for the license for the Fortify software  The web spidering and proxy features of Paros and WebScarab are very useful for web application testing The web spidering functions allow testers to understand the content and structure of the web application. The proxy allows testers to intercept and modify requests and responses transmitted between the client and server to conduct attacks The scanner feature of Paros is quite limited It does report some main vulnerabilities such as SQL injection cross-s ite scripting and s 000H\000V\000V\000L\000R\000Q\000\003 000,\000'\000\003 000L\000Q\000\003 0008\0005\000/\000\003 000U\000H\000Z\000U\000L\000W\000H\000\017\000\003 000H\000W\000F\000\021\000\003 000:\000H\000E\0006\000F\000D\000U\000D\000E\000∂\000V\000\003 fuzzer feature can be very useful because a large number of attack strings can be submitted to test the application automatically Some of the manual testing conducted in this case study such as testing for buffer overflow integer overflow vulnerabilities could have been done using 000:\000H\000E\0006\000F\000D\000U\000D\000E\000∂\000V\000\003 000I 000 000H 000U 000\003 000I 000H 000D 000W 000X 000U 000H 000\021 000\003 000\000 000U 000R 000 000X\000 000 000\003 000G\000R 000H 000V 000\003 not have good documentation on how to use the tool From our use of the tool, we discovered a bug in the tool, and did not think the tool worked properly as it is supposed to However the attack types and payloads embedded in the tool can be useful The payloads can be used for manual testing or testing with 000:\000H\000E\0006\000F\000D\000U\000D\000E\000∂\000V\000\003\000I 000 000H 000U\000\003 000I 000H 000D 000W 000X 000U 000H 000\021  Manual testing discovered most of the vulnerabilities especially the design flaws Some of them are the same as those found using Paros, Fortify, Acunetix, for example, SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities Most of the authentication and access control vulnerabilities can only be 000I\000R\000X\000Q\000G\000\003 000W\000K\000U\000R\000X\000J\000K\000\003 000P\000D\000Q\000X\000D\000O\000\003 000W\000H\000V\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\003 000E\000D\000V\000H\000G\000\003 000R\000Q\000\003 000W\000H\000V\000W\000H\000U\000∂\000V\000\003 000R\000E\000V\000H\000U\000Y\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000V\000\021\000\003 Therefore it is important to utilize a variety of tools as well as conduct careful manual testing in order to find the most number of vulnerabilities in a web application VIII  C ONCLUSION  This paper describes a case study of testing for security vulnerabilities of an example application 000  Tunestore It provides an overview of web application security testing tools such as Paros, WebScarab, JBroFuzz, Acunetix, and Fortify.

a Total job execution times in 4 nodes cluster          b Total job execution times in 8 nodes cluster Figure 4 TeraSort benchmark evaluation HDD From Figure 4\(b we observe that with two HDDs per node our design achieves an improvement of 31 over Hadoop-A 32 Gbps          Figure 5 TeraSort benchmark evaluation with larger sort size We have also evaluated TeraSort with larger sized cluster In this case we have varied the sort size from 100 GB to 200 GB with 12 and 24 compute nodes in the cluster respectively Figure 5 shows these results For 100 GB sort size we achieve 41 beneìt over IPoIB 32Gbps and 7 beneìt over Hadoop-A 32Gbps For 200 GB sort size also we achieve similar beneìts From Figure 4 and Figure 5 we observe that Hadoop-A performs better with respect to IPoIB in a bigger cluster with the same sort size whereas our implementation achieves better performance in both cases compared to Hadoop-A As in our setup storage nodes have twice as much memory as compute nodes our implementation has more beneìts in storage nodes compared to those in compute nodes This clearly depicts the efìciency of the caching mechanism implemented in our design Figure 7 Sort benchmark evaluation with SSD Figure 6\(a shows the performance results of the Sort benchmark using four DataNodes For this we have used four compute nodes in our cluster Each DataNode has single HDD per node In this case our design reduces the job execution time by 26 over IPoIB 32 Gbps and 38 over Hadoop-A for 20 GB sort From Figure 6\(b we observe that with eight DataNodes our design can achieve an improvement of 27 over IPoIB 32 Gbps and 32 over Hadoop-A Compared with the TeraSort benchmark the difference in the Sort benchmark is the variable size of the key-value pairs In Sort the combined length of key-value pairs can be as large as 20,000 bytes From the results we can observe that Hadoop-A performs worse than IPoIB even after conìguring all the tunable parameters with optimum values as mentioned in Hadoop-A release It re v eals that only substituting the socket based communication with the native IB verbs some applications such as the Sort benchmark cannot get better performance due to the inefìciency in number of keyvalue pairs transferred each time that also affects proper overlapping between all the stages Our design with the efìcient caching mechanism can get better performance in 
We perform the regular Sort benchmark in 1 GigE IPoIB 32 Gbps with vanilla Hadoop and Hadoop-A and compare the results with our design For this experiment the optimal value of HDFS block-size is 64 MB We have used RandomWriter to generate the input data for the Sort benchmark

In our design we have implemented efìcient map output pre-fetching and caching mechanism We have also provided a conìguration parameter to enable/disable the caching In this experiment we have evaluated the performance improvement that we can get through caching enabled

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rollingÖ I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todayís cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlightís data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlightís hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlightís method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
