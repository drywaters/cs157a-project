We can also see that our approach has achieved a rate of rejection in some cases with sharing of resources smaller than the rate of rejection of Calheiros approach in the case without sharing For example with the rst input ow regular ow and with 50 MVs Calheiros approach has rejected more than 36 of requests received in the case without sharing while our rejected rate is less than 36 in the case of sharing with 5 MVs affected Also with the second ow and 50 MVs Calheiros has rejected in the case without sharing more than 30.5 of received requests while our rate of rejection is less than of 30.5 in the case of sharing and with 5 MVs affected The same gain is more visible with the results of 100 MVs where we can see that the rejection rate of our approach in the case of sharing and with 40 MVs affected 0.1 with the regular ow and 0.2 with the random ow is smaller than the rate of rejection of Calheiros in the case without sharing 4 with the regular ow and 1 with the random ow Fig 5 Rate of rejected requests regular ow with 50 VMs Fig 6 Average response time regular ow with 50 VMs By cons where the vast majority of virtual machines are affected by degradation the Calheiros strategy proved more effective however such cases must be very rare with the use of placement policies of virtual machines in the Clouds V C ONCLUSION In this paper we proposed a new load balancing policy that takes into account the interference of performance which may affect the QoS of virtual machines in the Clouds Our proposal was more scalable and could signi“cantly reduce the rate of rejected requests in both cases with and without resource sharing We have shown that it is possible to reduce the rate of rejected requests through optimal use of capacities of virtual machines and we were able to mitigate the degradations of some virtual machines using other non-affected virtual machines without creating an additional burden However we intend to complete this work by the introduction of a policy to predict the evolution of the intensity of ow of requests to dynamically obtain the appropriate number of instances to create or maintain to meet the desired QoS Fig 7 Rate of rejected requests regular ow with 100 VMs Fig 8 Average response time regular ow with 100 VMs

Crowne is a member of the Senior Professional Staff of the RF Engineering group in JHU/APL\222s Space Department. He received his B.S from Johns Hopkins University in 2000 and his M.S. from the same university in 2009, both in electrical engineering Matthew joined JHU/APL in 2007 where he has been working on the development of radios for spaceflight communications systems. Prior to joining JHU/APL, he worked for Integrated Defense Systems Inc., where he developed solid state power amplifiers for electronic warfare and communication systems. Matthew was the integration and test lead for the Van Allen Probes RF communication system and is currently working on the Solar Probe Plus mission   Dipak K. Srinivasan is the supervisor of the RF Systems Engineering Section in the JHU/APL Space Department. He received his B.S. and M.Eng. in electrical engineering in 1999 and 2000 in electrical engineering from Cornell University, and an M.S. in applied physics from The Johns Hopkins University in 2003. Dipak joined the APL Space Department in 2000, where he has served as the lead RF Integration and Test Engineer for the CONTOUR and MESSENGER spacecraft and lead mission system verification engineer for the New Horizons project. He is currently the Lead RF Telecommunications Systems Engineer for the MESSENGER and Van Allen Probes missions and chairs technical sessions at the annual International Astronautical Congress  Darryl W. Royster is a member of the Senior Professional Staff in the RF Engineering Group at JHU/APL.  He led compatibility testing for the Van Allen Probes, STEREO, and MESSENGER missions.  Previously he was the System Engineer for the Satellite Communications Facility at JHU/ APL and the lead RF Integration and Test Engineer for the STEREO spacecraft.  Prior to joining the JHI/APL Space Department in 2001, Mr. Royster designed cellular and land mobile radio products for Ericsson, GE and Motorola.  He received his B.S. and M.S. in electrical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1982 and 1984, respectively  Gregory L. Weaver joined the Senior Professional Staff of JHU/APL in 2003 and works within the RF Engineering Group of the Space Department.  He is a technologist with extensive background in the technical and business aspects of the frequency control industry and has held positions as a senior design engineer, technical manager and marketing strategist over a 25 year career history, including vice president positions with Bliley Technologies Inc. and the former Piezo Crystal Company. He received his M.S in Technology Management from the University of Pennsylvania in 1993 and his B.S. in Physics from Dickinson College in 1982.  He is a licensed professional engineer in the state of Pennsylvania, member of the IEEE and the UFFC Societ y.  He has contributed to the technical proceedings of the IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium, Precise Time and Time Interval Systems and Application Meeting and the European Frequency and Time Forum   


  13 Daniel Matlin is an Associate Professional Staff at JHU/APL and a member of the RF engineering group in the Space department.  He went through a dual Bachelors/Masters program at Johns Hopkins University graduating with his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 2008 and his Masters of Science in Engineering from the Electrical Engineering department in 2009.  As a student he specialized in RF systems design.  Mr. Matlin started at the JHU/APL in February of 2010 and in his short time with the lab has been privileged to work on various tasks supporting the RBSP program, including supporting a successful launch and early operations.  Mr. Matlin assisted in the qualification testing for the flight DSP slices as well as the integrated flight transceivers.  He also carried out electrical testing and flight qualification of the newly designed Hypertronics stacking connectors as well as components and cables used for the RF subsystem  Nelli Mosavi is an EMC and RF Engineer in the JHU/APL Space Department, RF Systems Engineering section. She received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Oakland University Michigan in 2004 and an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from The Johns Hopkins University in 2010. She is currently working toward her Ph.D. at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. She joined APL in 2009 and has since been working on RF and EME issues on the Van Allen Probes mission. Nelli previously worked for SENTEL Corporation, General Motors, DENSO International, and Molex Automotive
