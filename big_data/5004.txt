Smart City Dashboard for Integrating Various Data of Sensor Network s                   Abstract 200 Urban growth may lead to various problems The increasing number of citizens at urban areas may lead the i ncr easing of demand such as new residential  public health public transport  A city require basic infrastructure such as educational facilities housing clean water sanit ation solid waste electricity telecommunications and so on In the socio economi c level the increasing of city residents must be supplied with availability of jobs A city must be managed and planned well to handle problems such as traffic congestion  air quality water quality water supply energy supplies  and public health quality and so on  At this paper we proposed tool using information technology and communication ICT to help local government to monitoring what currently happened in the city We proposed application for monitoring city in single dashboard to help summarize t he current condition of city. The architecture system use network sensor consisting of sensor nodes that has function to capture city condition like temperature, air pollution water pollution traffic situation Also we can add another information socio e conomic situation like public health service economic indicator energy supplies etc We have successfully developed the prototype of the smart city dashboard the give m ore accurate information of Bandung City, one of big cities in Indonesia  Keywords 200 ne twork sensor, monitoring, smart city, internet I INTRODUCTION T he increasing numbers of population in urban or city areas create high demand and cause new problems 1  The problem like d ifficulty in waste management, scarcity o f resources, air pollution human health concerns traffic congestions and inadequate deteriorating and aging infrastructures are among the more basic technical physical and material problems 1  Urban areas always needs ba sic infrastructure such as educational facilities housing clean water sanitation solid waste, electricity and telecommunications and so o n Some of the problems occurred mostly in the cities such as 267 The complexity of urban transport and congestion pr oblems 267 Health care issues 267 Waste management, especially in big cities 267 Environment issues such as air quality water supply and quality, etc 267 Disaster may occur in urban area such as floods landslides, etc Some disasters such as floods can be caused by poo r city planning  Problems caused from cities always related with mul tiple and diverse stakeholders 1  So I nformation technology and communication \(ICT can be empowered to help to manage the city  ICT can be empowered to moni tor and record what happens at some specific city area to be reported and acted upon With ICT assistance some problems can be re corded quickly and find the solutions as soon as possible Thus the city situation will be more easily to monitor manage and create some decisions  The stakeholder of this system is not only for the local government but also urban community can also monitor and participate at what happening in a city Some studies associated it with smart city  In some perspective smart city relies on a collection of smart computing technologies applied to ICT infrastructure 2  Smart computing can reflect technology of integrated hardware software and network with real time awareness of the real world From the results it can be evaluated by advanced analytics to help stakeholder decide more intelligent decisions and do some actions that will optimize business function 2  Smart City could be defined as city that can predict and a ccommodate the citizens need  Implementation of ICT technology to make the city smarter could be done in areas such as transport, health and other public services. Smart City concept can be supported at the highest levels of city government and has contrib uted to the daily needs of citizens 3  For a smart city, all activities related to public services can be managed by developing a platform dashboard for monitoring all relevant data V isualization of data can result a varie ty of indicators, where stakeholders can make decision in the city planning or city managing 3  4  Monitoring the city conditions can be done with sensor networks Sensors can be placed at certai n places to capture important data Wireless Sensor Networking WSN solutions for Smart Cities are being driven by standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBe and other standards  From previous work, we have developed part of smart city concept consist of t o monitor environmental and disaster early 


warning system 5  In this paper we extend the research for all basic need monitoring visualize d on single dashboard II RELATED RESEARCH System with the I nformation and communication technology ICT can help provide accurate and precise information about city situation The problems such as transportation congestion health education environment waste water air quality and disaster could be identified earlier  The concept of smart city usually integrated with use of information and communication technology ICT infrastructure especially for monitoring managem ent and decision making tool 4  The implementation of smart city may various depend on the need on each city Some big cities in the world has started to implement Smart City Project such as Amsterdam 6  Lyon 7  Santader 8  Endesas 9  Aarhus 10 and many others Amsterdam is one of big city that has successfully implemented smart city like in Fig 1  Fig 1 A msterdam Smart City 6 Some of important information of city could be summarized into dashboard like in Fig 2 11  Information about weather, forecasting air pollution, river level, economic indicator such as stock, station, traffic condition are displayed in single dashboard 11  This useful information could be used for stakeholders to get information more accurately faste r and then make some decision s  Fig 2 Sample of City Dashboard 11 III SYSTEM DESIGN At this section we describe about the system design We begin with an over view of system architect ure We also describe about the integration network sensor into TCP/IP network with certain communication protocol  A Architecture The architecture for monitoring city could be seen at Fig 3  The system consists of network sensors server and internet network Network sensors are collection of sensors placed in certain place for specific purpose The sensors have main function for data collecting The data from sensor are sent to server via Remote Terminal Unit RTU   S erver can be equipped with a database or GIS Geographical Information System features The connection between network sensor and server use internet or TCP/IP network. In the server side, it can use cloud computing infrastructure The da ta transmiss ion can be done using gateway or using Telecommunication network such as GPRS Some researches also successfully developed radio transmitting to send data using GPRS radio 12  18  B Integrating Ne twork Sensor into internet To interconnect between network sensor with the server and the users it can be used internet Internet can be used as basic network underlying because mostly network hardware support with IP Based C Communication Protocol As prev ious work we have proposed communication protocol to integrating network sensor into internet 19 7  20  Based on our basic design the sensors must report periodic ally to the server via network.  The commonly network used are internet or TCP/IP network based From previous work we have already defined the basis of Finite Time Response \(FTR Protocol as follow 20  356 355 354 263D D    0  1 1 MaxTRrif MaxTRrif P i i i 1 1  i P  Next mode at next duty cycle period \(i+1 It has only 2 values consist of 0 or 1 267 0 indicates that at the next duty cycle period node must be entering on sleep mode force sleep  It means that node isn\200t allowed to send data at some period 267 1 indicates that at the next duty cycle period node allowed to transmit data to server i r D  Response time at duty cycle period i second MaxTR  Parameter of maximum response time allowed sec ond 


Note that we defined force sleep as a period when a node entering phase of postpone to send data for several time At this paper we defined the duration of force sleep not only single duty cycle period only, but we can define as follow TKT FS D  FS T  Duration for force sleep period second K  Constant multiplier to indicate duration of force sleep T D  Duration for single duty cycle time  \(second The duration of sleep  force sleep is K times of duty cycle Note that we use parameter K as control parameter to achieve level of performance. We can describe that parameter K can control the average performance like average response time The ba sic function of this method is to maintain performance always on the certain value. We need to balance between the performance like average response time end to end delay energy efficiency and also periodic updating to server Fig 3 Architecture of Network Sensor to monitor city situation and condition D User Application The system provides application for the users The summaries of city could be displayed on single dashboard Data from various sensors are collected and reco rded in databases Then the last value can be displayed in dashboard  Users can find information about current condition of the city from this dashboard application The results from sensor reading also can be displayed on dashboard application IV RESULT AN D DISCUSSION The application of sensor network applications for city monitoring has implemented into city dashboard application like in Fig 4  The project was implemented on Bandung, one of big city in Indonesia As a big city Bandung has grown very fast. Bandung has many problems and many situations that need to be monitor or controlling The number of citizen the number of vehicle the number of housing and industry must be controlled and monitored Users of a pplication can monitor the condition of the city such as temperature humidity  traffic situation current public service status  


Fig 4 Sample of Smart City Dashboard Application It is prototype proj ect with small number of sensor. In this pilot project we set that our system can implement with any kind type of sensor. It done well with configuration of Remote Terminal Unit when only receive signal in voltage only. At the future, we can place the sen sors like temperature and humidity sensors at certain points in the city to get actual value from the fields We can also place environmental sensors at the place with very high pollution  The users of system can also add or view additional information o f the city such as public health infrastructure environment state energy supplies economic indicator etc Other information such as traffic conditions or maps of public services can also be displayed V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This study has implemen ted prototype system of smart city dashboard at Bandung It consists of network sensor server application and also communication protocol which is used for city monitoring  The summary information of city can be displayed in single view to help people wa tching, analyzing and action to what being happen to city In the future we can add more analytical tool or business intelligence to get more precise evaluation like prediction or decision system support \(DSS\ tool R EFERENCES 1 Hafedh Chourabi et al Un derstanding Smart Cities An Integrative Framework 2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 2 Washburn, D., Sindhu, U., Balaouras, S., Dines, R.
