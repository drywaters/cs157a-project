capture store and analyze this location based intervention data Using a GIS system a spatial database can be generated from the sensor intervention data which can take into account relevant geographic information in the vicinity of the sensed interventions Important geographic features that are close to the intervention locations such as plateaus hills valleys or roadways can be extracted and added to the analysis using ArcGIS GIS techniques alone cannot reveal meaningful hidden information within geographic data We have developed an integrated approach involving data mining and GIS techniques to extract 
patterns and trends in geographic data that can aid and inform analysis Our approach uses both spatial and association data mining techniques Spatial data mining is the process of discovering previously unknown interesting and potentially useful patterns from spatial datasets Applying association rule mining to the spatial data can reveal additional important spatial relationships and help determine the relevance and importance of the sensor data Spatial association rule mining was used to discover patterns in the intervention data such as linking a sensed intrusion with a potentially hidden location such as a canyon to 
infer a high probability of illegal trafìc or immigration I I NTRODUCTION Sensor networks that are used for surveillance purposes in border security generate large amounts of data The sensors are used to identify a range of potential intrusions occurring at the border This sensor data includes some meaningful information embedded within large datasets that include background noise and potentially false alarms Patterns can be identiìed within the sensor signals data that can be used to identify and reduce this noise and assist agents in identifying potentially actionable 
interventions occurring at targeted geographic locations The identiìcation of important patterns from sensor signals has been the focus of our previous study W e de v eloped Fig 1 Interventions added as a layer on AZ map along the border an off-line learning system enables us to accurately identify actionable interventions from the sensor signals Once the location and the type of interventions are known spatial data mining techniques can be applied to discover potentially useful knowledge from the data Currently there is lot of work and 
interest in Geographic data as it has become a rich source of structure and pattern making it ideal for data mining research to address problems such as sensor data analysis  The current work focuses on integrating data mining and GIS techniques to extract patterns and rules from the intervention data This paper discusses the method we have employed to extract patterns from the intervention data Geographic knowledge of the vicinity of sensor intervention data is used to create rules to extract useful patterns and information from the data Potentially important geographic features that are close 
to the intervention locations such as plateaus hills valleys or roadways can be extracted and added to the analysis using ___________________________________ 978-14244-83 51-8  1 1 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE  


ArcGIS These geographic features are extracted in the vicinity of interventions and used to inform analysis of patterns in the data II M ETHOD The objective of this work is to integrate the intervention data and the GIS data to simplify identiìcation and extraction of useful patterns Spatial association rule mining is used to extract spatial relationships between various potentially relevant features in the geographic data Interventions are simulated at various geographic locations of potential illegal activity such as illegal immigration drug or weapon trafìc categorized A B C etc The locations are described by geographic coordinates system which use units of decimal degrees for coordinates Decimal degrees are angles and these units of measure are generally used with the GIS data Xcoordinates are longitude values and Y-coordinates are latitude values For data in North America the longitude values must be negative numbers between 0 and 180 and latitude values must be positive numbers from 0 and 90 The intervention data has been added as a layer or map using a GIS system The speciìc software used for this purpose is ArcGIS Additional layers containing potentially relevant geographic features of USA that are close to the intervention locations such as plateaus hills valleys or roadways are added as separate layers Structured Query Language SQL expressions can be used to select potentially relevant features in ArcGIS Spatial join tools were used to extract the geographic features proximal to the intervention locations A table join was created to append elds from one layerês attribute table to another layerês attribute table based on the relative location of features in the two layers All the relevant features were extracted in the vicinity of the intervention test area to create a spatial database Some of the features were rivers within 5 miles highways within 5 miles elevation value at the current intervention location elevation values within a 5-mile radius etc The elevation values in the vicinity of the intervention were used to classify the current location as a hill or a valley The maximum and minimum values of the elevation within 5 miles of the intervention location were recorded The difference between the elevation value at the current location and the maximum and minimum values were used to classify the given intervention location as a plateau hill or valley Once the spatial database was generated techniques related to association rule mining  were applied to e xtract patterns in the data A spatial association rule    is used to describe the implication that one or a set of features may have on another set of features in a spatial database The data is preprocessed to format similarly to a customer market database to extract spatial association rules which is discussed in the later sections III E XPERIMENTS Sensors commonly used in surveillance applications generate vast amounts of data Border security agents use this TABLE I I NTERVENTION DATA OBTAINED FROM OFF LINE LEARNING OF SENSOR PATTERNS  Intervention ID X-Coordinate Y-Coordinate Type of Intervention 1 110.92 32.23 A 2 112.02 33.45 B 3 111.99 33.46 D 4 111.94 33.44 C 5 113.18 34.57 C 6 110.30 31.96 B Fig 2 Intervention data superimposed with geographic features on AZ map as separate layers data to identify potential interventions such as illegal immigration drug and weapon trafìc The large amount of data and high amount of noise and potentially false alarm information within this data makes human analysis extremely difìcult and problematic In our current work we simulated border security sensor data and embedded instances of speciìc information about the type of intervention and the geographic location of actionable events within the overall dataset A combination of data mining and GIS techniques were applied to gain geographic knowledge and identify important patterns from the data to attempt to separate meaningful actions from background noise to identify the targets within the overall datasets In this section we describe the data generation using GIS techniques and analysis of the geographic data to extract useful rules and patterns used in this process A Data Generation Since actual intervention data from the sensors was not available data was simulated for these experiments Approximately 200 interventions were simulated along a 15-mile strip of the AZ-Mexico border The dataset consisted of the ID of the intervention its geographic coordinates and the type of

There are many different kinds of temporal association rules i.e association rules with special regard to the temporal component one could think of for instance from events that happen sequentially c yclically 8 periodically 21 or in special times which can be described by calendar-based patterns All these rules require their o w n deìnition of support which will be given in the following C Basic Temporal Association Rules The simplest temporal association rule format to which we refer as simple or basic temporal association rule is if A occurs then B occurs within time T  written as A  T B for two strings A and B and a duration T  T can either be seen as duration in an arbitrary time unit or as in the following as symbol distance in the string representation of the discretized time series The absolute support of such an association rule can be stated as sup a  A  T B  F  A B T   where F  A B T  is deìned as     i   D  s  i   A  1 i  A  B   D  s  i  w  T  1 i  w 1      with 1  i   j  AB  1  F  A B T  is the number of occurrences of A  that are followed by B in the distance of T symbols Amongst others the parameter w is a tribute to the clustering based discretization method used in our approach confer subsection V-A Since two subsequent symbols a i and a i 1 are derived from two overlapping sliding windows a i and a i 1 are strongly correlated Thus the optional distance parameter w determines the minimal gap that should lie between the occurrences of A and B in the discretization string And nally the relative support of A  T B can be deìned as sup r  A  T B  sup a  A  T B   j  AB  1  w  Conìdence is deìned as usual i.e conf  A  T B  sup a  A  T B  sup a  A   and the J measure of A  T B is given by J  A  B T  6 detailed deìnition see above where P  B T  denotes the probability of at least one B occurring in a randomly chosen window of size T in D  s  i.e the number of windows of size T  that contain B  divided by the number of all possible windows which is j  T 1  and P  B T  A  the probability of at least on B occurring in a randomly chosen window of size T  which starts with A i.e F  A B T  divided by the absolute support of A  The format of the temporal association rule A  T B is quite simple but highly expandable as contemplated in A and B may come from one time series discretization D  s   which allows intra time serial association rule mining or A may come from time series s 1 and B from another time series s 2  which leads to pairwise inter time serial association rule mining between D  s 1  and D  s 2   The adaptation to the algorithms for calculating support and conìdence values are straight forward Note that the rule format A  T B can be seen as generalization of the standard association rule format A  B  as introduced at the beginning of this subsection if parameter T is set to null D Sequential Patterns Sequential patterns  which have been proposed in are temporal association rules derived from events that happen sequentially An obvious example from market basket analysis for such a rule might be derived from the following observation made in a video rental business People who rent the DVD The Fellowship of the Ring and then The Two Towers most likely rent the DVD with the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy namely The Return of the King thereafter too Sequential patterns as proposed in just state that if someone rents the rst and then the second movie he will most likely rent the third movie afterwards too but they do not state when this will happen Since this information is interesting too we decided to use the extension of the simple rule format A  T B for sequential pattern mining if A 1 and A 2 and  and A k occur within V units of time then B occurs within time T  written as A 1 A 2   A k  V,T B  Again A i and B may come from one or different time series discretization allowing intra and inter time serial sequential pattern mining The deìnitions of support and conìdence for all possible intra and inter time serial sequential pattern rules between one and several time series follow the basic idea behind A  T B  thus as an example here we only give the deìnition for sequential pattern rule mining for k 2  with A 1 and A 2 coming from time series s 1 and B coming from time series s 2  The absolute support of such a temporal association rule A 1 A 2  V,T B is deìned as sup a  A 1 A 2  V,T B  F  A 1 A 2 B,V,T   which states the number of occurrences of A 1 and A 2 in time series s 1 within time V  which are followed by B in s 2 in a maximal temporal distance of T from the beginning of A 1  Formally F  A 1 A 2 B,V,T  is given by     i   D  s 1  i   A 1  1 i  A 1  A 2   D  s 1  i  V  1 i   A 1   B   D  s 2  i  T  1 x   A 2       where x denotes the position of the beginning of A 2 in s 1  Note that the given deìnition forbids overlapping of A 1  A 2 and B  Furthermore we removed the parameter w  which was introduced in the deìnition of F  A B T  above in the deìnition of F  A 1 A 2 B,V,T  due to lucidity The relative support and the conìdence of A 1 A 2  V,T B are given by sup r  A 1 A 2  V,T B  sup a  A 1 A 2  V,T B   D  s 2   A 1 A 2 B  and conf  A 1 A 2  V,T B  sup a  A 1 A 2  V,T B  F  A 1 A 2 V   


and nally the J measure for the rule A 1 A 2  V,T B can be stated as J  A 1  V A 2  B T   where P  B T  denotes the probability of at least one B occurring in a randomly chosen window of size T in D  s 2   P  A 1  V A 2  the probability of association rule A 1  V A 2 occurring at a random position in D  s 1  i.e the relative support of A 1  V A 2  and P  B T  A 1  V A 2  denoting the probability of at least on B occurring in a randomly chosen window of size T in D  s 2   which starts with A 1 in D  s 1   followed by A 2 within V time units i.e F  A 1 A 2 B,V,T  divided by the absolute support of A 1  V A 2  E Cyclic and Calendar-Based Association Rules Another interesting temporal association rule format was proposed in A rule is called a cyclic association rule if it represents regular cyclic variations over time An example for this kind of association rules again from market basket analysis is the rule  beer  potato crisps   The support of this rule will probably be relatively low during the whole day and thus not discovered but in certain regular time intervals e.g every day from 7-9PM and in the corresponding database segment or part of the time series respectively it will surely have a support high enough for being discovered For a more formal deìnition and the transfer to time series analysis let us assume that time is given in a xed unit  for instance in hours and that the i th time interval i  0  is denoted by  i  which corresponds to the time interval  i    i 1     Let D  s  i denote the concatenation of the symbols of D  s   that corresponds to  i  and refer to it as time segment i  The absolute cyclic support cycSup i a  A  B  of an association rule A  B in the time segment i is given by cycSup i a  A  B      i   D  s  i  i   AB  1 i  AB      i.e the number of occurrences of A  B in the time segment i  and the relative cyclic support is deìned as cycSup i r  A  B  cycSup i a  A  B    D  s  i  AB  1  The conìdence measure for D  s  i is deìned analogously to the conìdence measures of the previous temporal association rules A cycle c is a tuple  l o   which consists of a length l and an offset o  0  o  l  both given in time units An association rule is said to have a cycle c  l o  ifit holds in every l th time unit starting with time unit  o An association rule that has a cycle is called cyclic  The beer and potato crisps rule for instance would have the two cycles c 1 24  19 and c 1 24  20  that denote every 24 hours in the 19th hour and every 24 hours in the 20th hour which is is exactly every dayês time from 7 till 9PM An association rule format which is quite similar to cyclic association rules are calendar-based association rules A calendar-based association rule is an association rule that is valid in certain time intervals which are speciìed by a former deìned calendar schema An example for such a schema might be year month day an example for a special time interval in this calendar schema might be the triple  012  11  012   where 012 denotes every arbitrary integer in the domain of the accordant attribute in this case day and year  012  11  012  represents every day in November of every year which at least in Germany is the time with the most trafìc jams As well as in the foregoing approaches support is calculated by dividing the number of occurrences of a certain association rule by the the maximal possible number of occurrences of a rule of same length Thus we omit the formal deìnitions of calendar-based support refer to and gi v e one more e xample for clariìcation instead In the calendar-based schema month day hour the beer and potato crisps rule from above would hold in the time represented by  012  012  19   012  012  20  because this denotes the 19th and 20th hour of every day in every month what refers to the time from 7 to 9PM Obviously the intersection of correlations which can be expressed by calendar-based association rules and of correlations which can be expressed by cyclic association rules is very large thus it is a matter avor how these rules are presented F Implementation The basic idea of our implementation for mining temporal association rules as mentioned in the previous subsections in time series is straight forward rst the time series have to be obtained and processed from a source In our case the data is stored in a MySQL database from which it easily can be retrieved in adequate granularities After an optional step of storing every time series derived from the database on disk or loading it from there the time series are discretized by the two methods presented in subsection V-A which results in three discretized time series representation for each time series the rst discretization is obtained by SAX the second by the clustering-based approach where the basic shapes are derived from each time series on their own and the third is derived by the clustering-based approach where the basic shapes are derived from all time series together which makes more sense for the interpretation of inter time serial association rules Afterwards the discovery of the different kinds of temporal association rules as presented in subsection V-B is started for each type independently The apriori algorithm which was presented in is the quasi-standard algorithm for efìciently mining association rules in transactional databases It bases on a lexicographical ordering of the items in each transaction but since this ordering would destroy fundamental temporal relations it cannot be applied directly for the discovery of temporal association rules in a time series database Thus for efìciently nding association rules between strings in discretized time series we can only rely on two basic concepts of this algorithm which are the monotonicity property and the candidate generation The monotonicity property applied to time series states that a string can only be frequent if every substring is frequent too Thus we do not have to search for association rules containing every possible string in the discretizations but only for strings that consist of smaller frequent strings As rst step 


Fig 3 Example of an intra time serial association rule left and an inter time serial association rules right of the form A  T B  where A is display red with rectangles and B blue with circles in discovering temporal association rules we are determining every symbol which is frequent according to the parameter minsup  The concatenations of the pairs of these symbols form the candidate set C 2  from which all frequent strings of length 2 are derived by checking if support is higher than minsup  All frequent strings of length k  1 form the set L k  1  from which again the candidate set C k is generated by adding every string of length k  which can be generated from merging two strings from L k  1  that conform in k  2 succeeding characters L k again is generated from C k by checking the minsup constraint After determining the nite set  k L k of all frequent strings the temporal association rules can simply be generated by counting their frequencies as explicated in subsection V-B We implemented our system in Java using the Eclipse IDE Several data mining algorithms in Java are freely available thus for discretizing we went the easy way and used the SAX implementation from Pavel Senin and the k-means algorithm from Weka for obtaining the clustering-based representations of the time series G Evaluation This section presents the evaluation of our system for time series analysis on two large datasets containing river level measurements and stock data The river level measurements consists of 72,000,000 tuples from 394 river stations which are obtained by the Federal Institute for Nature Environment and Consumerism of North Rhine-Westphalia Germany 1  and the stock data consists of 47,000 tuples of daily closing prices from 32 companies traded at the Nasdaq stock market from 2006-2009 obtained from the Yahoo nance server 2  All experiments have been carried out on an Intel Core 2 Duo 3.0 GHz desktop PC running Windows Vista with 3 GB of main memory We conducted several experiments with varying parameters In the rst setting we tested the runtime for dis1 http://www.lanuv.nrw.de 2 http://ìnance.yahoo.com covering intra time serial association rules versus number and size of time series As expected the runtime increased with increasing number and size of time series We conducted the same series of experiments with four different pairs of minsup and minconf values written as  minsup  minconf   namely with 2  50  10  50  10  70 and 15  70  with the result that the pair 2  50 yielded the largest number of discovered association rule followed by 10  50  10  70 and 15  70 thus the number of discovered association rules is anti proportional to minsup  Setting minsup and minconf to 2  50 and only changing T  it shows that the number of discovered association rules increases with T  Increasing w the parameter that determines the distance between the rst and the second part of the rule yields a decrease in the number of discovered association rules The runtime of the discovery of inter time serial association rules is quadratic in the number of time series because the time series are compared pairwise which was afìrmed by our experiments Figure 3 gives an example of an intra and an inter time serial occurrence of an association rule of the form A  T B  VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we presented a brief review on the analysis of time series with temporal association rule mining We gathered some previous approaches and explained in detail how to transfer four intuitive temporal association rule mining approaches simple temporal association rules as proposed in sequential patterns 7 c yclic 8 and calendar based association rules to the analysis of continuous time series In addition to that we presented a system that applies these temporal association rule mining techniques to time series analysis after discretizing the time series with SAX and two versions of the clustering-based approach from in order to reveal domain-dependent interesting coherences in one time series or between pairs of time series We evaluated our system on two large datasets containing river levels measurements and stock data which showed the functionality and the inîuence of the different parameters 


Apart from integrating further approaches for temporal association rules e.g interval-based approaches like and  after discretizing the time series to an appropriate format as explained in section IV there are some more points left for future work First of all further time series discretization methods have to be tested in the transformation process for instance deductive ones since clustering of time series was claimed to be not very meaningful apart from that we could not nd major differences in the results of our clusteringand SAX-based discretizations and especially dynamic ones since both the methods we use are rather static in the sense that one symbol has always the same duration An appropriate dynamic discretization might not only be interesting from the view point of data compression but also to make basic shapes and thus the rules more expressive Furthermore an interestingness measure for association rules which combines support conìdence and a measure that penalizes the overlapping of occurrences of an association rule could be very useful in addition to existing interestingness measures like the J measure since rules with many overlapping parts are less expressive which is not captured by the existing interestingness measures R EFERENCES  T  Schl  uter and S Conrad An approach for automatic sleep stage scoring and apnea-hypopnea detection in Proc of

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
