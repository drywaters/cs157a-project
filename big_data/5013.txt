 1  I NTRODUCTION  The Goodrich IMD HUMS and the next generation IVHMU have been equipped on a number of rotor aircraft.  The total fleet is over 40 S-92a aircraft, and close to 200 H-60 derivatives. These systems have increased operational readiness by improving the quality of information needed to perform maintenance.  Additionally, by improving usage 1  1  1-4244-1488-1/08/$25 00 ©2008 IEEE  2 IEEEAC paper #1173, Versi on 1, Updated Oct 22, 2007 calculation and automating th e yellow sheet process 
maintenance cost per flight   The mechanical diagnostics \(M D beneficial: it has a proven capability to identifying anomalous components, which upon inspection required maintenance.  However, the full power of the system, the ability to reduce unscheduled maintenance, has not been realized.  Certainly, some opportunistic maintenance has been performed based on high health indicators \(HI\or ob HIs that show a consistent upward trend, but the ability to plan maintenance activities fift y or one hundred hours in the future remains elusive The current trending/diagnos tics capability has not fully negated the need for unscheduled maintenance.  Nor does 
the current capability significantly reduce the logistic footprint by allowing maintenance to be planed tens even hundreds of hours in the future Such a capability would have far reaching consequences in terms of the management of a fleet and greatly reduce the chance of unscheduled maintenance occurring The ability to predic t the RUL tens or hundreds of hours in the future requires three technical issues to be resolved 1  Vibration based prognostics/diagnostics measure a signature on which an algorithm operates.  The output of the algorithm is a condition indicator which is a descriptive statistic of the component health.  In some cases, the measure is a direct metric, such as shaft order 1, 2 or 3 vibration in 
inches per second \(IPS\ other time, the metric has no physical meaning, such as residual kurtosis for a gear.  In all cases, the CIs are noisy, due to the interaction of component stiffness, torque airspeed, aircraft attitude, etc.  This noise makes even simple trending difficult 2  The relationship between a vibration based CI and damage is not well established.  Even in relatively direct measured means such as shaft order 2 or 3 which are indicative a cracked coupling or bent shaft, it is not clear what level of damage is present on the shaft when these i ndicators are elevated 


 2 For bearings or gears, the CI relationship to damage is more tenuous.  From service history and test stand, one finds that elevated CI are indicative of damage, but how much damage, and how much RUL is unclear 3  It is not clear, once a component is in a fault propagation mode, how to best model the RUL.  It is unlikely that the relationship is linear Additionally, in most cases the components material properties are not entirely know.  This makes detailed, physics based models impracticable.  Even if all of the inputs to the model were know, it would be difficult compute RUL for every component on the limited computational resources available on the aircraft or a ground station Presumably, if these technical hurdles can be surmounted, it should be possible to estimate a RUL with some small bound on error.   It is felt that the most difficult of these problems to resolve is \(2\ small shift in paradigm, it becomes feasible 2  L OGISTICS VS   C RITICAL S AFETY I TEM  Problem \(2\requires approaching the issue of maintenance from a logistics perspective instead of a critical safety item CSI\or safety of flight \(SOF\ssue. Using non-destructive inspection \(e.g. HUMS data\fo r inspection of CSI requires a higher standard of information.  It is implied that failure of a CSI could result in lose of aircraft and crew.  Thus gaining maintenance credit \(using HUMS instead of inspection\requires an explicit relationship of damage to CI/HI Alternatively, if HUMS CI/HI information is used for logistics, there is no change concerning airworthiness directives.  Using HUMS to supplement existing inspection and to schedule maintenance on components that are thought to requirement maintenance can greatly reduce unscheduled maintenance events.  Changing to this logistics paradigm relaxes the requirement for an explicit relationship between damage and CI/HI value A number of studies have shown that there exits a relationship between physical damage and measured vibration signatures.  Goodrich, under funding of the Center for Rotorcraft Innovati  3 has shown t h at  t h ere i s  an 87% correlation between measured vibration \(1 CI\to physical damage length, and over 95% correlation between an HI \(weighted sum of CIs\th physical damage.  This is important for two reasons.  It suggests that crack length a  physical damage\and that the HI can model crack length with a simple linear model 2 2 1 0 a B a HI       1 Secondly, the exact relationship between HI/CI and damage is unimportant.  As noted, in using HUMS for logistic support requires no explicit re lationship between damage and HI level. Logistics only requires that when maintenance is recommended, the component is degraded enough for maintenance to be appropriate.  This allows a maintenance policy to govern when repairs are conducted.  For example a policy is set that maintenance is performance when the HI exceeds some value, say 0.9.  Th e maintainer is assured that when a component is at an HI greater than 0.9, it has damage, and that it is appropriate for maintenance to be performance \(e.g. low probability of a component at 0.9 not requiring maintenance\ Given more service history, the scaling of the HI can be ma de such that the explicit relationship between crack/physical damage and HI is know eq. 1\ at this time, it is only important to know that the relationship exits In allowing the HI to only assure that the component is damaged, the problem reverts to one of identifying components which are thought to be anomalous. A number of algorithms have been proposed and tested for anomaly detection   5   6   and [7  For t h i s paper, t h e HI i s  based on a statistical approach of multi-dimensional hypothesis testing using the Nakagami probability distribution  For shaft and beari ng C I t h e general form  of the HI calculation is  v HI T 7  0  1 CI CI    2 where CI  is a vector of CI values  is the covariance of the CI Values and v  is the critical value for a Nakagami with n  degrees of freedom.

These cracks will penetrated into the body of the material and continue to grow.  The growth behavior of the crack has been the subject of numerous experiment studies. These studies have attempted to derive a theoretical relationship between rate of crack growth and the number of stress cycles Since 1953, a number of crack growth theories have been presented 1  Head’s Theory 2  The Geometrical Similarity hypothesis

For components encountered in a transmission they are unknown.  As such, some simplifying assumptions can be made to simplify analysis. For many components/material, the crack growth exponent is 2, which will be used as a default value.   The geometric correction factor  is set to 1.  The equation \(4\uces to da dN  D 4  2  a   5 The goal is to determine the number of cycles N remaining until a crack length a is reached.  Taking the reciprocal of 5 dN da  1 D 4  2  a    6 Integrating gives the number of cycles N aining.  Note that N for synchronous systems \(e.g. constant RPM\ is equivalent to time by multiplying with a constant  N  dN da a o a f  1 D 4  2  a  da   1 D 4  2   ln a f   ln a o    7  This gives the number of cycles N from the current measured crack a o to the final crack length a f As noted previously, the measured co mponent health \(HI used as a surrogate for crack length a in keeping with the logistics paradigm.  The only remaining unknown is D a material constant of the crack growth equation 4  F ILTERING   E STIMATION OF DA  D N AND D It was stated that vibration based CI/HI are noisy. From equation \(5\ident that in addition to a filtered/denoised HI, the rate of change of the HI is needed to estimate D One method for filter and state reconstruction \(e.g reconstructing an unknown parameter from observed data is the Kalman filter [10  The Kalman filter is a kinematic model in which a filter gain is set optimally based on the measurement and system variance.

For this case, where the states are health, and the rate of change of health dHI/dt\ integrator Two Kalman filters are run: one to filter the measured HI and calculated dHI/dt \(rate of crack growth\o estimate the unknown parameter D The unknown D can be found via an extended Kalman f ilter, where an estimate of

Additionally since the Kalman filter is an iterative estimate of D, it requires some small number of updates to converge  Figure 3 Estimate of D, Material Constant The number of cycles remaining converges to the experiment results quickly.  It is noted that the number of cycles remaining is a function of D and da/dN Note that the estimated RUL converges to the observed remaining life quickly, and is remarkable accura te predictor of the cycles remaining 


 5  Figure 4 Cycles Remaining Given this validation, the same procedure was tested against real work data acquired from a utility helicopter 5  R EAL W ORLD E XAMPLES  Two real world examples are presented, the first being a shaft example, the second being a bearing example. The shaft example case is a high-speed input shaft. It present challenges in that the cyclic loading is not constant.  It is assumed that load is a function of mission/regime flown The second example is a generator drive ball bearing While the load is relatively constant, it was found that it required a different crack growth exponent. Both examples show encouraging results High Speed Input Shaft The high-speed input shaft rotates at approximately 22,000 RPM and delivers a maximum of 700+ horse power and 300 ftlbs of torque to the main module.  While shaft failures are exceeding rare, at times shaft balances are required for maintenance.  Additionally, there is a limited chance that the shaft coupling could crack or become loose In the validation example, known crack values and strain where used.  In the shaft exampl e, there is no direct measure of physical damage.  Instead, as previously noted in addressing problem \(2\the shaft health \(HI surrogate for damage. The metric for RUL was hours until the HI was greater than 0.9 as per the maintenance policy The HI was derived from \(2\CI’s where magnitude of vibration for shaft orders 1, 2 and 3. Note that for a constant RPM system, the only difference between cycles N d time is a scalar multiplier The power transmitted to the main module is dependent on how the aircraft is flown.  Ostensible, there is a relationship between engine torque and cyclic strain – again, it is unclear what that relationship is.  For that reason, four measures of torque were used to estim ate cyclic loading between acquisitions.  It is hypothesized that between two acquisitions, any change in component health is a function of torque: a flight regime requiring high torque are more damaging than benign regimes The shaft example encompasses approximately 371 hour of usage, over 304 operations \(an operation in IMD-HUMS generates a raw data file\ the end of which maintenance was conducted.  The time was calculated by measuring the cumulative time between acquis itions where torque was 10%.  Approximately 60% of the time the aircraft a torque less than 30%, suggesting a ground turn. Raw and filter data are presented in figure 5  Figure 5 Raw and Filtered Input Shaft The Kalman filter “filter factor” and ability to reconstruct and observables is based on c onfiguration input variables for the plant noise and the m easurement noise. The Kalman filter parameters for plant noise was set at 0.01 \(e.g maximum rate of change of health is .01/hour\while the measurement noise was 0.2 \(standard deviation of the HI The median % torque between acquisitions was found to have the highest correlation with the rate of change in health.  This was then used fo r strain metric at each update to N Note that at approximately time 150, torque and rate of change correlate reasonable well \(figure 6\ In figure 5 it appears that at time 150, the shaft starts to propagate the fault, which supports supported by figure 6 


 6  Figure 6 dH/dt and Median % Torque vs. Time Some assumptions were made with the Kalman filter model for both filtering the shaft health and for estimation of the material constant D.  First, it is assumed a priori that components do not “heal” themselves \(that is, dH/dt is zero or positive\ Thus, in the filtering operations, if dH/dt was negative, it was set to zero.  Second, from equation \(7\t is apparent that D must be greater than zero.  A test for this condition was made as well, with D being set to 1e-7 if negative or zero \(figure 7  Figure 7 D \(Material Constrant Note that dD/dN is effectiv ely zero until time 230.  This corresponds well with when the prognostic for RUL tracks well with the actual RUL \(figure 8  Figure 8 RUL and Prognostics Hours Remaining  At approximately 220 hours, the predicted RUL prognostic is within a few percent of the actual hours remaining until maintenance \(e.g. HI > 0.9\s suggests a prognostic of 150 operational hours Generator Shaft Drive Ball Bearing The generator shaft drive ba ll bearing showed elevated HI/CI was removed for operation.

The trend of shaft order 1, 2 and 3 are similar to the trend observed in figure 9.  This suggests that the failure model is not a function of component type \(bearing vs. shaft\, but location.  Figure 10 displays the RUL and the predicted RUL using this model.  It is likely that the accuracy is limited to the reso lution of measuring cyclic strain.  Currently, there is no parametric data to measure current load on the generator  Figure 10 RUL and Prognostics Hours Remaining for Bearing 6  D ISCUSSION  In the short term, it is unlikely that any HUMS algorithm will be able to quantify physical damage based on a vibration based sensor.  This in of itself will limit the ability for maintenance credits to be applied to HUMS equipped aircraft.  However, this does not limited the reduction in aircraft operating cost that could be achieve by using MD information into reduce unscheduled maintenance and reduce the logistics foot print required to operate a fleet of aircraft.  As demonstrated, techniques for prognostics could be available for operators use Prognostics techniques based on probabilistic m   such as Hi dden Sem i M arkov M odel s based repai r  activity on the cumulative proba bilities that the component will last n units of time.  This is a difficult concept to articulate and hard to make maintenance decisions on.  The technique presented here could simplify the decision process of maintainers by giving a rough estimate of the time remaining until a maintenance action is taken.  This is a policy decision and does not impact safety of flight Certainly this methodology requires additional work Additional area of work could be 1  For a class of components, is the material constant D the same between components 2  Does the application of a geometric correction factor improve performance 3  Are there better measures of cyclic strain that torque 4  The Kalman filter is used for filtering, are other methodologies, such as particle filter, more appropriate

Hopefully, this Paris Law model will provide useful indication of the RUL and eventually be incorporated into a maintenance support tool  R EFERENCES    Som e rs, T.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.  The ITRS is predicting that by the year 20 25, CRAM-based devices will have a capacity of 128 Mbit per die; NROM will have 32 Gb per die. Flash will be available at 512 Gb per die [9 Table  5 highlights the number of die necessary of three discussed technologies to achi eve a recorder of specified capacity in the timeframe given Table 5 - Minimum Device Count by Technology to achieve a Data Recorder of Specified Capacity in the Year shown.  \(Example, a 30 Tb recorder being designed in the year 2020 would require 468,750 CRAM devices or 1,875 NROM devices, or 118 Flash devices  Therefore, a 130 Tb data recorder designed using devices predicted available in the year 2030, would require the following number of devices \226 not including any additional devices used for Error Detection and Correction \(EDAC\ or sparing and word control 200  CRAM: > 1 million devices Year Recorder Capacity CRAM 4Mb NROM 1Gb Flash 16Gb 720,000 2,880 180 64Mb 16Gb 256Gb 468,750 1,875 118 128Mb 32Gb 512Gb 1.02E+06 4,063 254 Required Not Reqiured Required EDAC Technology / Device Capacity /Chip Count 2010 2020 2030 2.88 Tb 30 Tb 130 Tb 


 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.  It is important to note that this may not be the prime candidate, but was chosen for known characteristics Selection of a more appropri ate EDAC code [2 w oul d  most assuredly, bring about a reduction in recorder mass and power One final, important, distinction between the two prime technologies is required The NROM devices analyzed for this paper have built-in an incredibly powerful error detection and correction machine, capable of detecting four bits in error in a single word, and correcting three bits per word [10  W i t h th is m e th od t h e Bit Error Rate is calculated by the manufacturer to be less than 1.18E 19  errors/bit-day \226 equivalent to 3 unrecoverable bit errors every 550 years for the entire recorder; therefore, the package numbers presented here do not include extra devices required for EDAC other than that provided by the chip itself Table 6 - HC-SSR Basic Features 200  Redundant SpaceWire interfaces 200  Redundant Power Converters 200  Redundant Controllers/Supervisors 200  Multi-plane Non-volatile storage 200  Error detection and correction 200  Device isolation to the EDAC Word  Figure 18 - HC-SSR Conceptual Block Diagram

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.  In the figure, nearly two hundred 2-Gbit NROM devices are installed on each face of the 9U card.  \(The whitespace is preserved in this example for passive components and design margin.\e time of this writing, the availability of chip-stacked NROM devices was uncertain and omitted from the trade space Design of a Flash-based memory card would be of similar ilk.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
