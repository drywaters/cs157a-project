 However because of the variability associated with physiological measurements such as the heart rate blood pressure or body temperature of an individual it is often necessary to repeat the tests or measurements in order to arrive at a reliable diagnosis If the measurements are 002 tuples of feature values and model the problem of predicting the class label for each patient as a multiple instance learning problem 3 However because the different tests or measurements have different sources of variability associated with them it is not uncommon to carry out the tests in an asynchronous fashion with each test repeated different number of times Hence as illustrated in Table I it is far more meaningful to model the input to the classiìer in this case an individual

Figure 2 Generation process for the synthetic data We control and to generate data with bags of size  Dirichlet parameter and is deterministically generated given and  We deìned three groups of balanced data sets where generations of data sets in a group only differ in for example for the positive class the bags are likely to contain approximately equal numbers of 0ês and 1ês whereas for the negative class the bags are likely to contain either a majority of 0ês or a majority of 1ês hence this ensures that the expected multinomial parameters for both classes are  Interestingly the behaviors of Mode+NB and CCVD+LR vary across three groups of experiments In the case of Mode+NB it fails in Group 2 because it is most likely that one of two values of the second bag if an instance contains three values with 40 counts In other words consists of only one value and consists of even number of two values

and each instance is represented by a tuple of feature values Only the label of the bag is speciìed in the training set and MIL assumes that a bag is labeled negative if and only if all of its instances are negative and a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one of its instances is positive Since then recent work on MIL has relaxed the standard MIL assumption to allow all the instances in a bag to contribute to the bagês label However unlike MIL which models an object to be classiìed by a  DIL models an object to be classiìed as a  Both MIL and DIL reduce to the same problem when the number of features   is one DIL bears some resemblance to Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA or more generally probabilistic topic models which are generati v e probabilistic models for documents that model each word in a document by a mixture of latent topics i.e distributions over a xed vocabulary While the topic models are typically learned in an unsupervised setting a documentês topic distribution can be effectively used for document classiìcation as demonstrated in Supervised topic models such as sLD A proposed by can be seen as a special case of DIL where the number of bags   in the DI representation of the objects to be classiìed in this case documents is equal to one However recent work on topic models e.g Block-LDA Nubbi 20 and Link-PLSA-LD A 21 has begun to explore topic models for objects with multiple features   Block-LDA models documents where each document contains collections of entities of different types which can be modeled by different bags that make up a distributional instance in DIL DIL can be seen as a supervised variant of such topic models i.e supervised topic models deìned over multiple features   with discrete domain DIL can be used to model learning from relational data and RDF data 23 F or e xample relational Bayesian classiìers 25 model an object nodes in a network to be classiìed using bags of values of features from those objects that are related to it via relational links We have explored only some of the simplest approaches to DIL It would be interesting to explore DIL models that account for dependencies between feature values within a bag as well as between bags It would be useful to consider variants of kernel methods e.g SVM that use kernel functions to compute similarity between distributional instances e.g adaptations of kernel functions for distributions  to the setting with  Of particular interest in this context are support measure machines SMM introduced by which e xtend SVMs by representing distrib utions as mean embeddings in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space which allows the application of standard kernel methods for classifying probability distributions One subtle difference between the DIL formulation in this paper and that of SMMs is that the input to an SMM classiìer is a probability distribution whereas the input to a distributional classiìer is a tuple of bags where each bag is a nite sample drawn from a feature and object speciìc albeit unknown distribution It would be interesting to consider DIL variants of decision trees random forests support vector machines nearest neighbor classiìers etc as well as variants of DIL models and algorithms that can handle ordinal or continuous valued features Of particular interest are DIL algorithms that can effectively handle massive data sets with billions or trillions of objects and millions or billions of attributes each represented using bags ranging in size from tens of thousands to millions of values A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported in part by a grant IIS 0711356 from the National Science Foundation NSF and in part by the Iowa State University Center for Computational
