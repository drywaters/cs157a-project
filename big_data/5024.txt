1 Introduction 
turing and technology sectors Man y of the methodological bases for innovation that have been developed for physical goods technologies and software systems do not easily port to services Service inno v ation is a particularly hard problem There are multiple ways in which one might decompose the service innovation problem den Hertog concludes that service innovation can be considered in four dimensions 1 service concept 2 client interface 3 service delivery system and 4 technology Alternati v ely  we might conceptualize service innovation in terms of process inno 
vation enterprise structure innovation service interface innovation and contractual/business model innovation In a similar vein Miles argues that all of these forms of innovation require reorganization of the processes and procedures underpinning services Innovation therefore involves identifying new ways of doing things know-how or process innovation new ways of organizing the enterprise new service interfaces and novel business models or contractual arrangements These innovations can be of two kinds those that have been de 
ployed elsewhere but not in the context of the enterprise in question and those that have never before been identiìed or deployed This paper offers means of leveraging both categories of innovation We will argue that the former category of innovation can be 
 both from open-source data such as the web or from data collected via bespoke instrumentation We shall refer to these as  The second category of innovation which have not been iden 
harvested harvested innovations 
tiìed before and/or never deployed shall be referred to as 
 We shall argue that harvesting innovations from open data sources is often feasible and shall illustrate this by describing a simple system that harvests know-how from the textual content of the web We shall then illustrate the use of data collected using bespoke instrumentation in mining process semantics and in mining intent the techniques for these are closely related The data being leveraged in all of these applications is 
discovered innovations 
big data In the rst instance the data store being mined is the textual content of the web In the second instance the data sources are object state sensors In mining intent we use large repositories of behaviour logs as the data source The nal step in this account is the use of systematic search in 
innovation which helps overcome some of the innate limitations of big data analytics in supporting innovation

Data to support service innovation can be found almost everywhere Service innovation requires identifying novel enterprise architectures Legacy artefacts can be mined for components of an enterprise architecture Bespoke instrumentation can be leveraged for mining the formal semantics for key components of an enterprise architecture It is possible to mine organizational intent from behaviour histories Innovation requires departure from past precedent Discovered innovation must be underpinned by search 
Our approach to service innovation is underpinned by the following 7 principles/observations Many of the data sources that we will discuss below will be situated within enterprise boundaries and might not be available for use outside of the enterprise Many other data sources however are increasingly becoming open such as open government data Still other data sources such as the content of the web are intrinsically open Finally we now have the wherewithal to instrument data collection infrastructures that can generate vast quantities of open data e.g government-mandated logs of B2B and B2C interactions to be maintained by all government contractors Consider the following examples There is a long history of the use of process support systems in enterprise contexts We therefore have a large and growing repository of process logs to draw upon for innovation insights Organizations often driven by compliance considerations routinely maintain logs of internal messaging emails memos or even simpler semaphores as well as external B2B or B2C interactions A range of objects are involved in the delivery of services A range of objects are also impacted by services The objects in question might be physical objects or business objects such as an insurance claim a credit application etc It is possible to instrument state monitors to log state changes of both types of objects Legacy artefacts such as UML models textual artefacts etc can also be a rich source of innovation insights The textual content of the web can serve as an important source of insights In the remainder of the paper we will offer examples of the use of each of these types of data sources in harvesting innovation Enterprise architectures offer answers to the questions of who what and when and offer an integrated view of the enterprise from multiple perspectives including process models role models goals models etc Service innovation must be underpinned by novel conceptualizations of these such as novel process models novel sets of strategic objectives and so on One might then tentatively conîate service innovation with innovative conceptualizations of the enterprise as seen through the lenses of these models Novel enterprise architecture components can be mined from legacy artefacts such as the textual content of the web or legacy models A novel organization of roles within an enterprise might be extracted from text on the web or from a legacy UML sequence diagram A novel process design can similarly be extracted from web-based text or a legacy collection of UML state diagrams The need for formal semantics for the components of an enterprise architecture is well recognized For instance formal semantics enable consistency and completeness analysis of goals Formal semantics annotation of process models enables sophisticated compliance management Formal annotation of behavioural models in general permits goal realization analysis It is possible to obtain formal semantic annotations by instrumenting state monitors for objects impacted by a service or involved in the delivery of a service An important element of service innovation is understanding enterprise intent the goals/objectives that services must be designed to satisfy Enterprise intent is often not articulated or carefully documented It is possible to mine a history of prior behaviour to obtain a reasonably accurate representation of the intent that is manifested in such behaviour This can involve both harvested innovation and discovered innovation Harvested innovation can be obtained by looking for clues for service design and the supporting enterprise architecture design outside enterprise boundaries This permits the enterprise to innovate by departing from past enterprise precedent More generally the need to depart from past precedent also forms the basis for an important observation about the limits of big data analytics as a basis for innovation Big data analytics offers a means for learning from and thence perpetuating past precedent Innovation on the other hand requires us to explore designs that have never before been considered The limitations of big data analytics in service innovation can be surmounted via the application of systematic search through the space of potential designs of services and service delivery environments We outline how this might be achieved in the context of innovation in business process design later in this paper

A key component of service design is knowledge about the means to achieve desired ends The representation of know-how can take many forms Goal models offer rich encodings of know-how A goal model describes how high-level goals might be reìned/decomposed to sub-goals which are in turn further decomposed into subgoals with the lowest level of reìnement relating sub-goals to artefacts describing behaviour/functionality such as requirements designs procedures and so on Goal models describe know-how in a or fashion i.e they describe how goals might be realized via sub-goals without specifying the sequencing or coordination via more complex control structures of these subgoals Other schemes for specifying know-how such as procedures or process models relate goals with sub-goals whose achievement is procedurally speciìed Legacy artefacts represent a rich but often-ignored source of know-how We classify such artefacts henceforth called  into two categories and  Text artefacts are documents such as memos manuals requirements documents design documents mission/vision statements meeting minutes etc Model artefacts could be models in a variety of notations including UML design models or enterprise models or rule models Source artefacts for know-how might be found in enterprise repositories or outside enterprise boundaries the latter are particularly important as sources of innovative insights In our earlier work on the framework we built a tool-kit that sought to improve the productivity of business analysts engaged in the exercise of business process modeling by shifting the focus in modeling from model-building to model-editing Our aim was to address the  a version of the wellknown   from a different perspective also represents a know-how harvesting tool deìned two categories of model extraction techniques text-to-model extraction for extracting process models from text artefacts and model-to-model extraction for extracting process models from models in other notations Our guiding premise was that most organizations maintain enterprise repositories of sometimes legacy documents and models which can provide rich sources of information that could be mined to extract rst-cut process models Our premise was also that by extracting such rst-cut models henceforth referred to as  and presenting them to an analyst for editing such a toolkit could signiìcantly enhance analyst productivity Given that organizations are often loathe to invest the resources required for signiìcant modeling exercises the availability of such a toolkit could make modeling-in-the-large a viable option in many instances In addition to deìning novel text-to-model and modelto-model extraction techniques the framework had to address a range of other challenges The tool was able to extract a large number of sometimes small process protomodels from an enterprise repository Some of these protomodels were in fact alternative descriptions of the same process We developed heuristic techniques for establishing to deal with such situations When multiple models that seem to describe the same process are identiìed we need to cross-validate these against each other We used as a basis for cross-validation i.e alternative consistent descriptions of the same process are viewed as supporting each other The toolkit turned out to be effective in achieving its original goals Our empirical evaluation suggested that using the tool could reduce modeling effort by as much as two-thirds can thus form the basis for discovering knowhow in the form of proto-process models from repositories of text and model artefacts It is possible to conceive of public good repositories of such artefacts being created to support innovation harvesting of this form Our recent work has explored the efìcacy of text-to-model extraction techniques in the context of what might be viewed as the largest public good repository of all the world-wide web We instrumented web crawlers together with a natural language processing NLP toolkit NLTk to tra wl the web for commonly used natural language patterns for describing know-how The tool design consists of two key components This is a high-throughput engine for extracting from the textual content of the web In a recent experiment a single crawler was able to produce 22 useful know-how descriptors in the space of about 30 minutes from 446 webpages The extractor was instrumented to extract instances of a single textual pattern the steps to be separated by an AND or an OR The following are two examples of the descriptors extracted

The rst descriptor is an example of a fairly general statement of know-how while the second is an example of a descriptor that is quite context-speciìc While the former is readily usable even the latter can be leveraged for value if there is some modicum of human input e.g ontological markup that identiìes the Village Pump as a community newsletter It is clear that machinery such as this can generate very large volumes of know-how descriptors Leveraging value from such a repository requires the use of lters that retrieves from the repository those descriptors that are relevant for a speciìc goal or context A detailed description of the design of such lters is outside the scope of this paper The key conclusion to be drawn from the preceding discussion is that machinery to mine relevant know-how from textual source on the web as well as from repositories of legacy textual and model artefacts is feasible In this section we will outline one approach to extracting semantic annotations for business process designs by using a network of object state sensors/monitors coupled with execution histories e.g process logs We will illustrate the machinery for mining process semantics by using the ProcessSEER framework which permits us to determine at design time the answer to the following question that can be posed for any point in the process design what would the effects of the process be if it were to execute up to this point The answer is offered in the form of a set of assertions in the underlying formal language typically rst-order logic but more expressive languages such as CTL could be used in its place The answer is necessarily non-deterministic since a process might have taken one of many possible alternative paths through a process design to get to that point The nondeterminism also arises from the fact that the effects of certain process steps might undo the effects of prior steps the inconsistencies that result in the snapshot of the domain that we seek to maintain might be resolved in multiple alternative ways a large body of work in the reasoning about action community addresses this problem The answer to the question is therefore provided via a set of effect scenarios any one of which might eventuate in a process instance The ProcessSEER approach simpliìes the task of semantic effect annotation by only requiring that tasks populating a capability library be annotated with context-independent immediate effects The ProcessSEER tool then contextualizes these effects by propagating them through a process model speciìed in BPMN in the current instance to determine the cumulative effect scenarios at the end of each task ProcessSEER uses formal machinery theorem-provers to compute cumulative effects but provides an analyst-friendly Controlled Natural Language CNL interface coupled with a domain ontology that permits the immediate effects of tasks to be speciìed in natural language but with a restricted set of sentence formats The use of CNL permits us to translate these natural language speciìcations into underlying formal representation which in turn makes the use of theorem-provers possible ProcessSEER also makes provision for local task-speciìc non-functional annotations to be propagated through a process design so that we are able to determine the cumulative non-functional scenarios for each task in a process design as well This approach to semantic effect annotation of process models has turned out to be effective in supporting business process compliance analysis the ef fect scenarios specify all possible outcomes of the execution of a business process goal markup of business processes consistenc y analysis of inter-operating business processes and the design of enterprise process architectures The acquisition of immediate effect annotation of tasks in the capability library remains an open problem While specifying effects in a context-independent fashion for tasks in the capability library is signiìcantly simpler than specifying the effects of every task in every process design of interest analysts are typically reluctant to engage in any kind of semantic effect annotation exercise indeed the organizational and human impediments to the more basic exercise of process modeling are well-recognized Our recent work addresses this problem by developing an automated machinery for generating a set of rst-cut effect annotations which can be subsequently reìned/edited by analysts Our approach relies on identifying the set of objects both physical and business objects impacted by a business process and instrumenting a set of state sensors/monitors for each of these such that it is possible to identify the state of each object in terms of a pre-determined vocabulary of state variables at any point in time One might conceive of an in a manner akin to a process log consisting of a series of time-stamped entries with each entry describing the state of every object of interest and with an entry for every state change in any object of interest Placing a process log and an effect log in temporal justiìcation provides a rough indication of which state changes might have triggered by the execution of a given task A simple solution is to identify state changes in terms of changes of values assigned to state variables as the effects of the execution of temporally co-occurring tasks This solution works under two critical assumptions First we must assume that

only one process is executed at any point in time so that any state changes manifested can be causally traced back to the execution of that process and no other Second we must assume that every state change is a direct effect of a process task and not a or indirect effect Both assumptions are somewhat restrictive In general multiple processes might be co-incident on a given set of objects and many of the state changes sensed might be the indirect effects of process tasks A more sophisticated solution involves setting up an abductive reasoning problem with the immediate effects of process tasks serving as the set of abducibles and the set of relevant domain constraints and causal rules forming the knowledge base A range of heuristics can be brought to bear on the problem of deciding which of the multiple possible abductive explanations for a set of co-occurring state changes represent the best description of the effects of a given task A detailed description of this machinery is outside the scope of this paper but an important conclusion from this account is that a large-scale instrumentation of object state sensors can be leveraged for obtaining formal semantic annotations of behavioural models An important question in the context of service innovation and the related problem of documenting enterprise architectures is identifying  i.e the business or strategic objectives of the enterprise Organizations often neglect to carefully document their goals and strategies and what little is documented is often in the form of a very high-level strategy document deìned at the boardlevel It is also not uncommon to nd situations where the externally manifested behaviour of the enterprise deviates from its declared high-level strategies Our recent work on strategy mining leverages a Business Objective Modeling Language BOML which of fers the following modeling constructs A  Goals are descriptions of conditions that an organization seeks to achieve Goals admit boolean evaluation i.e an organization is able to clearly determine whether it has achieved a goal or not consider the following example  This notion of a goal closely corresponds to that used in goal-oriented requirements engineering An  An objective function is a construct used in operations research techniques to deìne what the or solution to an optimization problem might be These are typically articulated as or  where is a function deìned on the using which the constraints that are required to satisfy are also written Our analysis of a large number of actual corporate strategy documents as well as the management literature suggests that strategies involving or are articulated in the form of maximization or minimization objectives Consider the following statements of strategy  In the rst of these the intent is to minimize a function encoding order lead time while in the second a function encoding some deìnition of customer satisfaction for instance using average customer wait times at the customer contact centre the number of escalations the number of product returns etc is maximized A  A plan is a set of goals together with a set of sequencing and related coordination constraints In the most general sense a plan can be as complex as a process model In this paper we will view plans only as linear sequences of goals This is because SML is designed to be used by senior management i.e individuals within an organization who might be involved in strategy formulation Also our analysis of a large number of actual corporate strategy documents suggests that strategies are typically articulated at a very high level of abstraction where control structures more complex than linear sequencing is never required A typical example is the following anonymized but actual strategy statement  There are three steps goals in this strategy connected via a linear sequencing relation The ServAlign framework and tool supports the automated analysis of alignment of service or capability designs with strategy models represented in BOML Service designs are speciìed in terms of service post-conditions in the same underlying formal language that one might use in the context of semantic effect annotation of process models and QoS guarantees typically in the form of linear inequalities involving QoS measures The alignment machinery involves a novel combination of goal satisfaction analysis plan conformance analysis and optimization with respect to the objective functions deìned in the BOML strategy model Our approach to strategy mining effectively inverts this machinery We assume the existence of a representing the strategic behaviour of the enterprise A behaviour log is a process log extended with  one for each critical enterprise decision Each decision entry documents the available choices and the selected option

 Even using a 2Gbps optical fiber, five parallel encryptions suffice to the requirement of max speed of 250MB/s. The max speeds are also illustrated in Fig. 13 as dot lines Since the speed bound line ascends linearly, it  s easy to determine, as the method above, how many parallels should be deployed to achieve the maximum transmitting speed of bandwidth  Figure 13  Speed bounds comparing to max transmitting speed b  Analysis of Key Generation Since key generation occurs only once for a new torrent file, it  s easy to determine that generating ten thousand keys consumes only 11 seconds \(multiply 0.11 milliseconds to 10,000\.

Other languages may be used in realistic deployment to achieve better performance 3\ Restricted by facilities an d environments in lab, all experiments and evaluations are completed within the local area network, instead of wider one such as Internet This fact may result in inaccuracy of experimental results but according to the analyses in Part IV, the functionality won  t be affected and the efficiency will still be acceptable in future implementation A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This paper is supported by the Hi-tech Research and Development Program of China \(863 Program\ under Grant No. 2011AA01A205, the Open Research Fund of The Academy of Satellite Application under grant NO SSTC-YJS-01-03, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61232009, the Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China under Grant No. 20101102110018,Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant No. 4122042, the fund of the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment under Grant No. SKLSDE-2012ZX-06 R EFERENCES  1  The Coming Data Deluge, IEEE Spectrum, February 2011 2  The data deluge, www.economist.com/node/15579717, Feb 25 2010 3  Arun Chokkalingam, Firasath Riyaz.
