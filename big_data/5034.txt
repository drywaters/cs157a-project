 Optimization Algorithm of Association Rule Mining Based on Reducing the Time of Generating Candidate Itemset Huang Qiu-yong, Tang Ai-long dept. of mathematical  and computer science Liuzhou Teachers College Liuzhou,  China e-mail: tal2208@126.com Sun Zi-guang dept.  of computer engineering Guangxi University of Technology Liuzhou, China   Abstract 227There are some problems about some optimization algorithms of Apriori such as they consume large memory space although they reduce the numbers of database scanning, or the problem about the difficulties to realize programming. This paper presents an Apriori\222s optimization 
algorithm. The algorithm first uses the order character of itemsets to reduce the times of comparison and connection when it connects and generates the candidate itemsets, then compresses the candidate itemsets according to the following situation: whether the number of element "a" in the frequent K-itemsets is less than K. Through the experiment it is proved that the algorithm can not only realize programming easily but also improve the efficiency of mining association rules Keywords-Data mining; Association rule; Apriori algorithm;  Candidate itemset; Frequent itemset  I   I NTRODUCTION  Association rule is an important branch of data mining 
research. It can find the relationship of project and its attribute or can find the relationship of attribute and attribute. For association rules mining, the most classical algorithm is Apriori algorithm. Firstly, it finds frequent itemsets, and then produces association rules by the frequent itemsets. In order to avoid the disadvantages of Apriori algorithm needing repeatedly scanning database and producing a large number of frequent itemsets scholars put forward the improvement methods of Apriori algorithm. Through research and analysis, most improvement of the Apriori algorithm is remaining some problems. One is that it solved the problem of the multiple scanning of the transaction database, yet it takes more time 
in some other aspects. Another is that some algorithms are simple in methodology, but it is difficult to implement by programming or even impossible to achieve. The literature 1 p r op os ed an i m pr ov e d  al g o ri t h m of as s o ci a t i o n ru l e s  based on the tree data structure. Each node of the tree is formed by the item and item\222s transaction list, sibling is ordered in accordance with the support count of subset increasing order from left to right, each node with a pointer to TID list of transaction which itemsets corresponding to node contain. Finally, the algorithm mergers transactions which have same TID to find the frequent itemsets Although the algorithm scans the database only once, but it takes a lot of time to compare one by one to find the item 
with same TID. The literature [2 p r o p o s ed an  ar ray b ase d  optimization algorithm for mining association rules. The algorithm uses one-dimensional array to count the Candidate 2-itemsets. This method only needs to scan the database once, however, it will consume more memory space to store, and there may be a large number of worthless elements in the established array, which also affected the efficiency of the scanning array. The literature 3 p r o p o s e d a m e th o d th at sp l ittin g  each  r e c o r d th en  saving deposit items to a binary tree. This method also scans the database only once, but it requires a lot of work in the split process, the programming is more complicated To solve the above problem, we propose an improved 
algorithm based on reducing transaction, the algorithm is not only more efficient than the Apriori algorithm and can be easily programmed  II  I DEA OF THE IMPROVED APRIORI  Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman or Times New Roman may be used. If neither is available on your word processor, please use the font closest in appearance to Times. Avoid using bit-mapped fonts if possible. TrueType 1 or Open Type fonts are preferred. Please embed symbol fonts, as well, for math, etc A  The property of the classical Apriori Algorithm After studying we found that the properties of the 
Apriori Algorithm are as follows 1\ll nonempty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent The property used to compress the search space. It can delete the candidate items which inconformity with the property, in order to reduce the quantity of the candidate itemsets which need to participate in scanning the database for cumulative support 2\ When the Apriori algorithm generates frequent K+1\itemsets, the number of the set of frequent Kitemsets is must more than k[4  th a t is   L K  k  Proof: the set of frequent \(K+1\itemsets Ix = {i1 i2,\205,ik+1} must be \(K+1\frequent K-itemsets. if the number of items in the frequent k-itemsets, LK, is less than K+1, then there is no frequent 
k+1 itemsets in the transaction database that be digged Example: frequent 3-itemsets, I A,B,C by the property \(1\,that is that All nonempty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent, must have altogether 3 frequent 2-subsets,that is, AB AC and BC .so the number of itemsets must not less than 3 in L2,i.e. |L2|>2 3\ If the number of element "a" in the frequent Kitemsets, Lk , is less than K, then "a" may not be included in frequent \(K+1\itemsets 978-1-4577-0860-2/11/$26.00 \2512011 IEEE 


 Moreover, we find that the Apriori Algorithm needs lots of judgment for connecting as follows: to judge whether the front K-1 items of the two K-itemsets are same; another, to judge the last item whether different. The operations of judgment and connection will occupy most of the time when the program is running. So, the running efficiency of Apriori Algorithm may be improved, if it can be reduced the times of judgment of conditions and the times of executing connection The Apriori algorithm assumes the items within every record is sorted in lexicographic order, so that candidate itemsets generated by it are ordered, and to compare elements of corresponding position among the candidate itemsets are ordered also, the generated frequent itemsets so such. Therefore, we can use the orderly characteristics among itemsets to reduce the times of connections when the Apriori algorithm is executing, thus to improve efficiency of the algorithm operating B  Improving the Apriori Algorithm On the basis of the above properties, we can propose an improving algorithm based on transaction reduction, the algorithm can be described as follows Input database, D, of transactions; minimum support threshold, min_sup Output L, frequent itemsets in D Main  1\1 = {large1-itemset 2 L1 2  end 3\or\(k=2 Lk+1 k+2;k++\;//By the second property, if Lk-1 k, it impossibly generates frequent k-itemsets, so we can assume the cyclic boundary values by using the property 4  Delete\(Ik,k,Lk,Jk By the third property we can delete the frequent itemsets which impossibly generate higher dimensionality 5\ Ck=apriori_gen \(Jk-1 min_sup\;//to find Jk after handled Lk, then perform the function of apriori-gen\(Jk-1 min_sup\, generate candidate itemsets,Ck 6\or all transactions t D do begin 7\t=Subset\(Ck,t\} // get candidate itemsets, that is the subset of t 8\ For all transactions c Ct   do 9\ c.count 10\end  11\Lk={ c Ck c.count min_sup 12\Answer=UkLk  Procedure apriori_gen\(Jk-1 min_sup\ //the method of generating candidate itemsets, Ck, by Jk 1\or all items I1 Jk-1 2\or all items I2 Jk-1 3\  {if \(\(I1  I 2 1  I1[2 I 2[2    I1[k I 2  K 2  I1[k-1 I 2 k-1   do 4\     c=I1  I2;//connect two itemsets 5\      else break;// by the ordered property of itemset the later itemsets of I2 can not be merged with I1   6\if has_infrequent_itemset\(c,Jk-1 7\ delete c;//delete infrequent itemset 8\ else Ck=C1  c};//to incorporate c into Ck  Procedure has_infrequent_itemset\(c,Jk-1\//the idea of clearing away candidate itemsets which the subsets are infrequent itemsets 1\ for all \(k-1\subset s of c 2\   if  s  Jk-1   return true 3\   else  return false Procedure Delete\(Ik,k,Lk,JK 1\incount=min Lk\(b to count the number of every element in Lk ,where b Ik,Ik Lk 2\hile\(\(Ik  mincount< k 3\ for all items a Ik 4\   if Lk\(a k 5\   Ik=Ik-{a};    Jk=Lk-{P};//to delete all frequent itemsets, P, of containing element, a, in Lk  return Jk  The above algorithm reduces the times of judgment for connecting, at the same time ,it deletes the subsets of impossibly generating higher frequent itemsets before connecting higher candidate itemsets, like this, it can reduce the cost of connection , so the efficiency of algorithm is improved. Furthermore, comparing with the Apriori algorithm, it only adds the subprogram Delete\(Ik,k,Lk,Jk\,to the fourth step of main program, and adds breaking out of an iteration statement to the fifth step of the subprogram, apriori_gen\(Jk-1 min_sup\, these are prone to programming and implementation, and no additional storage space  III  E FFICIENT ANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION  A  Efficient analysis of the algorithm We use the following table 1 which shows the frequent itemsets L2 to analyze the efficiency of the new algorithm Minimum support is set to 2  TABLE I  L2 FREQUENT ITEMSETS  Itemsets Support count I1,I2 4 I1,I3 4 I1,I5 2 I2,I3 4 I2,I4 2 I2,I5 2  First of all, when the Apriori algorithm determines the itemsets whether can be connected,\(I1,I2\must be compared with five itemsets, however, the updated algorithm will exit the loop after \(I1,I2\ is judged to be unable to connect to \(I2,I3\,at this time,\(I1,I2\ has only compared with three itemsets. For the L2 frequent itemsets, the Apriori algorithm needs fifteen times in comparative and judgment, the updated algorithm needs only nine times, it is nearly less half of work than the Apriori algorithm 


 Secondly, the Apriori algorithm join to generate a candidate set C3, the join result is C3 I1,I2,I3},{I1,I2,I5},{I1,I3,I5},{I2,I3,I4},{I2,I3,I5},{I2,I 4,I5 According to the updated algorithm, since only one I4 in the L2,the number is less than two, so we can first removed \(I2,I4\m the L2 before connection, so that we have C3={{I1,I2,I3},{I1,I2,I5},{I1,I3,I5},{I2,I3,I5}}.Thus we don’t need to find the subsets of \(I2,I3,I4\and I2,I4,I5\,and no need to judge whether each subset is frequent itemset, clearly no need to pruning. Here the updated algorithm has reduced the time of comparing and connecting of candidate item, that can improve the efficiency of the mining B  Experimental validation In order to compare the efficiency of the two algorithm from different aspects, I wrote the procedures for the two algorithms. Programs were running on Celeron CPU 2.66GHz, 80G HDD, 512M RAM, Matlab software. The data for mining is 11 specialty course grade of 135 students Support counts were taken 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. In order to avoid the influence of the system speed, I got an average time by repeatedly running the program with the same support count. Comparison of the efficiency shown in Figure 1 From Figure 1 we can find that the efficiency of the two algorithms is in the relatively small difference with a high support, but the new algorithm’s efficiency is increased very significantly when the support is reduced Next, the two programs running on different number of records with a same support count, I got an average time of running the program several times with the same record number. Comparison of the efficiency shown in Figure 2 From Figure 2 we can find that the efficiency of the two algorithms is in the relatively small difference with a small number of records, but the new algorithm’s efficiency is increased very significantly with a large number of records IV  C ONCLUSION  To solve the problems of some other Apriori’s optimization algorithms, this paper presents an Apriori’s optimization algorithm based on reducing transaction. The algorithm is prone to programming and implementation and no additional storage space. The experimental results show that the new algorithm more efficient than the classical Apriori algorithm. Obviously, it is a practical and efficient algorithm for mining association rules  R EFERENCES   1  Yang jianbing Improvement and Realization of Association Rule Mining Algorithm in Data Mining [J Mi c r oc om put er Information.2006,7-3\(22 2  Li rui Kang liangyu Geng hao array-based optimization algorithm for mining association rules [J  S c ie n c e T e chno l o gy an d  Engineering.2008 21\(8 3  Wu zhen guang An Improved Algorithm of Data Mining Based on Association Rule of Frequent Itemstes [J   Co m p ute r  Science.2007,9\(34 4  Wang baisheng,Liu hanbing,Jin shuhe etc. Matrix-based algorithm for mining association rules [J   M i c r oc om p u t e r I n form a t i o n  20 07 24\(05—3\: 144—145 5  Fang yi Zhang chunyuan The Analysis Methods of the Course Test Result of Graduate Education Based on Data Mining [J   Computer Engineering & Science.2009,31\(6 6  Jiawei Han ,Micheline Kamber Fan ming Meng xiaofeng translate Data Mining Concepts and Techniques  b e i j i n g China Machine Press 2007

because of the multiplicity of Java IO APIs over Java Concurrent APIs Note that the y-axis of the left 002gure of Figure 4\(a and 4\(b is in logarithmic scale For IO association rule generation Figure 4\(c shows that the running time grows in a small range of 003uctuation with the increase of min  conf  It can be inferred that pattern mining dominate the whole process rather than rule generation On the other hand the number of rules generated gets approximately linear decrease with the increase of min  conf  Figure 5 shows some interesting resource usage patterns mined Note that the numbers indicates their temporal relationship Fig 5 Resource Usage Pattern Examples C Verifying Result To verify the mined patterns we have identi\002ed 7 IO related resource leak issues from bug tracking systems of Cassandra and Lucene For each issue we learn when it is introduced when it is 002xed how many revisions and how long time it takes to 002x the issue We check out the buggy project revision run the causing test case and generate leaky trace using our tracer Then we feed the leaky trace to our rule checker The ruler checker takes in the rules as well as the leaky traces and checks for violations We calculate the number of issues that has been detected as well as the number that has not been detected For those issues that have not been detected we analyzes why they have not been detected The results are listed in table III For each issue the second column re\003ects the revision when it is introduced while the third column describes the revision when it is 002xed The 223 RP 224 Column lists the total number of project revisions it takes to 002x it The 223 Duration 224 Column gives its duration The sixth column lists the 002les that are polluted The seventh column explains it in natural language The last column shows whether it is detected or not From the table we have the following observations First the duration of listed issues vary a great deal It is to our surprise that the average  RP and durations for the 7 issues are 385 and 377 days respectively In the worst case it takes 2295 revisions and 2527 days to 002x issue LUCENE1455 although it is a simple stream not close leak Second among 7 issues 4 are detected 2 are partially detected and 1 is not detected In the 4 detected issues CASSANDRA313 LUCENE-720 and LUCENE-1374 eventually violate the rule 1 java.io.RandomAccessFile.open  java.io.RandomAccessFile.close and LUCENE-1455 eventually violates the rule 1 java.io.File.<init 2 java.io.FileInputStream.<init  java.io.FileInputStream.close CASSANDRA-71 and CASSANDRA-1188 are also attributed to missing of java.io.RandomAccessFile.close  However we are not able to genereate the leaky trace by running any of CASSANDRA's unit test case Therefore we have to manually design a test case to reproduce it We regard these issues as partially detected In this case our approach is not competitive because designing such test case requires manual work and might be tricky For issue LUCENE-2106 we have successfully generated the leaky trace by running its test case However no violation to any of our rules is reported We studied the trace carefully and found that rather than calling a java.io.Reader object in standard Java API LUCENE itself has implemented a reader class that has the same functionality as java.io.Reader  Therefore no standard Java resource API usage pattern is violated which means our approach is not applicable in this case V R ELATED W ORK To mine API usage DynaMine analyzes source code check-ins to 002nd highly correlated method call pairs Michail et al mine library reuse patterns using gener alized association rules PR-Miner uses frequent item set mining to extract implicit programming rules such as functions variables and data types MAPO uses code search engines to gather source 002les and mines sequential usage patterns to a given query Kagdi et al mine frequently appearing ordered sets patterns of function-call usages considering control constructs such as if-statements Acharya et al present a frame w ork to automatically extract usage scenarios among user-speci\002ed APIs as partial orders Williams et al mine source code repository to detect a commonly 002xed bug Chow et al conduct an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of data mining software code defects in large software repository To infer speci\002cations Yang et al introduce a technique to dynamic infer alternating patterns from execution traces Zhong et al infer resource usage speci\002cations from natural language API documentations Gabel et al  propose a symbolic algorithm based on binary decision diagrams to mine temporal speci\002cations from execution traces Igarashi et al formalize a general problem of analyzing resource usage and propose a type-based solution to the problem Lo et al propose a speci\002cation mining architecture with trace 002ltering and clustering to improve

mining procedures. Our motivation in this study is to utilize the redundancy for extracting algorithm of fuzzy association rules IV. IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON If max{Conf\(Z ? y X ? y max{CF\(Z ? y X ? y ZEQ Proof From the assumption, there exist P E Q that satisfY Con/\(P ? y X ? Y P ? y 0: CF\(X ? Y CF\(X ? y P ? Y Z ? V ZEQ 70 The necessary point in the Apriori algorithm for extracting association rules is to generate the frequent item sets efficiently Though the confidence of the association rules are calculated mally after all decision of frequent itemsets in traditional Apriori algorithm, the basic idea of our proposal is that the confidence of the rule can be calculated after each step A3 in the Apriori algorithm and used for pruning the redundant itemsets. The issue is to decide which itemset should be pruned utilizing the confidence information. Then we define "strong redundant rule" and "strong redundant itemset Confidence 1.0 2 3 4 The number of items Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of Pruning Method Definition 2: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X and Yare fuzzy item sets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X If min\(ConJ\(Z ?Y X ?Y ZEQ X ?

Since the Apriori algorithm generates the candidate itemsets in tum from l-itemsets, the pruning based 


on the redundancy should be performed simultaneously In addition to the basic Apriori algorithm, the following procedures are employed for k> I as A4 confidence of k-rule based on Lk and Lk.j AS The concept of the procedure is that the confidence value of rule should increase by increasing the number of antecedent items. In other words, the procedure is based on valid heuristics that the combination of items in antecedent part which deteriorates the confidence value will become redundant in the following iterations. We can expect reduction of computational time and redundant rules pruning by the additional procedures It should be noted that the confidence calculation in each iteration does not lead to the increase of overall calculation time in association rules mining v. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES We develop the fuzzy mining system based on the redundancy pruning and evaluate the proposed algorithms through numerical examples. We apply the system to "abalone data" available from the vcr Machine Learning Repository[7 The abalone data set consists of 4177 measured data with 1 nominal attribute and 8 continuous attributes as shown in 71 Table. I. In the experiments, the nominal attribute is transformed to the continuous attribute. Table 2\(a statistics and the fuzzy partition information of attributes are summarized in Table 2\(b wider than the actual data distribution for performance evaluation. The fuzzy partition example is shown in Fig.3. We use two types of fuzzy sets with different width, i.e. triangle type and trapezoid type. Although it is better to use the factor such as "interesting" for pruning the derived rules in addition we apply the native association rule extraction for proposed algorithm evaluation.

The number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm Fig.5 shows the results of reduction of itemsets by the proposed algorithm. We can see that fair itemsets are pruned by the proposed method. Fig.6 shows the number of extracted rules by the conventional Apriori algorithm. Many redundant rules are extracted as well as the necessary non-redundant rules Our issue is to restrain the extraction of redundant rules. Fig.7 shows the results of the number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm. Some redundant rules are deleted simultaneously along with frequent itemsets extraction However, since a few non-redundant rules are also unexpectedly deleted at the lower threshold value of minimal confidence, we have to investigate further about heuristics, i.e strong redundant itemsts and relation of threshold values. It should be noted that the number of deleted rules has less dependence on the minimal confidence These results are promising in terms of computational time and redundant rules pruning. However, the improvement is limited in terms of computational time. We consider that the performance of the proposed method must be improved by applying the output field specification method[17]. We expect that the number of pruned rules becomes larger based on the specifications. Moreover, the other measures to prevent redundant rules extraction in fuzzy association rules mining 


could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules mining REFERENCES I] R.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
