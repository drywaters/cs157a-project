After simple comparison of the real example, we prove the comparative superiority of introducing significance into the customer segmentation Keywords-Customer segmentation Methods;Association rules Support Significance I   I NTRODUCTION  Although the mining association rules based on supportconfidence system has been generally accepted and widely applied, as a empirical method, it lacks rigorous theoretical basis, the corresponding parameter settings also lack the objective criteria and statistical validation 1 In addition customer segmentation data has big difference compared to the method commonly used in areas such as medicine and engineering data 2 In medical and engineering problems, no 
matter how deep the rules hide, how difficult the knowledge express,  there is an inherent causal link between attributes and classes, they can show certain regularity, but the customer behavior in customer relationship management always only present a statistical law 3. Therefore, the thesis proposed the association rules classified method which is based on strict statistical significance; it is more suitable for application to the customer segmentation II  S IGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION RULES  In statistics, T test is a classical significance test method This simple and effective statistical methods can also be used to rate the significance of different tests Setting S with n samples, which have k n objects with

In the mining association rules based on support-significant degree, the rules are all significant mining association rules that means only when a mining association rules is a significant rule, it will be returned to the policy makers as the result, or adds to rule base III  THE MINING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURE  The thesis proposes a classification rules associated with generation algorithm based on support - significant degree structure, improved from support-confidence algorithm basis CASA algorithm The improved method is that the classification association rule mining process uses support - significant degree of evaluation, replaces the current degree of support - confidence index. Due to the significant degree of indicators have clear statistical significance, so that the decision index of the generated rules becomes objective Definition 3 Association rule as Y X is called classified association rules, which X is the condition of item sets Y y  is the class label, \(X, Y\ is the rules item set Definition 4 For a classified association rule Y X the appear frequency in database of conditional item set X is conditional support count, when a conditional support count of item set is greater than or equal to the minimum support count the condition is known as frequent conditional item; the number of occurrences for rules set \( X, Y\ in the database are known as the rule support count, when a rule item set support count is greater than or equal to the minimum support count, it is called frequent item sets; when the number of occurrences of a classified label in the database is greater than or equal to the minimum support count, such class labels are called frequent class Definition 5 When a classified item sets of frequent rules item sets meets the minimum significant degree conditions, it is called the rule of significant classified association In the following part, we will propose the classified mining association rules, the assumptions of the database D is a relational thing that contains the relevant data sheet. The database contains N cases and L attributes, these N cases are divided into Q known classes. In the same time, we assume that these attributes are attributes of discrete value, through discreting, we can get corresponding discrete value with continuous values, the discretization of continuous attributes can map continuous value of the property value into the corresponding discrete, and we can use width discrete method deep discrete method, entropy method and other methods to discrete continuous attributes CASA algorithm scans the data several rounds and generates all the frequent rules item sets The goal of proposed mining association rules algorithm is mining significant rules, the specific algorithm process is divided into the following steps 1\ind all frequent item sets: the appearance frequency of the item set is at least the same as the minimum support count 2\e classified association rules generated by frequent item sets: these rules must satisfy the minimum support and the minimum significant degree In the calculation process, firstly, calculate all frequent sets in the data set, identify candidate classes according to frequent sets, for each target class, scan the database, and propose support conditions test. Doing significance degree condition test, if the rule meet the support.degree. The rule which both meet significant degree and support conditions rules regard as significant class association rules and put into the knowledge base In the following part, we will give classified association rules in the framework of support-significant degree, that is, the algorithm of significant association classification rules Algorithm CASA  algorithm  Input I related database D II minimum support threshold Min_sup III Significance level value Min_Sig Output Significant classification association rules SCAR Procedure CASA \(D, Min_sup, Min_lift 1\ Public Integer n=|D 2\ F0=find_frequent_class\(D 3\ For each class-i  F0  sup i class p i c     4\ F1={frequent 1-ruleitems 5\ SCAR1=Signrule_Gen\(F1 6\ prSCAR1=prunerules\(SCAR1 7\ for\(k=2    1 k F FK-1;k++\ do 8\ Ck=candidate_Gen\(Fk-1 ,Min_sup 9\ For each datacase d  D do 10 d C rulesubset k C d 11\ for each candidate d c c  do 12\ c.condsupcount 13\ if d.class=c.class then c.rulesupcount 14\ }//end of for 11 15\ }//end of for 9 16   sup min_ sup      count rul c C c F K k  17 k SCAR SingRule_gen k F  18 k PrCAR prunerules k F  19\ }//end of for 7

Rules    X  d  Disease    W  romdisease sufferingf worktypeA job  According to the data in Table 1, we can calculate the support degree of this rule is 2.08%, it is greater than the minimum of support degree, while the 7.56% confidence level is less than the minimum confidence. Because the rule does not meet the minimum confidence level, the rule in this framework will not be returned to the policy makers as a strong rule. However, we have noticed that the ratio of workers with job type A suffering from disease X is 3 times than the average prevalence rate of this disease, this difference has reached a statistically significant level. Therefore, this rule which is ignored is a useful practical rule, but it is not found out in the abovementioned mining algorithm However, if we use the association rule generation algorithm which based on support-significant degree to recalculate, we can obtain the following results Suppose the minimum support and candidate rules are the same to the above-mentioned algorithm, the significant level set at 1%, according to the above mining algorithms, we can get: the 2.08% support degree is greater than the minimum support degree, while the 16.06 confidence degrees was greater than the minimum significant level. Therefore, the rules is significant, the candidate rules will be added to the collection as a significant rule V  C ONCLUSION  Based on the shortage of support - confidence framework mining association rules, this thesis proposes a new mining association rule method, which is based on support - significant degree structure of mining association rules framework. The data mining method puts forward a new rule evaluation index --significant index. In the process of mining rules, it substitutes confidence indicators. The major improvements of the approach is that we use T test with the significance of the confidence index from the statistics instead of the original index based on confidence indicators rules, therefore, the determine indicators of the rules have objective standard Based on actual test data analysis, this method has good practical effect in customer segmentation R EFERENCES   1  H.

Members endowments Familys endowments Attitude of families to IT Attitude of neighbours to IT Adoption attention Fig.1.Information technology adoption model based on farmers endowments From the results above, age, education, family income family communication cost and job type affect farmers capacity of information technology adoption. Moreover perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude of neighbors to techniques affect farmers intention. Therefore the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9 factors to study farmers endowments impact on information technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based on association rules 1 Association rules are to look for the relationship among different variables in the database, and find out the frequent mode [11 Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains A, i.e. TA Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets of items A and B are called antecedent \(left-hand-side or LHS and consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS respectively Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contains the itemset, i.e BAPS Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  ABP Association rules generation is usually split up into two 


separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

SMS = yes a technique while job=farmer, family communication channels middle, family communication cost = middle and family income =middle. The association rules reflect weak relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However farmers are still afraid of getting fake information b technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and selling production, family income = high and public communication channels = wide. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers job, age and family income. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, this technique costs much c 


while age=young, education=high, family communication cost=middle and family income=high. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Rules extracted from the third experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and geographical regions are identified The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  6. Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
