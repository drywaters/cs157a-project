between these two con\003icting power limited requirements so as to minimize the average error probability of the system and at the same time enable accurate RS observations Obviously there always exists an optimum split of the total power into the two components mentioned above if the cost is a function only of error probability When the cost is a function of probability of error and quality of RS data there could exist an optimum phase modulation index corresponding to required average error probability performance while satisfying the required RS data accuracy For certain missions that use high data rates the available bandwidth might be a limiting factor In such cases it is preferred to use a completely suppressed carrier system that is more bandwidth ef\002cient Currently RS measurements are performed by using only a residual carrier scheme When a carrier signal is passing through the atmosphere of a planet atmospheric information is extracted from the amplitude and phase variations of the received carrier For certain critical missions pure carrier transmission without data might be used for some duration of time to enhance the quality of received RS observations In this paper we consider a pure suppressed carrier system and we restrict the modulation to be Binary Phase Shift Keying 050BPSK\051 However extension to other modulations such as M-ary Phase-Shift Keying 050MPSK\051 is possible We already presented a method to remove the data from the received suppressed carrier and effectively generate a residual carrier for Radio Science from the received suppressed carrier data for estimating the amplitude and phase variations F or an uncoded BPSK system a simple way to remove data is to square the received baseband samples Using this method provides the estimate of twice of the actual phase Thus this method creates a phase ambiguity that requires unwrapping the estimated phase With such a scheme there is also performance degradation due to the squaring of noisy samples For coded systems fortunately this is not the case The existing coding schemes for space communications include convolutional codes concatenated Reed-Solomon and convolutional codes turbo codes and Low-Density Parity-Check 050LDPC\051 codes The proposed method takes the hard output of the decoder to remove the data from the incoming signal after re-encoding and remodulating For optical case this process is done after photo detectors Since known delays can be calibrated out of RS observations the process of data removal can also be done in several iterations We analyze the received data using open loop estimation techniques for amplitude and phase Results will be parametrically represented so that it can represent all the different cases of interest to RS observations In section 2 we provide the received signal models in section 3 we provide a background review on the Cramer-Rao bound The goal was to obtain a lower bound on minimum variance of unbiased estimation of parameters related to Radio Science data for the suppressed carrier Then the theoretical results were compared to the residual carrier case In section 4 maximum likelihood estimators are derived to extract the Radio Science data In section 5 we propose an optical receiver for both data detection and Radio science measurements for PPM BPSK DMPSK and orthogonal optical signals For each type of modulation we have shown the structure of the optical receiver Section 6 provides a summary 2 C HANNEL AND SIGNAL M ODELS For suppressed carrier BPSK modulation the complex envelope of the received signal in the absence of planetary atmosphere can be modeled as y 050 t 051  Ad 050 t 051 e j 0502 031f d t  036 o 051  n 050 t 051 0501\051 where y 050 t 051 is the complex received signal with amplitude A  Doppler frequency shift f d  and carrier phase 036 o  In 0501\051 n 050 t 051 is additive zero mean white Gaussian noise and d 050 t 051 is transmitted data that can be represented as d 050 t 051  X k d k p 050 t 000 kT s 051 0502\051 where p 050 t 051 represents modulation pulse shaping d k 2 f 1  000 1 g for BPSK and T s is the symbol duration In deep space communications usually p 050 t 051 is a rectangular pulse shape such that p 050 t 051  1 0  t 024 T s 0503\051 and zero otherwise Other pulse shaping such as Nyquist pulse shaping can also be considered if there are strict bandwidth limitations When the suppressed carrier BPSK modulation is passed through a planetary atmosphere the received signal can be modeled as y 050 t 051  Aa 050 t 051 d 050 t 051 e j 0502 031f d t  040 050 t 051 036 o 051  n 050 t 051 0504\051 where a 050 t 051 and 040 050 t 051 are the amplitude and phase of Radio Science signal to be measured For residual carrier the complex envelope of the received signal can simply be modeled as y 050 t 051  Aa 050 t 051 e j 0502 031f d t  040 050 t 051 036 o 051  n 050 t 051 0505\051 Comparing 0504\051 and 0505\051 we see that for pure residual carrier the multiplicative term d 050 t 051 is missing The received observation using 0505\051 provides all information required for Radio Science measurements The only nuisance interfering signal is the noise n 050 t 051  However in 0504\051 the data d 050 t 051 represents an additional multiplicative nuisance interfering signal that should be removed In addition to Doppler frequency we are interested in estimating a 050 t 051 and 040 050 t 051  In order to simplify the signal model prior to estimating 040 050 t 051 we can calibrate out the Doppler frequency and 036 o or simply represent the Doppler and 036 o as part of 040 050 t 051 phase Also we assume the received signal can be normalized 050calibrated\051 by A such that E f a 2 050 t 051 g  1  Thus a simpler model for the received signal can be written as r 050 t 051  a 050 t 051 d 050 t 051 e j\040 050 t 051  n 050 t 051 0506\051 The discrete time model for signal in 0506\051 at a symbol sample rate can be represented as r  s 050 a  040  d 051  n 0507\051 where the k th component of r can be represented as r k  a k d k e 040 k  n k 0508\051 Suppose the estimation of time varying amplitude and phase is done over windows of N samples Since these parameters are slowly varying in practice we can make the following approximations for the amplitude and phase processes Over every N samples we assume the amplitude a is almost constant and phase can have a linear approximation The estimated amplitude and phase 050with possible phase unwrapping\051 over consecutive windows will represent the time varying amplitude and phase if the number of samples per window frame is chosen properly Without loss of generality consider the time index for a given window to be k  0  1  2     050 N 000 1\051

Over this window then a k  a  and 040 k  2 031\040 1 k 001  040 0 where 040 0 is the initial phase at the beginning of the window i.e at k  0  040 1 represents the slope of the phase and 001 is the sampling period 050here it is equal to T s 051 In fact we used piecewise line 002tting for the phase over every N samples In 0508\051 the n k s are independent and identically distributed zero mean noise samples with variance 033 2  N o  2 E s per dimension The symbol energy is given by E s  P T s where P is the averaged received power Note that the variance of noise after normalization is correctly done since if we set a  1  and 040 1  040 0  0  by passing the received samples r k through a hard limiter we get exactly the performance of uncoded coherent BPSK modulation With this setup we have a simpler signal model to be used in our theoretical analysis The received vector is modeled as r  s 050 022  d 051  n 0509\051 where the vector parameter 022  050 022 1  022 2  022 3 051  050 a 040 0  040 1 051 to be estimated given the received complex observation samples r k  ad k e j 0502 031\040 1 k 001 040 0 051  n k 05010\051 For wiping out the data we use a genie argument Assume for every received sample a genie tells us the correct value of data d k with probability of 1 000 p and incorrect value with probability of p  This is equivalent to having p 050 d k  1\051  1 000 p and p 050 d k  000 1\051  p  Using the genie argument 050hiring a genie\051 simpli\002es our theoretical analysis In a real implementation of the system we replace the genie 050\002ring the genie\051 with the channel decoder output that provides the same information for non-ideally wiping out the data The vector r represents the N received observations samples for index set k  0  1      050 N 000 1\051  The model of received observation vector r depends on the vector data vector d  which acts as an unwanted nuisance vector in estimation of 022  Thus the probability density function p 050 r j 022 051 can be obtained as p 050 r j 022 051  E d f p 050 r j 022  d 051 g 05011\051 Based on the observation model for suppressed carrier BPSK modulation over AWGN channel and the model of amplitude and phase we have p 050 r j 022  d 051  N 000 1 Y k 0 p 050 r k j 022  d k 051 05012\051 where p 050 r k j 022  d k 051  1  2 031\033 2 e 000 1  2 033 2 j r k 000 ad k e j 0502 031\040 1 k 001 040 0 051 j 2 05013\051 For BPSK modulation data d k is taking values of 1  000 1  Using a genie argument where the genie is not reliable as discussed above we have p 050 d k  1\051  1 000 p and p 050 d k  000 1\051  p where the genie lies independently with probability p  then using 05011\051 we have E d k f p 050 r k j 022  d k 051 g  p 050 r k j 022  d k  1\051\0501 000 p 051  p 050 r k j 022  d k  000 1\051 p 05014\051 Using 05011\051 and 05012\051 we have p 050 r j 022 051  N 000 1 Y k 0 E d k f p 050 r k j 022  d k 051 g 05015\051 Thus ln p 050 r j 022 051  N 000 1 X k 0 ln E d k f p 050 r k j 022  d k 051 g 05016\051 Using 05013\051 and 05014\051 we obtain ln E d k f p 050 r k j 022  d k 051 g  ln p  p 0501 000 p 051  2 031\033 2 000 j r k j 2  a 2  2 033 2  ln cosh\050 z k 050 r k  022  p 051\051 05017\051 where z k 050 r k  022  p 051  a  033 2 f r k 014 003 k g  ln r  1 000 p  p 05018\051 and 014 k  e j 0502 031\040 1 k 001 040 0 051 05019\051 3 B ACKGROUND R EVIEW ON C RAMER R AO B OUND The Cramer-Rao bound 050CRB\051 2 3 in estimation theory provides the tightest achievable lower bound on the mean square error of an unbiased estimator The CRB for a vector parameter estimation in additive white Gaussian noise in the absence of other nuisance random vectors has already been done and there is nothing new However a closed form solution of the CRB for vector parameter or even for a single parameter estimation when there is a nuisance random vector such as a non-uniform 050not equally likely\051 random data is hard Fortunately in 2013 we solved the problem and a closed form solution has been provided Consider estimating a vector parameter 022  050 022 1  022 2      022 q 051 T  Assume that the estimator  022 is unbiased Using the CramerRao bound we have var 050  022 i 051 025  I 000 1 050 022  i;i 05020\051 where I 050 022 051 is the q 002 q Fisher information matrix where the 050 ij 051 component of I 050 022 051 is de\002ned as  I 050 022  i;j  000 E r f  2 ln p 050 r j 022 051  022 i 022 j g 05021\051 for i j  1  2      q and it is evaluated at the true value of 022  In we obtained CRB for suppressed carrier modulation In we ha v e sho wn that for the residual carrier case p  0  the CRB reduces to var 050  022 1 051 025 033 2  N  050CRB\051 res  1 05022\051 var 050  022 2 051 025 4 033 2  N a 2  050CRB\051 res  2 05023\051 var 050  022 3 051 025 12 033 2  N a 2 0502 031 001 N 051 2  050CRB\051 res  3 05024\051 3

of optical receiver for DPSK modulation is shown in Fig 7 So for both modulations the data can be estimated For coded optical modulation the observations I 2  Q 2 are used for PPM and the measurements I k I k 000 1  Q k Q k 000 1 for DPSK case can provide soft observables to the decoder Similar system as in Fig 2 can be proposed to wipe out the data for Radio Science measurements In the 002gures the decoded and remodulated data are used to wipe out the data on the received I k and Q k signals for Radio Science measurements After wiping out the data from I and Q we can use these two measurements to estimate amplitude phase and frequency changes due to the planetary atmosphere for Radio Science For modulations such as differentially encoded MPSK 050DMPSK\051 we can implement a circuit that performs the following operation 050 I k  jQ k 051\050 I k 000 1 000 jQ k 000 1 051  The real and imaginary parts of this operation provide the required signals to the decoder In general for DMPSK a hard or soft Multiple Symbol Differential Detector can be used 050see Fig 8\051 If the transmitted laser phase modulated signal over multiple symbols represent an orthogonal signal set then there is no need for differential encoder for such signals At the optical receiver a 050hard or soft\051 multiple symbol detector can be used 6 S UMMARY In this paper we derived three equations to be solved to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of amplitude phase and frequency for Radio Science data We proposed a novel optical receiver that detects data then removes the nuisance data from the received optical signal and provides observations to be used for Radio Science measurements A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of
