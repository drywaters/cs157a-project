text or graphical displays that incorporate individual parameter limit checking or simple trend analysis Mission control engineering support groups are available to perform more in depth analysis of collected telemetry to assess system health or to explain unusual phenomena observed in system behavior Recent developments in data mining techniques for anomaly detection make it possible to use the wealth of archived spacecraft system data to produce advanced system health monitoring applications that can 
aid mission controllers and engineering analysts in their tasks These data driven applications are capable of characterizing and monitoring interactions between multiple parameters and can provide valuable decision support for mission controllers and engineers Several data driven software tools including Orca and the Inductive Monitoring System IMS have been successfully applied to mission operations for both the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station Orca 1 is a data mining tool that searches for unusual data points or outliers in 
multivariate data sets by calculating the distance of each data point from neighboring points The presence of outliers in spacecraft system data is of interest to mission controllers because they may indicate malfunctioning system components The IMS tool 2 uses a data mining technique called clustering to analyze archived spacecraft data and characterize nominal interactions between selected parameters This characterization or model of normal operation is stored in a knowledge base that can be used for 1 


real time system monitoring or analysis of archived events Spacecraft data is compared with the nominal model built by IMS to produce a measure of how well the data matches the normal behavior defined by the training data Significant deviations from the nominal system model can alert the controller to a system malfunction or precursor to a significant failure Supplementing current mission control software with advanced monitoring tools such as Orca and IMS can provide controllers and engineers with greater insight into the health and performance of the space systems under their watch The addition of heuristic rule based methods that encode system knowledge obtained from seasoned mission controllers can also be helpful to less experienced personnel We will discuss how these tools and techniques have been used to complement existing NASA mission control practices and present plans for future mission control system health monitoring software deployments using these technologies 2 STANDARD MCC SOFTWARE TOOLS The NASA Mission Control Center MCC at the Johnson Space Center JSC employs a standard suite of certified software tools in the flight control rooms Individual controller disciplines may also introduce specialized software tools suitable for their particular task Core software applications used for data monitoring in the MCC include the Information Sharing Protocol ISP data distribution system the MSK-View and RTPLOT data display tools the ELOG event logging utility and the ISPATOM computation tool Information Sharing Protocol ISP The Information Sharing Protocol ISP software is a distributed system that supports real-time telemetry distribution and messaging in the MCC 3 It is the primary spacecraft data feed for the mission control consoles In addition to subscribing to telemetry data console applications can publish values to ISP to allow other software applications to subscribe to and use locally computed results along with the real-time telemetry data MSKView MSK-View is a program used to display ISP data in a tabular format defined in a screen configuration file 4 Figure 1 shows an example of a display created with MSKView It allows the user to define screens with alphanumeric labels and parameter values along with simple line drawings and screen navigation buttons Each object on the screen can be assigned a color as well The MSKView application can subscribe to an ISP data feed and provide a text display Figure 1 Sample MSKView Screen of real-time data values as they are received In addition the display can show different user defined text strings based on the value of a data parameter For instance a display element can be defined to display HIGH if a data value exceeds a high limit value and LOW if it is less than a low limit value This gives controllers a way to detect off nominal parameters on their MSK-View screens using predetermined limit values RTPLOT The RTPLOT Real Time Plot program provides a means of plotting real-time or played-backed data accessed via the ISP data feed 5 RTPLOT subscribes to the ISP data stream and provides line plots of one or more parameter values over time Figure 2 It allows the user to define upper and lower limits for each plot which appear as red dashed lines on the plot display The plot can be iconified to a smaller size to conserve screen real estate If a parameter on an iconified plot falls outside a limit the plot name on the icon will be displayed in red to alert controllers of the out of limit condition RTPLOT also includes routines to estimate future data values by fitting lines or parabolic curves to previously plotted data 2 


P igure 2 Nample KI vLUJ iLsplay ELOG The ELOG event logger program provides a means to automatically log telemetry change events in real time 6 ELOG defines an event as a comparison greater than equal to etc between an ISP parameter value and a constant When the comparison is true for a specified amount of time the event is logged to a file and displayed in a list on the controller's screen The display will show the time the event occurred and a text message describing the event with a user selected background color Figure 3 The controller can acknowledge that they have seen an event in the ELOG display by clicking on that list item with the mouse An acknowledged event will be displayed in reverse video Audible alarms can be associated with critical events to attract the controller's attention Like RTPLOT the ELOG display windows can be iconified to save screen space An ELOG icon will show the name of the window a count of how many events have been logged in that window and a count of how many of those events have not been acknowledged ATOM The Advanced Tool of Math ATOM is a software tool that allows controllers to define and execute real time computations on telemetry data by specifying equations using ISP parameter identifiers 7 ATOM will parse the user defined equation subscribe to the required real-time telemetry values calculate results as new data arrives and publish the results back to ISP for use by other applications ATOM provides common mathematical and comparison functions including square root logarithmic and trigonometric functions It can also perform calculations on time series data such as average standard deviation and future value prediction using a least squares line fit Program flow control is provided by IF WHILE and CASE statements Basic data structures like arrays and stacks can also be used in the calculations 3 DATA MINING FOR MISSION CONTROL NASA maintains years of archived Space Shuttle and International Space Station ISS telemetry data in the Operational Data Reduction Complex ODRC at the Johnson Space Center This archive can provide a wealth of information about the behavior of individual telemetry parameters and how those parameters correlate to each other The standard suite of mission control software tools is able to convey current data and system status to controllers but takes little advantage of information available on the historic behavior and interactions of the parameters Methods from the field of data mining are useful for analyzing and characterizing the type of data found in the ODRC archive In particular recent developments in data driven anomaly detection techniques can process the data to find unusual events or outliers in data for a given subsystem These anomaly detection techniques can also automatically analyze archived nominal system data to characterize normal system performance Comparing incoming real-time data to that nominal model can let the user know if the current system behavior differs from previous system performance One powerful feature of these data mining techniques is the ability to simultaneously analyze multiple parameters This allows them to discover and model interactions between related parameters that might be difficult to notice when monitoring those parameters individually 4 ORCA DISTANCE-BASED OUTLIER DETECTION Orca is a data mining tool that analyzes multivariate data sets 1 It uses a nearest neighbor approach to outlier detection Each group of parameter values is considered a vector that defines a point in a multi-dimensional vector space For each point in the data set Orca locates other points in the data set that are closest to that point called the point's nearest neighbors Distance between points is measured with the Euclidean distance measure The program outputs a score for each point representing the average distance to the nearest k neighbors in the data set The value of k is specified by the user Points that have a larger average distance to their nearest neighbors than most other points in the data set are considered outliers The Orca program is able to find outliers within a single data set or compare one data set with another to determine which 3 l l 


points in the first data set are unusual in comparison to the second set One approach to using Orca with spacecraft telemetry is to form data vectors by grouping a number of concurrent parameter values collected from sensors on a given spacecraft subsystem and searching for outliers among those vectors For instance vectors could be formed from temperature pressure and fuel flow rates in a rocket engine Values collected simultaneously at regular time intervals from each of the sensors would form the data set An Orca analysis of this data set can locate data from time periods during the engine firing that display unusual characteristics compared with the rest of the data Those anomalous data points may be symptoms of engine malfunctions such as a faulty pressure regulator or an incorrect fuel-oxidizer mixture ratio 5 IMS INDUCTIVE MONITORING SYSTEM The Inductive Monitoring System IMS is a tool that uses a data mining technique called clustering to extract models of normal system operation from archived data 2 Like Orca IMS works with vectors of data values IMS analyzes data collected during periods of normal system operation to build a system model It characterizes how the parameters relate to one another during normal operation by finding areas in the vector space where nominal data tends to fall These areas are called nominal operating regions and correspond to clusters of similar points found by the IMS clustering algorithm These nominal operating regions are stored in a knowledge base that IMS uses for real-time telemetry monitoring During system monitoring IMS reads real-time or archived data values formats them into the predefined vector structure and searches the knowledge base of nominal operating regions to see how well the new data fits the nominal system characterization For each input vector IMS returns the distance that vector falls from the nearest nominal operating region Data that matches the normal training data well will have a deviation distance of zero If one or more of the data parameters is slightly outside of expected values a small non-zero result is returned As incoming data deviates further from the normal system data indicating a possible malfunction IMS will return a higher deviation value to alert users of the anomaly IMS also calculates the contribution of each individual parameter to the overall deviation which can help isolate the cause of the anomaly 6 MISSION CONTROL APPLICATIONS The Orca and IMS tools have both been applied in NASA mission control to support real-time telemetry monitoring and engineering analysis of mission data In support of the JSC Mission Evaluation Room MER engineering analysis activity the tools were applied to data from the Space Shuttle Wing Leading Edge Impact Detection System WLEIDS to find potential impact signatures In the Itgu 4 U e ShIk Rin Loding h3de 1imt DLtecution i m 


International Space Station ISS flight control room they have been used to build real-time health monitoring applications for the ISS Control Moment Gyroscopes Space Shuttle Wing Leading Edge Impact Detection System The Shuttle WLEID system was developed in response to the loss of the Columbia orbiter on the STS-107 mission During the launch of STS-107 a piece of foam shed from the Shuttle external fuel tank struck the leading edge of the orbiter's left wing compromising the thermal protection system This damage resulted in the tragic loss of vehicle and crew during reentry due to overheating and failure of the internal wing structure 8 The WLEIDS consists of 132 single axis accelerometers mounted along the length of the orbiter's leading edge wing spars Figure 4 During launch the accelerometers collect data at a rate of 20 KHz and store that data onboard for subsequent downlink to Mission Control Within 6 to 8 hours of launch summary files containing periodic subsamples of the data collected by each accelerometer are down linked to the MER for analysis to find potential impact signatures This analysis must be performed within 24 to 48 hours of the launch so the results can be used to schedule detailed on-orbit wing leading edge inspections using cameras mounted on the Shuttle robotic arm The basic WLEIDS analysis is performed by MER engineers by visually examining three dimensional graphs of the summary data that show accelerometer location and vibration magnitude along a time axis Figure 5 The analysts search the graphs for localized peaks among the normal vibration signals caused by the Shuttle engines and aerodynamic forces Unusual peaks in the data might have been caused by an impact on the wing leading edge When possible impact events are identified a half second of raw data collected by the affected accelerometer at that time is downloaded for more thorough analysis The Orca and IMS tools have been used to support the WLEIDS analysis on three Shuttle launches The goal is to provide a quick initial scan of the WLEIDS summary files to locate unusual points and help focus the MER analysts efforts For each accelerometer sensor vectors were formed from concurrent values collected from that sensor and seven nearby sensors Orca is used to search for outliers within the data collected during the current launch Prior to the launch IMS was used to analyze normal data from previous launches to characterize typical vibration patterns for each group of accelerometers Data from the current launch is DET j Figure 5 Sample WLEIDS Summary File Graph compared to this characterization to identify unusual vibration patterns that might have been caused by impact events To gauge the effectiveness of the data mining tools we compared Orca and IMS results to visual WLEIDS summary file analysis performed by MER engineers on the STS-115 launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis The analysts classify the events they identify as critical probable or questionable based on the likelihood that the data signature was caused by an impact Their analysis of the STS-1 15 launch WLEIDS summary data produced 6 critical events 23 probable events and 2 questionable events The Orca analysis placed all critical events in the top 50 outliers IMS identified 334 interesting events divided nearly evenly between the two wings Those events included all 6 critical events 18 of 23 probable events and all of the questionable events found by the MER analysts Most of the anomalies identified by Orca and IMS that were not noted by the analysts could be eliminated as normal global vibrations that shook the entire vehicle Additionally during all launches where Orca and IMS have been used the tools identified several lower energy vibration signatures that did not stand out in the visual data inspection These events were investigated with raw WLEIDS data downloads from the affected sensors Fortunately all of the potential impact events identified in the WLEIDS data were shown to be the result of non-damaging phenomena such as aerodynamic events or sensor data spikes and all missions concluded with safe and uneventful reentry and landing 5 


ISS Control Moment Gyroscopes The International Space Station ISS Control Moment Gyroscope CMG attitude control system consists of four large gyroscopes each mounted in a gimbal system that can rotate the CMG about the two axes perpendicular to the gyroscope spin axis Figure 6 The CMGs operate as nonpropulsive attitude control devices that exchange momentum with the ISS through induced gyroscopic torques remainder of the data for that CMG were removed These deviations were typically caused by data corruption or minor anomalies in CMG operation Once the archived CMG data had gone through this cleaning process the remaining nominal data was used by IMS to build a monitoring knowledge base for each CMG The IMS monitoring application was integrated with the ISP data server software to access real-time telemetry in the ISS flight control room Four IMS processes one per CMG are run on the ADCO flight control console to provide continuous monitoring Once per second when data is available each IMS process will query the appropriate CMG knowledge base and return the amount of overall deviation if any from the nominal training data It will also return the contribution of each individual parameter to any deviation to aid in isolating the source of the deviation These results are published back to the ISP data stream for access by other software applications Figure 6 ISS Control Moment Gyroscopes As they have aged some of the CMGs have degraded enough to malfunction and require replacement A failed CMG1 was replaced with a new unit in July 2005 and a faulty CMG3 was replaced in August 2007 Given their history the ISS Attitude Determination and Control Officer ADCO flight controllers are interested in detecting early symptoms of degradation in the CMGs A deployment of data driven system health monitoring applications in the ISS flight control room is assisting with that task Working with the ADCO flight controllers 13 CMG parameters were selected for real time monitoring These parameters include CMG vibration bearing temperatures rotation speed gimbal rates electrical current and ISS rotation rates along with rates of change of the temperatures and electrical current Archived data collected over a period of 10 months for CMG1 2 and 4 was analyzed Nine weeks of available data for the recently installed CMG3 was analyzed for that unit The data was sampled at a 1 Hz rate and formed into vectors of 13 values Each CMG was analyzed individually to capture its unique characteristics The ADCO controllers have developed RTPLOT displays to graph the IMS CMG results in real-time on their control console These graphs read the IMS results from the ISP server and show the amount of total IMS deviation over time for each CMG Figure 7 along with the individual parameter contributions The controllers also use ELOG rules to notify them when IMS detects unusual CMG behavior The IMS output acts as a decision aid alerting the controllers to CMG anomalies and prompting them to investigate unusual occurrences It also serves as a cross check for atypical events detected by other means For example when a controller sees a pattern on their telemetry display that is different from what they expect they can check the IMS output for that time period to see if this type of behavior had occurred previously If IMS shows minimal deviation during that time then the current data matches previous behavior seen in the nominal IMS training data If IMS shows a significant deviation during that time further investigation may be warranted The first operation with the CMG data was to remove any anomalies from the archived data This was accomplished by searching for outliers within each data set using the Orca tool Data records with significant deviations relative to the 6 


7 HEURISTIc FAULT IDENTIFICATION The IMS processes monitoring the ISS Control Moment Gyroscopes can alert the controllers when a CMG deviates from typical behavior but the basic IMS routines do not identify the fault that caused the deviation The ADCO controllers would like to receive explicit alerts in the event of particular CMG faults when possible Some of these fault signatures are straightforward enough to encode as monitoring rules and integrate with the IMS console software One relatively common but recoverable CMG fault is a transient condition in the CMG electronics assembly that the ADCO controllers call an EA Fault This event is characterized by a brief electrical current spike beyond a threshold value accompanied by the setting of an error bit in the electronics assembly A routine was added to the IMS monitoring software that watches for the occurrence of an appropriately sized current spike and the setting of the electronics assembly fault bit within a short time window If both of these events occur within that time span IMS will set an EA Fault bit on the ISP data stream to alert the controllers of the incident Another less frequent incident is a Loss of Comm fault that occurs when a CMG experiences problems with the network connection to the ISS computer responsible for commanding the unit and gathering CMG sensor data This event is automatically recognized by ISS on-board fault detection logic which initiates a recovery procedure to reestablish the connection This recovery procedure results in transmission of several specific status messages to the ground controllers Watching for these status changes allows the IMS Loss of Comm detection routine to detect when the event has occurred and set the appropriate alert bit in the ISP data server The routine also detects when a successful recovery has occurred and resets the alert bit Although these heuristic fault identification abilities do not cover all possible fault scenarios they add value by enabling the controller to quickly determine the cause of these more common anomalies This can be particularly useful for less experienced controllers who may not have seen these particular fault signatures Additional fault detection routines may be incorporated in the future 8 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK Through practical application it has been demonstrated that data driven system health monitoring applications can be useful in a space mission operations setting Many spacecraft have extensive archives of telemetry data available that can be advantageously exploited by data mining methods Two data mining tools Orca and the Inductive Monitoring System have been used to analyze data from the Space Shuttle and International Space Station to search for anomalous data points that could be indications of a fault or damage to the spacecraft Providing information on possible system anomalies in a timely manner provides controllers and mission support engineers with helpful decision support and enables more efficient and effective execution of their duties The inclusion of fault identification routines further simplifies their tasks These initial tool deployments in the NASA JSC mission control center have demonstrated the utility and effectiveness of data driven system health monitoring methods in two disciplines but the applications are not limited to just these examples There are many areas with rich archived data repositories where these and similar techniques can be applied Mission controllers from several ISS disciplines including power management thermal control and life support have expressed interest in similar system monitoring tools Now that the software has been integrated with the mission control data systems expansion of the capability is primarily a matter of identifying relevant parameters to monitor and performing the archived data analysis Work is beginning now to develop monitoring capability for ISS thermal control systems Eventually we plan to develop tools that allow mission controllers to build their own data driven monitoring applications They will specify which parameters to monitor what time periods to include in the nominal training data and any computations that should be performed on the raw telemetry data The tool set will retrieve the desired archived training data remove spurious data points using outlier detection and build a new monitoring knowledge base and an appropriate monitoring application configuration to run on their control console A useful enhancement to the current monitoring software would be the ability to automatically detect operating mode changes in the monitored system and switch to a targeted monitoring knowledge base developed specifically for that mode For instance the ISS is flown in different orientations and configurations during different mission phases The behavior of the CMGs can differ in the various configurations Rather than building one large knowledge base per CMG that covers all cases as in the current deployment a separate knowledge base could be built from archived data collected during each ISS configuration then consulted for real-time monitoring when the ISS is in that configuration This would provide more accurate and efficient monitoring capability Another application of data driven monitoring to explore is the use of supervised learning methods to help identify fault signatures If examples of fault behavior are available in the archived data supervised learning algorithms such as decision tree or support vector machine based techniques may be able to analyze the data and distinguish between 7 


different types of fault behavior and normal operation If the monitored system exhibits unusual behavior fault characterizations from the supervised learning algorithm could help controllers identify the cause of the anomaly These techniques could allow automated fault identification in cases that are too complex to be encoded in heuristic rules ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author would like to thank the following collaborators who directly supported and contributed to the development and deployment of the mission control software described in this paper From NASA Ames Research Center Rick Alena Charles Lee SAIC Dawn McIntosh Mark Schwabacher Lilly Spirkovska and William Taylor From NASA Johnson Space Center Tatiana Dobrinskaya USA Ann Esbeck USA Tammy Gafka Joshua Johnson Keith Martin TSI and Charles McCann REFERENCES 1 Stephen D Bay and Mark Schwabacher Mining Distance-Based Outliers in Near Linear Time with Randomization and a Simple Pruning Rule Proceedings of The Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2003 2 David L Iverson Inductive System Health Monitoring Proceedings of The 2004 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence IC-AI04 Las Vegas Nevada June 2004 CSREA Press 9 M Schwabacher N Oza and B Matthews Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Liquid-Fueled Rocket Propulsion Health Monitoring Proceedings of the AIAA Infotech\(4,Aerospace Conference Reston VA American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc 2007 10 R A Martin M Schwabacher N Oza and A Srivastava Comparison of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods for Systems Health Management Using Space Shuttle Main Engine Data  Proceedings of the JANNAF Propulsion Meeting 2007 BIOGRAPHY David Iverson has worked as a computer engineer in the Intelligent Systems Division at the NASA Ames Research Center for more than two decades During most of that time he has been involved in integrated system health management ISHM for spacecraft aircraft and scientific payload systems He has investigated several aspects of this field including reasoning from system fault models model based monitoring and diagnosis and data driven techniques for system monitoring Most recently he has developed and applied the Inductive Monitoring System data driven anomaly detection software He is the NASA Ames project leadfor deployment of data driven monitoring for JSC mission control applications He received his B.S from the University of Puget Sound where he studied Computer Science Mathematics and Physics He also holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University 3 Mission Control Center Platform Services System Information Sharing Protocol User's Guide NASA Document CSOC-JSC-UG-002098 April 2002 4 MSK-View Users Guide Version 3.4 September 1997 5 RTPLOT Reference Guide NASA Operations Document JSC-26101 August 1998 6 ELOG Reference Guide NASA Operations Document JSC-26101 July 1998 7 Adam Dershowitz Advanced Tool of Math ATOM Users Guide Version 02.03.06 July 2006 8 Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report Volume 1 August 2003 8

Such optimizati ons often cause incorrect rearrangement of instructions and o veroptimization of data accesses For this matter cert ain modification are required in the software, some of which are very obscure These necessary modifications are dis cussed in detail in [1   The FTIR system with the dot-product co-processor b uilds successfully meeting all timing constraints and pr oducing accurate results Table 7 This system has a lower  total execution time than the SW-only optimized FTIR buil d with SP math functions and Perflib Table 4\. However, the execution time is higher than on the FTIR system wi th the FPU co-processor FPU system speedup = 7.95x, Table 6 This is because the FPU optimizes all single-precis ion floating-point arithmetic whereas the dot-product c oprocessor only optimizes the dot-product calculatio n Nevertheless the core produces accurate results an d achieves a good speedup over the software FPU / Dot-product Compatibility and Integration With the dot-product core functionality verified, t he FPU is put back into the system Figure 14 This configur ation where the FPU is sharing the FCB with another coprocessor, has never been tested by Xilinx  Fig 14  FTIR system with dot-product and FPU coprocessors There are two issues with the FPU in Xilinx Platfor m Studio 9.1.02i that prevent it from working properly with another co-processor on the FCB The first issue deals with  instruction decoding Both the FCM load/store instr uction and the FPU load/store instruction share the same p rimary op-code 31 The only difference between the two instructions is in the first bit of the extended op code 9   


 10 While debugging with the ChipScope Logic Analyzer c ore it was found that the FPU attempted to decode ordin ary FCM load/store instructions This of course cause d a conflict on the FCB as the load/store core of the d ot-product co-processor also attempted to decode this instruct ion Xilinx quickly fixed this issue and delivered an up dated FPU core that properly ignored FCM load/store instructions 8  The second issue deals with the FCMAPULOADWAIT signal that is part of the FCB interface. This sign al is used to indicate to the APU controller that the FCM is not yet ready to receive the next load data The FPU constantly t oggles this line as part of its internal synchronization l ogic that lets it operate at half the clock rate of the FCB When other cores are present on the FCB toggling the FCMAPULOADWAIT signal interferes with their operation since the FCB is basically a wired-or bus. This was the case with the dot-product co-processor which would not load data correctly with the FPU toggling the FCMAPULOADWAIT signal. According to Xilinx, the FPU only needs to use the FCMAPULOADWAIT  signal under two conditions 1  The APU controller sends the two halves of a double precision load transfer back-to-back, and the FPU c an’t keep up 2  The APU controller flushes an outstanding operation  and then immediately provides load data to the FPU before it has had time to process the flush The first scenario does not apply to this design as  the FPU only supports single-precision floating-point opera tion The second scenario is, according to Xilinx, “unlikely although the probability of it happening depends on the code  being executed. Since the FPU implementation is hidden fr om the developer the only possible but not ideal soluti on to this issue is to disconnect the FCMAPULOADWAIT signal from the FPU Future releases of XPS will most likely fi x this issue at its source Table 8  Execution times for system with dot-product and FPU co-processors, SP math functions, and DP Perflib  SW Optimizations None base system SP Math IBM Perflib  HW Optimizations None base system APU-FPU \(100 MHz Dot-prod \(200 MHz  PPC405 Freq 200 MHz 200 MHz  Interferograms 1 1  Detectors 1 1  Software Component Time \(sec Time \(sec Speedup Re-sampling 1197.7938 149.3297 8.02x Spectrum \(Phase Correction, FFT 117.4963 14.3675 8.18x TOTAL 1315.2901 163.6972 8.03x     8 The updated FPU should be available in future rele ases of XPS The results in Table 8 show only a small improvemen t over the execution times observed with an FPU-only syste m no dot-product co-processor, Table 6\. One explanation for this is a higher than expected overhead in getting the d ata from memory to the dot-product co-processor To confirm this theory a number of similar systems were built and the performance of the dot-product core was compared to  the FPU when working with a smaller data set both from external DDR2 memory and on-chip block ram BRAM memory Perflib  was used in all tests to optimize software performance The CPU frequency was fixed to 200 MHz  The results are summarized in Table 9 below Table 9  Dot-product core testing with smaller data set Mem Type SW sec FPU sec Dot-prod sec Dot-prod Speedup BRAM 0.0065  0.00032 20.26x DDR2 0.0026  0.00042 6.13x BRAM  0.00070 0.00032 2.18x DDR2  0.00082 0.00042 1.94x  A few conclusions can be made from the data above First the dot-product core is about twice the speed of th e FPU when not starved for data.  It is clearly evident t hat working with a smaller more contiguous data set results in  better performance than working with larger less organize d chunks of data, as seen in the FTIR spectrometry al gorithm Additionally, both the FPU and the dot-product co-p rocessor achieve better execution times when the data set is  stored entirely in BRAM The results also indicate that th e performance of the dot-product co-processor is not significantly affected by the addition of the FPU t o the FCB in other words the two co-processors sharing the s ame bus are not slowing each other down Even though the do tproduct core is a valid co-processor, it only impro ves system performance under favorable memory access condition s which is not the case in the FTIR spectrometry algo rithm  Fig 15  Profiling results for system with dot-product and FPU co-processors, SP math functions, and DP Perflib  In the execution time profile Figure 15 the dotprod_ function is shown to consume less CPU time than bef ore With both the FPU and dot-product co-processor the  


 11 dotprod_ function consumes 2.95 of the CPU time compared to the previously observed value of 9.97 Figure 10 However this does not mean the function execu ted faster. In fact, as seen in the results in Table 8 the speedup is negligible compared to an FPU-only system Table  6 The value for dotprod_ function is lower because the profiler does not include helper functions that are  called within the dotprod_ function otherwise the function main would consume 100% of CPU time\. These helper funct ions could include various low level data copy and manip ulation operations. In fact, the profile now shows new func tions that take up significant CPU time that were not visible before for example memcpy  The cumulative contribution of the helper functions to the overall execution time is t he reason why little speedup is seen with the dot-product coprocessor even with the dotprod_ function itself taking up less CPU time 6  R ESULTS A NALYSIS  Table 10 presents the execution times of all system s described in this paper Without a doubt the two s oftware optimizations using single-precision math library and Perflib  and the inclusion of the APU-FPU core together provide impressive speedup across the board That i s because the aforementioned optimizations affect nea rly all portions of the FTIR software improving both singl eprecision SP math functions and APU-FPU as well a s double-precision arithmetic Perflib  The dot-product co-processor core, however, has alm ost no effect on the system performance. This is most like ly due to the noncontiguous pattern of memory access in the d otproduct computation of the FTIR spectrometry algori thm As was shown earlier, smaller more uniformly access ed data sets can achieve nearly 2x speedup over the FPU whe n using the dot-product co-processor Comparing the best performing FTIR system build on the ML410 development board to a V2P based NASA JPL implementation in 7  s h o w s  a n  o v e r a l l  s p e e d u p  o f  1 78x Table 11 The results of the best performing FTIR  build are first scaled to the appropriate number of inter ferograms and detectors to match what was used in the NASA JP L V2P research task.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

  16  Figure 15. AIRS-AMSRE differences as a function of AIRS error estimate over one day  AIRS has an error estimate of the total water vapor value that it calculates. The diffe rences between AIRS and AMSR-E are shown as a function of this estimate in figure 15 and very little correlation is found 11  R ELEVANT W ORK  Merged A-Train Level 2 Data A merged product that preserves the relationship of observed atmospheric water properties facilitates the hydrological studies by enabling scientists to get directly at the model data without worrying about the logistics of finding, collecting, and coordinating the measured quantities from different instruments. Previously there did not exist a capability to discover and access data from the A-Train\222s multiple instruments as merged multi-parameter data sets Enabling Orchestratable Service Workflows Our distributed service-oriented approach of loosely coupled services also enable s a higher level of reusability and orchestration with other services. Increasing numbers of workflow engines are already supporting Web Services as components/operators, which can then be orchestrated together into higher-level meta/virtual services SciFlo, a Scientific Dataflow Execution Environment, is a workflow engine that already supports assembling reusable SOAP Services, native execu tables, local command-line scripts, and codes into a distributed computing flow \(a graph of operators\8 SciFlo can u tilize o u r g en eric SOAP services as part of a larger coordinated data flow The Taverna Workbench is a free software tool for designing and executing workflows. Like SciFlo, it can orchestrate SOAP-based Web Services as components within a workflow. Taverna provides a visual editor to construct and edit the sequence of services in the workflow We have found that Taverna can dynamically introspect a given WSDL and construct the workflow component interface representing it Giovanni Giovanni, an acronym for the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Cent er, or GES DISC, Interactive Online Visualization and Analys is Infrastructure, is a webbased tool to help visualize Earth science data  It  provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze and access vast amounts of Eart h science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Similar to the services developed here, it addresses the difficulties of traditional data acquisition and analysis methods by moving the complexity to the server-side Giovanni provides multiple in terface instances based on instrument and measurement ty pes. For example, the \223ATrain Along CloudSat Track Inst ance\224 can provide plots of vertical profiles of clouds, temperature, humidity, cloud and aerosol classification across the multiple instruments of the A-Train A distinction between Givanni\222s A-Train data and the data set in this paper is that we are using a formal merged product of the A-Train. We leverage the NEWS effort that is based on error- and resolution-weighted mean of the input data sets, with associated uncertainty estimates. This provides a formal model of the collective A-Train observations rather than the collection of the individual instrument measurements Each of Giovanni\222s multiple interface instances provides a very simple and easy to use web interface. However, we recognized that sometimes scientists want more than the simple interfaces. Some scien tists may want to process Level 3 products using their own trusted code, or may want to perform variations of their own plots. With Giovanni, the individual scientist wanting more custom advanced capabilities must depend on the Giovanni development team Giovanni is based on the web portal paradigm where users visit a web page and use web tools to find and visualize data. Similar to Giovanni, our client APIs also make data acquisition more seamless. However, our services are based on the different paradigm were the power and flexibility of data analysis and processing are shifted back into the scientists own familiar computing environments. We realize that scientists generally want to perform \223exploratory computing\224 where they can sere ndipitously analyze the data using their own familiar and trusted code 


  17 Giovanni 2 was inherently synchronous where processing was bounded to a single http session. Long service running times still require the user to hold the same http session Similar to our asynchronous Web Service we discussed, the upcoming Giovanni 3 will be supporting asynchronous sessions. They will be using a RSS feed to monitor the service request. Version 3 will also be based on a servicesoriented architecture, wher e Giovanni services can be offered as a standard SOAP Web Services. This is similar to our approach, as well as SciFlo\222s services 12  C ONCLUSIONS  To achieve the science research goal of investigating longterm and global-scale trends in climate, water and energy cycle, and weather variability, we enhanced and improved on existing algorithms to work with distributed and heterogeneous data and information systems infrastructure By developing a service-oriented architecture for discovering, accessing, and mani pulating of NEWS merged A-Train data sets, we can strengthen the interconnectedness and reusability of these services across broader range of Earth science investigations The merged NEWS Level 2 data is a formal model containing the voluminous data from the AIRS, AMSR-E MLS, MODIS, and CloudSat instruments. Previously scientists wanting to perform long-term and global-scale studies encompassing simultaneous measured quantities would quickly face a data acce ss hurdle of first finding the data, then manually downloading them, and finally merging the data into a cohesive model\227before starting their analysis. Additionally the voluminous nature of the data particularly because of the MODIS data\each scientist potentially downloading the same data resulting in redundancy of reprocessing on the client sides. Our paradigm pushes more of the commonly repeated processing onto the server side. Moreover, this avoids repeated downloading of the same data among the science users. We can deliver customi zed averaged, subsetted, and summarized data of the merged A-Train observations to the scientists for them to immediately begin their analysis work We recognized that scientists also often want to perform 223exploratory computing\224 where they can freely explore the aspects of the data and run serendipitous exploration in their own familiar environment. We developed client-side distributed APIs in popular analysis environments such as Matlab, IDL, and Python. Our APIs hide the complexity of Web Services and allow the service capabilities to be embedded in the scientists own computing environments By purposely avoiding the \223web portal\224 paradigm and providing the suite of platform specific APIs in each of these language platforms, we enable the scientists to remain within their own familiar environments to select, process and download the data seamlessly into their environment for their own further analysis. Alternative methods involving web portals force the scientists to leave the environment and manually interact with the web portal to search and download the data We can examine not only long-term changes in amplitude of a single variable but also those among multiple variables Our L3Q clustering method was specifically designed to preserve information about the covariability of multiple observations, such as those from the A-Train.  Weather and climate variability is characterized by changes among atmospheric observables, but those changes have been limited by a lack of observations and analytical techniques We are not aware of any multi-parameter analyses to date The full potential of the A-Train climate record will not be realized until the multi-parameter climatology is understood. The work presented is one method of approaching this difficult problem Our service tool addresses several objectives of the NASA Earth science data community including 1\mprove interoperability to facilitate the transparent access and manipulation of heterogeneous and distributed data by science users, 2\ransition and deploy existing Earth science research analysis tools and software using a 223Service Oriented Architecture\224 \(SOA\ to enhance their reuse potential for other science domains and improve overall awareness and access of these tools by a broad community, 3\ increase users\222 ability to customize their discovery, access, deliv ery, manipulation, and preferred format of data and information 12  F UTURE W ORK  On-demand Level 3T Summaries from Level 3Q We plan to develop services for creating custom summaries of the L3Q data into more refined Level 3T summaries L3T\create their own custom Level 3 products on demand from L3Q. The custom Level 3 products are the transformation of L3Q data based on user-specific objectives such as regression and correlation analyses. The cust om production will generate not only the transformed data but also the statistical estimation of the accuracy of the summarized data based on the distribution of L3Q and the quality of L3Q Delegating the Temporal-Spatial Data Querying Currently, our processing layer utilizes existing and legacy processing code that was developed in IDL, Matlab, and C++. Though the original intent was to be able to adapt existing code and wrap as a service, this meant maintaining its original form of accessing the source data for processing Small modifications were made to enable these codes to quickly access the data based on file path and file naming schemes. However, we want to decouple the file accessibility and processing roles 


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
