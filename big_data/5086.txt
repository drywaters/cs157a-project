Saha Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Patna India Email sriparna@iitp.ac.in Abstract Determining different mentions of chemical names from texts has a wide-spread application in real life Chemical names are complex in nature and there exist several representations and nomenclatures like SMILES InChI IUPAC which create a big challenge to their automatic identiìcation and classiìcation In this paper we present a feature selection approach for appropriate feature subset selection from a wellknown supervised machine learning approach namely conditional random eld based classiìer CRF Several features are identiìed and extracted without using any domain speciìc knowledge and/or resources for determining mentions of IUPAC and IUPAClike names from scientiìc text using some supervised classiìcation technique The appropriate set of features for a particular supervised classiìcation technique is extracted from this huge collection of features using some single objective genetic algorithm based feature selection technique Experiments are carried out on the benchmark patent dataset Evaluation shows encouraging performance with the overall F-measure values of 70.01 by single objective optimization based approach on patent 2008 test data set Keywords  Mention Detection and Classiìcation from Biochemical Domain Feature Selection Genetic Algorithm Conditional Random Field I I NTRODUCTION In recent years information extraction is one of the hottest eld It has drawn huge attention to the practitioners and researchers There is a huge collection of online information which are unorganized In every day a large number of data documents are added to it So it is crucial to organize nd and extract relevant information from such a huge amount of data in our day-to-day life In particular in medical domain more than 2000 documents are added daily in the form of publications research papers patents journals etc and we cannot classify all those documents manually 1  Ddocument categorization ranking and retrieving entity-related information constitute some important steps in research and work life of general users and the researchers who can utilize these large number of textual documents like Medline 3 4  The de v e l opment of systems for automatic identiìcation of named entities relevant to a particular domain and their possible storage to different databases have helped many emerging application areas like information retrieval information extraction and information aggregation In order to automate these tasks some techniques have been devised since the last one decade especially for determining mentions of chemical names as well as to extract relations among them i.e proteinÖprotein interaction Chemical compounds like small si gnal molecules or other biological active chemical substances are the core entity classes in biological publications and patents Many representations and nomenclatures exist for chemical names Examples include SMILES InChI and IUPAC The rst two allow a direct structure search whereas IUPAC like names are most frequently occuring in biochemical texts Medline 3 4  l i k e huge text corpora databases can be beneìcial if we can classify and rank all those documents This will aid them in determining the entity related information in a fast and easy manner The documents can be classiìed and ranked if we can extract retrieve and gather the information which can be improved after identifying the entities of interest IUPAClike terms with high recall rate and map those entities to corresponding entries in the database Hence the process of identifying the entities of interest in the provided texts needs to be automated[5 Features of training and test data sets are very much important for good performance by some classiìcation techniques Feature selection 6 7  i s a lso h a v ing t he name of v ariable selection attribute selection or variable subset selection It is the technique used in machine leraning to automatically select the relevant subset of features for developing the classiìcation models Feature selection helps to improve the performance of a classiìer by selecting the appropriate sets of features Here the problem of appropriate feature selection is formulated as an optimization problem and thereafter a single objective based technique is developed for automatically determining the appropriate set of features from some supervised machine learning approaches For single objective optimization genetic algorithm 8 i s us ed as t h e underl yi ng opt i m i zat i o n t echni que Here we have used Conditional Random Field CRF 9 bas ed classiìer to nd mentions of IUPAC and IUPAC-like names from scientiìc texts GA is applied with CRF based classiìer to determine appropriate set of features from individual classiìers Finally GA results a set of solutions on the best population The solutions on the best populations are then combined using a GA based classiìer ensemble technique 10 The proposed systems are evaluated on the benchmark patent dataset Single objective bas ed approach attains the overall Fmeasure values of 70.01 for patent test data set of 2008 Comparative results show that the automatic feature selection technique is better than the systems with all features The two stage approach feature selection rst followed by classiìer ensembling is much effective than only the feature selection based approach 709 978-1-4673-6217-7/13/$31.00 c  2013 IEEE 


II P ROBLEM F ORMULATION In general feature and parameter selection problem is formulated under the single objective optimization It is stated as follows Given a set of features  and a classiìcation quality measure D  determine the feature subset F  such that D  F  max F   D  F  In case of named entity recognition from chemical domain the classiìcation quality measure is F-measure We have to select such feature combination for which corresponding Fmeasure value is optimized In general the search space for this type of problem is 2 d where d is the total number of possible features Thus exhaustive search strategies can not be applied in this case III P ROPOSED A PPROACH In this section we describe our proposed approach for chemical mention detection an d classiìcation in texts The task is formulated with respect to the machine learning perspective where the overall task focuses on entities such as IUPAC and MODIFIER mentions Chemical entities in general are named following different nomenclatures which are also combined by the authors of biomedical texts Rather than concentrating only on the correct IUPAC terms the deìnition is broadened by including any chemical substance mentioned in a IUPAClike manner Additionally it also includes IUPAC names in which a part is abbreviated fragmented and group names The proposed approach is based on a popular and robust machine learning technique namely Conditional Random Field CRF A Features for Chemical Name Identiìcation The success of any machine learning algorithm is based on the feature sets We identify and implement a very rich set of features that exploit morphol ogical lexical statistical and contextual information 5 Mos t of thes e features are automatically extracted from the training data without using any domain dependent resources and/or tools The below description of features is taken from 5  Context words  These are the words occurring within the context window w i 3 i  3  w i  3 w i 3  w i 2 i  2  w i  2 w i 2 and w i 1 i  1  w i  1 w i 1 where w i is the current word We include this feature because contextual tokens carry effective information for identiìcation of chemical names Word preìx and sufìx  These are the word preìx and sufìx character sequences of length up to n  The sequences are stripped from the leftmost preìx and rightmost sufìx positions of the words We set the feature values to undeìned if either the length of w i is less than or equal to n  1  w i is a punctuation symbol or if it contains any special symbol or digit We set the feature values to undeìned if either the length of w i is less than or equal to n  1  w i is a punctuation symbol or if it contains any special symbol or digit We experiment with n 3 i.e 6 features and 4 i.e 8 features both Word length  We deìne a binary-valued feature that res if the length of w i is greater than a pre-deìned threshold Here the threshold value is set to 5 This feature captures the fact that short words are likely not to be the chemical names Infrequent word  A list is compiled from the training data by considering the words that appear less frequently than a predetermined threshold i.e 10 in our current experiment Now a feature is deìned that res if w i occurs in the compiled list This is based on the observation that more frequently occurring words are rarely the chemical names Unknown token feature  This is a binary valued feature that checks whether the current token was seen or not in the training data In the training phase this feature is set randomly Word normalization  We deìne two different types of features for word normalization The rst type of feature attempts to reduce a word to its stem or root form This helps to handle the words containing plural forms verb inîections hyphen and alphanumeric letters The second type of feature indicates how a target word is orthographically constructed Word shapes refer to the mapping of each word to their equivalence classes Here each capitalized character of the word is replaced by A small characters are replaced by a and all consecutive digits are replaced by 0 For example IL is normalized to AA IL-2 is normalized to AA-0 and IL-88 is also normalized to AA-0 Word class feature  Certain kind of chemical names which belong to the same class are similar to each other The word class feature is deìned as follows For a given token capital letters small letters numbers and non-English characters are converted to A a O and  respectively Thereafter the consecutive same characters are squeezed into one character This feature will group similar names into the same chemical class Orthographic features  We deìne a number of orthographic features depending upon the contents of the wordforms Several binary features are deìned which use capitalization and digit information These features are initial capital all capital capital in inner initial capital then mix only digit digit with special character initial digit then alphabetic digit in inner The presence of some special characters like  etc is very much helpful to detect chemical names For example many biochemical names have  hyphen in their construction Some of these special characters are also important to detect boundaries of chemicals We also use the features that check the presence of ATGC sequence and stop words IV G ENETIC A PPROACH FOR A UTOMATIC F EATURE S ELECTION In this paper a single objective GA is now used for solving the feature selection problem for any classiìer A Chromosome Representation and Population Initialization If the total number of features is F  then the length of the chromosome is F  As an example the encoding of a particular chromosome is represented in Figure 1 Here F 12 i.e total 12 different features are available The chromosome represents the use of 7 features for constructing a classiìer rst third fourth seventh tenth e leventh and twelfth features The entries of each chromosome are randomly initialized to either 710 2013 International Conference on Advances in Computing Communications and Informatics ICACCI 


Fig 1 Chromosome representation for SOO based feature selection 0 or 1 Here if the i th position of a chromosome is 0 then it represents that i th feature does not participate in constructing the classiìer Else if it is 1 then the i th feature participates in constructing the classiìer If the population size is P then all the P number of chromosomes of this population are initialized in the above way B Fitness Computation We execute the following steps for tness computation 1 Suppose there are N number of features present in a particular chromosome i.e there are total N number of 1ês in that chromosome 2 Construct the classiìer with only these N features encoded in the chromosome 3 The training data is divided into 3 parts The classiìer is trained using 2/3 parts of the training data with the set of features encoded in the corresponding chromosome and evaluated with the remaining 1/3 part 4 The overall recall precision and F-measure values of this classiìer for the 1/3 training data are calculated 5 Steps 2-4 are repeated 3 times to perform 3-fold cross validation Then the overall average recall precision and F-measure values of the classiìer are determined from this cross validation test In case of SOO the objective function corresponding to a particular chromosome is f  F-measure avg  The objective is maximized using the search capability of genetic algorithm GA The objective is to maximize this objective function using the search capability of GA C Other Operators For single objective GA normal single point crossover 11 is used Here mutation operator is applied to each feature entry of the chromosome where the entry is randomly replaced by either 0 or 1 Roulette wheel selection is used to implement the proportional selection strategy D Combining the Solutions of the Final Population Both the approaches are executed for some maximum number of generations In case of SOO we obtain a set of solutions on the best population The nal solution is the one with the best F-measure value But some of the solutions on the best population are best with respect to recall values and some are best with respect to precision values Thus instead of selecting a single solution we have used a classiìer ensemble technique 10 t o combi ne t h e s ol ut i ons on t h e b es t popul at i on TABLE I S TATISTICS OF THE DATASETS Set abstracts sentences tokens IUPAC

Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC and forms a systematic way of naming organic chemical compounds that can be mapped to their structures T he below description of dataset is taken from 5 Chemical entities in general are named following different nomenclatures which are also combined by the authors of biomedical texts Rather than concentrating only on the correct IUPAC terms the deìnition is broadened by including any chemical substance mentioned in a IUPAC-like manner Additionally it also includes IUPAC names in which a part is abbreviated fragmented and group names We used the datasets available at 1  The training set was collected from the Medline abstracts The test data set is a collection of patent documents The test dataset was annotated with seven classes namely TRIVIAL single word terms like aspirin estragon testosterone Acetylsalicylate etc IUPAC multiword systematic names such as 1-hexoxy-4-methyl-hexane 1,4-dihydronaphthoquinones etc PART partial chemical names such as 8 methylthio  17betaetc MODIFIER ABBREVIATION abbreviations of names but not those that appear as part of IUPAC such as TPA AMPA etc SUM sum formulas like CH 3SNa KOH etc and FAMILY chemical families disaccaride pyrimidine hydrazides but not pharmacological/functional families:anti-inîammatory drug chelator etc However it is to be noted that training dataset has only the instances of IUPAC PART and MODIFIER classes The test dataset contains the instances of all the seven classes Statistics of the datasets are presented in Table I A Experimental Results Here a base

In this work   i.e the set of features contains the following i Various context word window within the previous three and next three words ii Preìxes of length up to three 3 features or four 4 features characters iii Sufìxes of length up to three 3 features or four 4 features characters iv Length of the word v Infrequent word vi Unknown token feature vii word normalization feature viii word class feature ix several orthographic features and x dynamic NE information Initially we construct following four baseline classiìers based on CRF frameworks using various random subsets of the above mentioned feature set Here C   i  j  denotes the context spanning from the previous i th word to the next j th word with the current token at position 0 Pre i and Suf i denote the preìxes and sufìxes of character sequences up to i of the current word respectively 1 Baseline 1  CRF classiìer trained using feature combinations C   3  3  Pre 4  Suf 4  and the features x descried in Section III-A 2 Baseline 2  CRF classiìer trained using feature combinations C   2  2  Pre 4  Suf 4  and the features x descried in Section III-A 3 Baseline 3  All the classiìers of the best population generated after application of the proposed technique on CRF based classiìer are combined using majority voting 4 Baseline 4  All the classiìers of the best population generated after application of the proposed technique on CRF based classiìer are combined using weighted voting Thereafter we apply our proposed SOO based feature selection techniques Section IV to solve the problem of NER from chemical domain for a different classiìer CRF In the rst step a CRF is trained using training data corpus from Medline and evaluation is done on an independent set of test data corpus The recall precision and F-measure values obtained by the proposed SOO based technique are also shown in Tables II for chemical test corpus prepared in 2008 After application of the proposed SOO based approach on an annotated chemical test corpus prepared in 2008 we were able to obtain a F1 measure of 67.69 recall  62.12 and precision  74.36 After application of the SOO based feature selection technique for CRF based classiìers we obtain a set of best solutions on the nal population Based on the features of these solutions we have generated a set of CRF based classiìers Some of them are good with respect to recall and some are good with respect to precision These solutions represent different feature combinations  By using these features we can again generate several CRF based classiìers These CRF based classiìers are combined using a newly developed SOO based classiìer ensemble technique 10 Ov eral l e v a l uat i o n results along with the baseline models are reported in Table II for chemical test corpus prepared in 2008 Evaluation of our proposed feature selection algorithm shows the stateof-the-art performance for a test corpus Final SOO based ensemble yields overall recall precision and F-measure values of 63.45 78.08 and 70.01 respectively for test corpus of 2008 Results show that SOO based feature selection is better than automatic feature selection techniques Table II shows that proposed approach is better than Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 for all the test data sets Results on all the test corpus also prove that the use of SOO based ensembling to combine the solutions on the nal population obtained after application of SOO based feature selection technique is more effective than the use of any other standard techniques like majority voting  Baseline 3 rweightedvoting Baseline 4  VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed a single objective based bio-chemical named entity recognition system The possible performance is highly dependent on the quality and representativeness of the features that were mostly identiìed without using any domain dependent resources In this work a classiìer conditional random eld CRF is used as the underlying classiìcation technique Then the problem of appropriate feature selection for any classiìer is posed as an optimization problem Thereafter a single objective based approach is developed for automatic feature selection from an underlying supervised classiìer namely conditional random eld CRF The proposed SOO based approach is based on genetic algorithm GA The proposed approach can determine the appropriate feature subsets which not only reduce the problem of overìtting but also optimizes the classiìcation quality We applied this technique for appropriate feature selection from a base classiìer namely CRF The proposed SOO based approach generates a set of solutions on the nal best population Solutions on the nal best population are combined using a SOO based classiìer ensemble technique The proposed systems are evaluated to solve the problem of NER from a chemical test corpus namely 2008 test corpus In future we would like to add some domain dependent features Future works include use of some other well known classiìers like decision tree and memory based learner R EFERENCES  R  K linger  C  K olarik J  F luck M H o fm an-A pitius  and C M.Friedrich Detection of IUPAC and IUPAC-like

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todayís cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlightís data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlightís hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlightís method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
