Abstract 
This paper describes web personalization the essence of personalization is the adaptability of information systems to the needs of the adaptability of information system to the needs of their users This issue is becoming increasing important on the web as non-expert users are overwhelmed by the quantity of information available online The proposed approach aims to mine a reduced set of effective association pattern 
rules for enhancing the online performance of web recommendations and proposed approach is evaluated based on the efficiency and quality Adaptive user clustering and profiling is essential to be able to accurately predict user actions In this paper we present results of our clustering and personalization project.We compare several distance measures used in clustering We introduce a new measure to assess the 
quality of clustering independent of the distance measure used in the clustering process We also compare different strategies\(such as clustering users vs clustering urls I INTRODUCTION Recently many researchers have investigated the generation of user profiles from raw web logs by using various data mining techniques The technique of clustering individual user sessions is seen as a method to aid in collaborative filtering in 4 5 6 Incremental web-log mining to create adaptive Web-servers have also been investigated Most of 
these approaches concentrate on either user or urI clustering but not on employing both Likewise they concentrate more on the clustering/profile creation methods themselves In this paper we look at employing both user as well as urI clustering information for better completeness and relevancy these attributes are defined below of the recommended set We investigate several distance measures commonly employed in the literature and evaluate some others We have also proposed a measure the induced entropy to assess the quality of clusters generated This quantity does not depend on the distance metrics invoked by the clustering algorithm it can be computed directly from the original data Experimental data is presented and discussed 
978-1-4244-4711-4/09/$25.00 2512009 IEEE II PROPOSED ApPROACH Clustering users seems to be an indirect approach In a sense it emphasizes the question what have like minded users done The primary emphasis should be on the question which urIs is this particular user likely to visit 
Then as a secondary option the user might be told what like minded people have done Amazon.com does this after a book purchase they inform the user which other books were deemed interesting by people who bought the same book Intuitively it appears that urIs should be clustered first and a list of the top few urI clusters closest to a user's usage pattern should be retrieved when the user signs on 
T 
Accordingly a comprehensive strategy would consist of the following steps 1 Cluster the URLs as well as the users note that clustering of URLs helps answer the question how similar are url's i andj 2 For each user maintain a list of the closest few urI clusters When the user logs-in first retrieve links from the urI clusters he/she is closet to 3 The last auxiliary step search the user clusters to find what other urIs like minded users have visited that might be missed by the urI clusters this particular user likes A Distance metrics As shown in Figure 1 we create an incidence matrix"\(denoted by A whose rows represent 
sessions and columns represent urIs If a urI was visited in a session the entry in that column is 1 otherwise it is 0 as illustrated in figure 1 Note that the 1 could be replaced by the count of number of times a urI was visited This gives more detailed information of visitation patterns In case users have explicitly ranked urIs giving them scores of some sort those scores can be entered instead of"I"s We approximate a session to be a user This is not necessarily true but with cookies this approximation can be close to reality a cookie lAMA 2009

only if only one entry is non-zero then 0 since xlg 0 as dominates On the other extreme if all entries are identical then is the total number of elements in the incidence matrix For any other distribution the is in between these two extremes It is seen that is biased by the dimensions of the matrix for example consider two different matrices with all entries identical one with dimensions values are different The reduced matrix generated by clustering can be shown to have less than the original matrix This is intuitive clustering is trying to reduce the spread by concentrating many incidence entries into one and is also reducing the dimensions Trying to minimize is therefore not a good way to assess the quality of clustering trivially group all sessions and all urIs into 1 cluster which will yield a 1 x 1 matrix whose 0 but this clustering is certainly not what is desired Instead we look at the The induced matrix has the exact same dimensions as the original matrix Suppose that columns urIs got collapsed into 1 column because of urI clustering and rows sessions got clustered together In the reduced matrix the x I block in the original matrix is replaced by a single element whose value o is the sum of all the elements in the original x I sub-block as explained above To generate the induced matrix this sum o is uniformly spread over a x sub-block Le each entry in the sub-block now has the value x sub-block III EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND CONCLUSION We tested the different distance metrics using the evaluation criteria described above Real web access logs from our departmental web-server were parsed to generate an incidence matrix of dimension 2474 sessions x 3013 urIs From this incidence matrix 10 different distance matrices were generated one set of 5 matrices for pair-wise distances among urIs corresponding to each of the 5 distance metrics described above The other set of 5 distance matrices was for pair-wise distances among sessions users The fuzzy C\255 medoids relational clustering method was then used to cluster the data This algorithm does not figure out the number of 18 clusters by itself that number must be provided as an input parameter to the algorithm For each value of number of clusters the algorithm was run 30 times The best clustering best decided based on the value of the objective function minimized by the algorithm from each batch was used to evaluate the scores mentioned in section 2.3 above The whole thing was run 42 times for each distance measure and the average scores with standard deviation in parentheses are tabulated in Tables I-II  The first column lists the number of sessions out of the original 2474 for which the intersection between the set of recommended urIs and the set of visited urIs was nonzero Le at leastone of the recommended urIs was visited This is the primary of aspect of the subjective scores we are concerned with For those sessions for which 0 the average relevance and completeness is listed in columns 2 and 3 the average was computed over the total number of sessions with non-zero intersection In the tables the 4th column titled 13.3582 Table 1 looking at the number intersected column that when the number of clusters is large Le,the distances between elements within a cluster are small the Euclidean norm distance metric leads to relatively better subjective scores.Table 3 compares different Hence there are no sessions to average the bad ecommendations over which is why the corresponding entry indicates not applicable Second strategy is to cluster on sessions reduced matrix dimensions 35x3013 The third row indicates the following strategy cluster on urIs first to obtain a reduced matrix 2474x900 and then cluster this matrix on sessions so that overall reduced matrix is 35x900 This clustering of sessions is in general different from the one obtained in in the second strategy The session-cluster\255 membership mapping generated by this two step process is then applied to the original matrix to generate an alternate session-clustered matrix of size 35x3013 and the subjective scores and entropy for this reduced matrix are indicated in the table The last two strategies yield overall reduced matrix of size 35x900 and test if the ordering of reduction steps matters The table demonstrates that clustering urIs leads to good completeness whereas clustering sessions leads to better relevance For the most part the induced entropy is better lower when the n   O The fact that the average is 1 or 2 indicates that a small number of useless urIs were recommended when there was no intersection between recommended and visited which is good The first 4 columns in the tables list the subjective scores strategies First strategy is to cluster on urIs alone reduced matrix dimensions 2474x900 In this case all sessions had non-zero of another matrix x v  want the user to at least visit that web-site  E to be maximum The recommendation service provider on the other hand would like to primarily worry about completeness they'd not be very happy if the user took none of their suggestions which would signal to them that the user did not like anything they recommended and may not pay for their service next time around they want to be maximum For this reason these scores are together referred to as subjective scores in the remainder of the manuscript We define the entropy E of the original matrix A to be In a sense 0 where and the other with dimensions even though they are both equally spread their by the reduced matrix the induced entropy is denoted by  In other words the single entry in the reduced matrix is replaced by a shows the average number of bad recommendations averaged over those sessions for which The last column lists the entropy of the induced matrix In each case row of the table the induced matrix has the same dimensions as the original incidence matrix Le 2474 x 3013 The entropy of the original incidence matrix was x m2,n2 19\(mn V R V n x x 


subjective scores are better We are further investigating the few cases where the scores go one way and the entropy goes the other way REFERENCES  G Eason B Noble and I N Sneddon On certain integrals of Lipschitz-Hankel type involving products of Bessel functions Phil Trans Roy Soc London vol A247 pp 529-551 April 1955 references  S Schechter M Krishnan and M D Smith Using path profiles to predict http requests in Proceedings of the 7th International World Wide Web Conference Brisbane Australia Proc Workshop on Web Information and Data Management 7th Inti Con on Information and Knowledge Management Eight International Fuzzy Systems Association World Congress Proceedings of the IEEE Knowledge and Data Engineering Exchange Workshop KDEX Communications of the ACM Proceedings of the WebKDD Workshop at the ACM SIGKKD Boston Proceedings of IJCAI Workshop on Intelligent Techniques for Web Personalization ITWP01 Seattle Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence IJCAI Seattle Workshop in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery SIGMOD IEEE Transcations on Fuzzy Systems Proceedings of SIGIR-94 17th ACM International Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval April 1998  A Joshi C Punyapu and P Karnam Personalization and asynchronicity to support mobile web access in November 1998  O Nasraoui H Frigui A Joshi and R Krishnapuram Mining web access logs using relational competitive fuzzy clustering August 1999  B Mobasher R Cooley and J Srivastava Creating Adaptive Web Sites Through Usage-Based Clustering ofURLs in 1999 6 Mobasher Cooley and J Srivastava Automatic Personalization Based On Web Usage Mining vol 43 no 8 pp 142-151 Aug 2000  B Mobasher H Dai T Luo M Nakagawa Y Sun and J Wiltshire,"Discovery of aggregate usage profiles for Web personalization in Aug 2000  B Mobasher H Dai T Luo and M Nakagawa Improving the Effectiveness of Collaborative Filtering on Anonymous Web  Data in  P Domingos C Anderson and D Weld Adaptive Web Navigation for Wireless Devices in 2001,pp 879-884  T Kamdar and A Joshi On creating adaptive web servers using weblog mining Tech Rep CS-TR-00-05,CS Department  UMBC 2000.[10 A Joshi and R Krishnapuram Robust fuzzy clustering methods to support web mining in 1998 vol 15 pp 1-8  A Joshi K Joshi and R Krishnapuram On mining web access logs Tech Rep CS Department UMBC 1999  R.Krishnapuram A.Joshi O.Nasraoui and Liyu Vi Low complexiy fuzzy relational clustering algorithms for web mining in 2001  David D Lewis andWilliam A Gale A sequential algorithm for training text classifiers in W Bruce Croft and Cornelis J van Rijsbergen Eds Dublin IE 1994 pp 3-12 Springer Verlag Heidelberg DE 2001 11
