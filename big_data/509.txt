Anonymous Communication in MANET s, Solutions and Challenges   Avissa Hosseini Tehrani, Hamid Shahnasser  ECE Department, San Franci sco State University, CA E-mail:  tehrani@sfsu.edu   Introduction  A mobile ad hoc network \(MANET\gned for small groups of peop le with same special interests who want to communicate through their available devices like laptops or cell phones to 
share their ideas easily, quickly, and with minim um requirements. However providing a secure communication platform for this kind of network is a challenge because of the shared wireless medium. In MANET there is no fixed infrastructur e like routers in wired network or an access point in managed wireless ne twork to relay packets between nodes. Instead, each node participates in routing by forwarding data 
for other nodes. MANET has become popular in several application areas  including  when a group of soldiers in enemy territory need to communicate through their available devices to re ceive a command or report their situations. The content of messages can be secured with cr yptography, but vital information like nodes identities and their locations can be revealed by traffic analysis. Emergency operations like 
search and rescue, commando operations, security scenarios, and collaborative research group are other examples of applications using MANET. In most of these applications security is very important however each of them needs a different level of security  Attacks on MANETs can be divided into two cate gories, passive and active attacks. An active attack alters the operation of networks by modifying and interrupting data. A passive attack does 
not disturb the operation of networks. Traffic Anal ysis is one of the most invisible and unsolved passive security attacks against MANETs. In tr affic analysis an adversary overhears network traffic in order to infer sensitive information about the applications and participators in a communication, like nodes identity, location, a nd the relationships of communicating nodes The passive adversary can be an external observer  or an insider node in the path. Passive adversaries attempt to be invisible, until they locate their targets and then physically destroy 
them. The anonymous communication protocol is designed to protect MANET against traffic analysis. The main principles of an ideal anonymous protocol are    Protecting sender, receiver and their relationship  the  real identities of the sender, receiver and intermediate nodes are secure and adversaries cannot determin e who is talking to whom   Intractability 
 adversaries cannot trace a message to its sender or receiver   Secure authentication  each pair of nodes can authenticat e each other without knowing their real identities   High efficiency  the computational overhead of crypto graphic operations should be low  This paper reviews and evaluate s some outstanding protocols offering anonymity for MANETs 
It takes a closer look at the meaning of a nonymity and the necessity of using anonymous communication to protect mobile ad hoc networks then it explains the pros and cons of each current solution and the short comings and challeng es that are not addressed by these protocols

Current Solutions  Five protocols are reviewed in this section and all follow three phases: first is the Path Discovery phase in which a Route Request message \(RREQ\ed by the source to find a path through intermediate nodes to destination. Second Phase is the Path Reverse phase in which destination sends a Route Reply message \(RREP\ back to source through the nodes in the path The last phase is the Data Transfer phase in which the source sends data to destination through the path  I.   One of the early anonymous protocols offe red for wireless network was Secure Distributed Anonymous Routing Protocol \(S DAR\[3 defined a prot ocol like Onion [9 in wired network. In the path discovery phase a fixed si ze RREQ message, created by the source, passes through intermediate nodes when their real ident ities are added to the me ssage. In path reverse phase, a RREP message constructed by the destination from all intermediate real ids is sent toward source. When the source gets the reverse message, it uses the intermediate session keys to encrypt the data and transfer it to destination in data transfer phase. In this protocol, real identities of sender and receiver are secured ag ainst an outside viewer, because they are encrypted in the route reply \(RREP\ message, but the receiver recognizes the sender and all the intermediate nodes identities. If the receiver is compromised, all information about the other nodes is revealed. Padding keeps the size of the message constant whenever it is broadcasted by an intermediate node and that makes it difficult for adversar ies to follow the message, but padding requires extra work. The excess computing required in every node for encryption/decryption makes this protocol ineffi cient. All nodes may need to have a connection to a CA \(Certificate Authority\ or other such re sources to learn about other nodes public key and verify their signatures  II. MASK is another anonymous routing prot ocol in MANETs. RREQ and RREP have a fixed size and fixed number of fields and routing info rmation doesnt add to RREQ \(there is no layered Onion structure and padding\donym instead of real identifiers in the routing process. For authentication, MASK uses pairing concept to implement anonymous authentication 2 udonym when it goes from one node to another Also the source and the destination can authen ticate each other based on the pseudonym they receive and defined hash functions All nodes have to broadcast th e message be it the destination node when it receives the RREQ or the source when it receives the RREP.  Authentication defined in this protocol is more secure a nd has less overhead than the other methods. This protocol is also resistant to several attacks like message coding atta ck, flow recognition and message reply attack, and timing analysis attack. The RREP type is encrypted in the message so adversaries cannot trace a RREP message to its source. Attacker cannot track RREQ and RREP in the way to destination and to the source because these messages are forwarded by destination and source as well. Too much key synchronizati on is needed between nodes in this protocol This protocol needs a trusted center to create ps eudonyms for different nodes. Destination id is included in RREQ message without any encryption, and it is a pseudonym, but this pseudonym id does not change when a message is broadcas ted through intermediate nodes and can reveal some information. There is less encryption and decryption in this method but creating and keeping different pseudonyms in tables in each node creates another overhead  


III. The other famous protocol is Anonymous Routing Protocol for MANET \(ARM\4  An  important aspect of this protocol is that a powerful passive adversary can trace the RREP message from the destination back to the source This is because only the intermediate nodes that are assumed to forward the RREP actually do so and all the other nodes drop the RREP packet 4  ARM uses p s eudon y m instead of real identit y o f source and d e stination. W h en the  destination receives RREQ, it broadcasts the message as well to confuse the adversaries. On the way back to the source, when a node receives an RREP, it broadcasts the message even if it is not in the path. This protocol uses probabilistic time to leave \(ttl\ and padding, so it is not clear what nodes pass RREP to the source. There is less encryption in this protocol, but still every node has to do some extra computation, e.g., tryi ng to decrypt the tra pdoor or making random value for dummy messages. An adversary will be able to learn which node is the source of a fresh message, but it cannot track messages to ot her nodes in the path. The use of pseudonym needs coordination and synchronization between source and destination and other nodes. There are too many dummy messages forwarde d between nodes in this protocol  IV. Anonymous Secure Routing in MANETs \(A SR\ues that anonymity and security issues have to be seen together and not separately [7  This method is similar to the Mask protocol in that the RREQ and RREP have constant size but in ASR destination identity is encrypted in RREQ. ASR uses a different equation to compute pseudonym for intermediate nodes. ASR is also similar to MA SK in that it does not add routing information to the RREQ. ASR encrypts destination identific ation in RREQ, but each intermediate node has to do a decryption to access the destination and s ee if it is the last node in the path. In this protocol, there is the same data that is trav eling between nodes like seq \(the sequence number of the current session\it is not encrypted  V.   ANODR is the last protocol discussed here 6  The featu r e that did n o t mentioned in other protocols is the route maintenance phase: the ro uting table entries in intermediate nodes are recycled upon a definite timeout RREP messages carry no identifier that can be linked to the RREQ messages. This means that for a node to d ecide whether it has to forward a RREP or not it has to try to decrypt it with every private key it has stored in its routing table  Review and Challenges  Two scenarios of change in a communication help adversaries to eavesdrop information. One is change in traffic pattern. When a node \(source sends a message with RREQ type, the adversary can guess this node is the sender. When an intermediate node receiv es a RREQ message, and after a period of time forwards a RREQ message, th e adversary can guess this node is in the path When a node receives a RREQ message and stops forwarding RREQ, the adversary can guess this node is the destination. On the way back to the source, when a node receives the RREP message, it forwards the me ssage if this node is in the path otherwise drops it. The adversary can trace the RREP message and find out which nodes are in the path. The solution defined by MASK and ARM is that all nodes forward the message, including the destination when it receives RREQ, source when it receives RREP and all intermediate nodes when they receive RREP even if they are not in the path so that the adversary cannot figure out the exact place the message stopped. Two ways are offered to keep th e size of the message constant. One way is 


padding that adds too much overhead and the othe r way is keeping routing information in the nodes, not in the messages. The second me thod is more efficient and more secure  The other scenario is the routing information carried in a message. If RREQ or RREP messages carry source, destination and in termediate nodes identifications an adversary can read this information.  One solution is to encrypt routing information and add it to the message, but that needs too much encryption and decryption and uses padding to fix the size of message which is not efficient. The other solution is using pseudonyms instead of real identities and keeping routing information in nodes. In this way the size of message doesnt change, it needs less decryption and is more secure. But still there are some fields in RREQ message that can reveal some information to adversar ies like message type and mess age ID. Some methods suggest encrypting these two fields as well, but this cr eates more overhead. It means each node has to decrypt part of message to see if this message is for this node or not. Hence it is not efficient and can present an opportunity for adversarie s to run duplicate message attack  In conclusion, in the routing process, using pseu donyms instead of real identities helps to hide real identities. Pseudonyms have to be changed dy namically since traffic analysis uses the same mechanism to analyze real identifiers and pseu donyms. In addition, critical data that reveals information to attacker has to be encrypted Having too much encryption/decryption is not efficient and creates a big overhead for the nodes th at have restricted computing power. To avoid information deduction we need to keep the message size unchanged. Conse quently it is better not to add routing information to RREQ message otherwise we have to pad messages to make them the same size, adding  extra overheads. The last word is how to break up an anonymous communication. Since the purpose is security and privacy not ambiguous communication everyone should not be capable of setting up an anonymous MANET   References 1  C. Siva Ram Murthy, B. S. Manoj.

Parameter Isolation \(Test Data Evaluation 3. CASE STUDY The fault detection and faulty parameter isolation methodology was applied to computers. Experiments were conducted on ten brand new identical computers with the assumption that these computers were representative of healthy systems. The data from the healthy computers were used to define a healthy baseline and to study the parameters  behaviors. The performance parameters monitored during the experiments were fan speed, CPU temperature, motherboard temperature, video card temperature, two power saving states \(%C2, and %C3 CPU usage, and %CPU throttle. These parameters are represented as P1 to P8 in the following discussion The experiment was designed to replicate the real-time usage of computers. The computers were exposed to six environmental conditions, as shown in Table 1. For each temperature-humidity combination, four usage conditions and three power supply conditions were considered. A set of user activities was defined to execute different usage conditions on the computers. Details on experimental setup and training data collection can be found in the authors   previous publications [15], [16]. In total, 72 experiments were conducted. The same usage conditions were applied simultaneously to all computers to achieve time synchronization between computer and software application responses. The computer  s power mode was always set to ON. The screen saver and hibernation options were disabled to prevent these functions from occurring during the experiment Table 1.

The threshold was used to compare the MD values of test systems to determine the health state or presence of faults. Once the presence of a fault was established, the next objective was to isolate the parameter that was responsible for the fault in the computer For this study, eight parameters were monitored with  one change at a time  and nine analytical experiments were defined as listed in Table 2. Each cell entry in Table 2 represents a parameter  s status in the MD calculation  1   means that a parameter was included, and  2  means that a parameter was excluded from the MD calculation For each experiment \(Table 2 from the training data. The differences in S/N ratios with the inclusion and exclusion of each parameter in MD 5 calculation are presented in Figure 4. The parameters that have downward slopes \(i.e., a loss of information due to a parameter  s absence degree of slope defines the significance level of a parameter  s importance in MD calculation. Figure 4 suggests that at least four out of eight parameters must be considered for MD calculation, including fan speed, CPU temperature, motherboard temperature, and video card temperature Table 2.

Figure 7. Comparison of MDs of test system with baseline CPU performance-related parameters in the MD analysis fell beyond the threshold bound almost entire test time \(i.e 56% below lower bound and 42% above upper bound did not had the highest  MD  which suggested that there might be a problem with the CPU and should be analyzed further. The correlation coefficient analysis showed that the CPU performance parameters were not strongly correlated with the fan or temperature parameters. Whereas, a strong positive correlation \(correlation coefficient &gt; 0.75 the fan and temperature parameters was observed. The S/N ratio estimation suggested that the parameters related to CPU performance were of least importance in MD calculation. These two analyses suggested that CPU performance parameters were not causing the faults and thus were not considered as faulty. The results presented in Table 4 indicate that fan speed was the most likely faulty parameter because the fan parameter had highest PFP, and the fan speed was correlated with the temperature parameters At the 2,700th data point \(Figure 7 observed because the computer shutdown by itself and was then restarted manually. This resulted in temporary fan start-up and a drop in three temperatures. However, these temperatures were above the nominal/expected value of the CPU and video card temperatures during that period Therefore, these temperatures were identified as anomalous as well. Intuitively, if the fan were not functioning well, the temperature of the system would rise and become abnormally high. Manual investigation of the data set also indicated that the fan was not functioning well and that the three monitored temperatures were higher than the nominal temperature values by ~10  C. Therefore, it can be affirmed that this new approach did identify the faulty parameter of the computer Table 4.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A new fault isolation approach that utilizes the Mahalanobis distance has been demonstrated. The work expands the 7 applicability of the Mahalanobis distance from detection to fault isolation. In the literature, unhealthy system data has been used to scale MD values for fault isolation. In the new approach presented in this paper, data from an unhealthy system is not required; rather, a threshold bound based on healthy training data for each parameter is defined considering design of analysis \(DoA strength of the MD method is that it preserves all the information available because it does not reduce the dimensionality of the data A set of experiments was conducted to establish the  healthy  or  normal  operation on a set of notebook computers subjected to a range of usages and environmental conditions. A field-returned computer was evaluated in situ using Mahalanobis distance techniques. The Mahalanobisdistance-based faulty parameter identification method was used to identify the fault and the related key parameters for 


used to identify the fault and the related key parameters for root cause analysis of the anomalies. Four important parameters  fan speed and three temperature components CPU temperature, motherboard temperature and video card temperature  were identified for health estimation using the MD method. In the analysis of a field-returned computer using the suggested fault isolation approach, the fan speed parameter was identified as being faulty and verfied later The results showed that the suggested approach could be used for quick fault detection at a system level, and the same distance measure can also be used for faulty parameter isolation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is sponsored by the members of the CALCE Prognostics and Health Management Consortium at the University of Maryland, College Park REFERENCES 1] M.

well as from practitioners, is available, IL strategy including DWH/BI strategy IL strategies are addressed at all, either actual artifacts/documents are proposed without an integrating meta model/methodology, or the strategy making process is described without proposing specific and consistent result templates/structures Since it consumes a significant amount of resources and may constitute significant potentials for business, IL needs strategy. IL strategy must not be limited to hardware/software selection and architectural considerations, but should address the entire business scope of sourcing services, integrating acquired and self-made services into customer-oriented IL solutions, and delivering such solutions to create customer value Our survey of the state of IL strategy in practice reveals that IL sourcing, IL delivery and IL portfolio strategies are regarded as important strategy components. The larger companies are, the more international their focus is, and the more their IL is organized according to the CC model, the more components of a supply-chain oriented explicit IL strategy they are likely to have deployed The IIM model provides a suitable conceptual foundation for structuring such strategy components and also provides best practices from IT management which often can be easily adapted to IL. Regarding IL product/service development and maintenance certain functional oriented strategy sub-components are differentiated in our framework. These strategy components are adapted from an established data management functional framework in order to reflect IL specifics. While traditional, more technically oriented sub-components such as system and data architecture are covered in most companies, business oriented components like change management and project/business requirements management are covered less frequently. Additional research is necessary to develop appropriate solution components based on existing fragments and experiences Based on a more complete comprehension of IL strategy and its components, the strategy development and update process needs to be addressed in future research as well. Instead of developing and updating business strategies, IT strategies and IL strategies in independent processes, dependencies and cycles need to be addressed. A comprehensive understanding of IL strategy and respective processes may also serve as a foundation for establishing maturity models, reference models and best practices  References 1] Arnott, D. and G.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
