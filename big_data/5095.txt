variety of sensors and become computationally powerful which allows for real-time fusion and processing of data gathered by them However most of existing frameworks for context-aware systems are usually dedicated to static centralized architectures and those that were designed for mobile devices focus mainly on limited resources in terms of CPU and memory which in nowadays world is no longer a big issue Mobile platforms require from the context modelling language and inference engine to be simple and lightweight but on the other hand  to be powerful enough to allow not only solving simple context identication tasks but also more complex reasoning These with combination of a large number of sensors and CPU power available on mobile devices result in high energy consumption of a system The original contribution of this paper is a proposal of an intelligent middleware for mobile context-aware frameworks that is able to learn sensor usage habits and minimize energy consumption of the system I I NTRODUCTION R ESEARCH in the area of pervasive computing and ambient intelligence aims to make use of context information to allow devices or applications behave in a contextaware thus intelligent way Dey denes conte xt as any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity  The information in Dey's denition may be 1 location of the user spatial context 2 presence or absence of other devices and users nearby or collaboration with other users social context 3 time temporal context 4 user behavior or activity  and possibly 5 any other environmental data gathered by microphones light sensors etc The variety of sensors available on nowadays mobile devices allow for complex contex-based reasoning but at the same time requires a lot of resources and energy Although there are many frameworks and middlewares developed for context-aware systems 3 4 the y do not provide full support for all of the challenges that we believe are crucial for mobile computing e.g smartphones or tablets with respect to the context modelling and contextbased reasoning Those are Energy efciency  most of the sensors when turned on all the time decrease the mobile device battery level very fast This reects on usability of the system and ecological aspects regarding energy saving Data privacy  most of the users do not want to send information about their location activities and other private data to external servers Hence the context reasoning should be performed by the mobile device itself Resource limitations  although mobile phones and tablets are becoming computationally powerful the context aware system has to consume as low CPU and memory resources as possible in order to be transparent to the user and other applications System responsiveness  in mobile environment context changes very fast Hence no delays are admissible in processing contextual data Context data distribution  in mobile pervasive environments many devices produces huge amount of contextual information hence the quality measures should be developed and distribution methods designed to t characteristics of such unstable and dynamic network All of these require from the modelling language and inference engine to be simple and lightweight On the other hand the model should be powerful enough to allow not only solving simple context identication tasks but also more advanced context processing and reasoning This gives motivation for developing a solution that will allow for using advanced reasoning and modelling techniques with as low energy cost as possible The original contribution of the paper is a proposal of an intelligent middleware for mobile context aware frameworks that is able to learn sensor usage habits and minimize energy consumption of the system The rest of the article is organized as follows In Section II an existing context aware systems and frameworks are presented and the motivation of the paper is given The architecture that can be used in combination with our approach is presented in Section III The Section IV discusses the learning algorithm used for intelligent middleware and Section V presents an evaluation of the algorithm Finally summary and directions for future work are given in Section VI II S TATE OF THE ART AND MOTIVATION In recent years a lot of development was devoted to build applications that use mobile devices to monitor and analyse various user contexts The availability of application distribution platforms for common mobile operating systems e.g Google Play for Android stimulated the popularity and adoption of such solutions However most of them focus only on a very narrow application area of context awareness Most of them are end user applications and not more generic Proceedings

frameworks Some selected representative cases are briey described below A Context aware systems The SocialCircuits platform uses mobile phones to measure social ties between individuals and uses longand short-term surveys to measure the shifts in individual habits opinions health and friendships inuenced by these ties Jung focused on disco v ering social relationships e.g family friends colleagues and so on between people He proposed an interactive approach to build meaningful social networks by interacting with human experts and applied the proposed system to discover the social networks between mobile users by collecting a dataset from about two millions of users Given a certain social relation e.g isFatherOf the system can evaluate a set of conditions which are represented as propositional axioms asserted from the human experts and show them a social network resulted from data mining tools Sociometric badge has been designed to identify human activity patterns analyse conversational prosody features and wirelessly communicate with radio base-stations and mobile phones Sensor data from the badges has been used in various organizational contexts to automatically predict employee's self-assessment of job satisfaction and quality of interactions Eagle and Pentland used mobile phone Bluetooth transceivers phone communication logs and cellular tower identiers to identify the social network structure recognize social patterns in daily user activity infer relationships identify socially signicant locations and model organizational rhythms Beside research projects there exist also a variety of application that are used for gathering information about context from mobile devices like SDCF A W ARE 1  JCAF SCOUT 12 Conte xtDriod 13 Gimbal 2  These are mostly concerned with low-level context data acquisition from sensors suitable for further context identication On the other hand they do not provide support nor methodology for creating complex and fully customizable context-aware systems and do not provide any mechanisms for limiting energy consumption of the system What is more all of the approaches described above use their own dedicated methods for gathering and maintaining context These methods are mostly not applicable for reuse or their functionality is limited to simple context matching Some of the systems do not provide any support for context modelling nor context reasoning limiting their functionality only to identifying and collecting contextual information B Context aware frameworks To solve the issue of reusability of the system a lot of frameworks were designed These frameworks are based on many different architecture paradigms which pros and cons in terms of energy efciency responsiveness and privacy were presented in this Section 1 http://www.awareframework.com 2 https://www.gimbal.com The system described in uses direct sensor access architecture which is usually not very energy efcient however it preserver privacy issues since no communication with external servers is usually needed and the interpretation of the sensor data as well as reasoning is performed directly on the host device The CoBrA system w as b uild on centralized context server architecture This approach is especially useful when a context-aware system is composed of many mobile devices with limited resources The server relieves mobile agents from performing reasoning tasks On the other hand one has to consider privacy issues connected with sending private contextual data to remote server quality of service issues etc This approach is also characterized with rather low responsiveness that stems from a possible lack of network connection or communication delays Service oriented architecture with combination of distributed architecture was used in SOCAM system In context-aware applications this architecture is used mainly in pervasive environment where variety of context information from many different sources has to be processed This architecture usually does not preserves privacy nor energy efciency issues since usually it assumes communication over the web between each of its elements Although SOCAM provides architecture for distributed mobile systems it mostly solves problems of a low memory and CPU power of mobile agents which nowadays is no longer a big issue for most of the mobile devices like smart-phones or tablets On the other hand energy efciency issue is still a big problem which was not addressed by none of the solutions described in this Section This gives motivation for developing an architecture that will allow for advanced context-based reasoning and modelling but at the same time allow for minimizing energy usage costs of sensors that are needed in such reasoning An overview of the proposed system is presented in following Section III I NTELLIGENT MIDDLEWARE APPROACH The proposed solution incorporates an idea of a mobile device as an autonomous context-aware entity equipped with intelligent middleware layer and context-based inference layer The intelligent middleware act as a proxy between context sources and inference layer It is able to learn sensor usage patterns and thus adjusting sampling rates to signicantly improve energy consumption of the system See Section IV The architecture of a system that may use intelligent middleware approach should consist of three main elements 1 sensors layer  responsible for gathering data from sensors and performing initial preprocessing of them 2 inference layer  responsible for context based reasoning and knowledge management and 3 intelligent middleware layer  acting as an intelligent proxy between sensors layer and the inference layer The Sensor Layer gathers data directly from mobile device sensors Due to the different possible sensor types GPS Accelerometer Bluetooth different methods for interpreting 994 PROCEEDINGS OF THE FEDCSIS KRAK  OW 2013 


  n r     r       n n\n  Figure 1 Architecture of the mobile context aware framework these data are required Hence each sensor has its own interpreter module that is responsible for initial preprocessing of the raw data Data preprocessing is triggered by the intelligent middleware The Inference Layer is responsible for performing reasoning based on the model knowledge base and the working memory elements facts The inference engine may be a rule engine rst-order logic reasoner probabilistic inference module or any other custom approach However we argue that to allow more complex reasoning tasks than just simple context classication the best choice is lightweight rule engine The Intelligent Middleware is responsible for exchanging information between sensors layer and inference layer The working memory is shared between all models stored within the inference layer acting as a knowledge cache  Therefore it minimizes the number of required requests to the sensors layer improving power efciency of the entire system The idea of separating Intelligent Middleware from inference layer is that it is able to learn sensors usage habits and in consequence adapt itself to the individual device characteristics It automatically generates a model of usage habits from historical data and based on that model data it adjusts the sampling rates for the sensors appropriately It improves power efciency of the system since sampling rates are not xed but leaned from the usage patterns On the other hand it may help in increasing responsiveness of the system since the learned model allows predicting not only future sensor activity but also context-aware application needs Hence it is possible to get the desired context in advance before the application actually requests it It can be especially useful in cases when context cannot be obtained by the middleware directly from the sensor layer but has to be for example downloaded over the internet However in this paper we focus only on the power efciency advantage of the usage of the intelligent middleware approach The following sections describes in details the learning algorithm used and provide an evaluation on a simple use case scenario IV L EARNING ALGORITHM Input data The algorithm takes as an input a vector of m percepts Each percept is described by a pair  X i  Y i  interpreted respectively as time of percept and sensor activity state Such a notation results in two vectors X Y of size m such that 8 i<m 0  X i  24   Y i   1 _ Y i  1  Time equals numbers of hours passed since last midnight and percept is Y i  f  1 f or inactive state 1 f or active state Learning objective Sensor activity depends largely on its stochastic and inaccessible environment Being so it is impossible to predict it with absolute certainty however often some part of its variance can be explained by time of a day The algorithm proposed aims to exploit that possibility by nding a function determining probability of sensor usage given time of a day F  t   P  X  1 j t   Problems of learning conditional probability are often addressed in Machine Learning by using logistic regression The following paragraphs dene necessary concepts and present the problem in terms of logistic regression with accordingly chosen parameters Hypotheses set Finding objective function F  t  is achieved by searching a hypotheses set H  Each function h in hypotheses set has to have the following properties 1 be continuous 2 be dened in range  0 24   3 h 0  h 24  4 return values in range  0 1  probability To perform search it is necessary to represent each function in H in a general form parametrized by some vector w of length 2 n  1  such that every combination of parameters in w will yield in a proper hypothesis h  H w  Such representation allows to transition from searching a set of functions to searching a linear space R 2 n 1  A representation that has the rst three of required properties is given below S   t    0  n  1 X i 0   2 i 1 cos  i  t  12    n  1 X i 0   2 i 2 sin  i  t  12   It may be understood as a sum of some rst terms of Trigonometric Fourier Series parametrized by vector   Using only low frequency components is desirable because they are SZYMON BOBEK KRZYSZTOF PORZYCKI GRZEGORZ J NALEPA LEARNING SENSORS USAGE PATTERNS 995

Evaluation on a real device showed that we can gain up to 50 of energy saving using this algorithm As a future work the implementation of the algorithm for an Android device is planned to allow real-time online learning and full evaluation of the intelligent middleware approach not only for a GPS but also other sensor like accelerometer gyroscope etc It is also planned to implement the learning algorithm that uses Markov chains and compare it to existing implementation We plan to design and develop an architecture dedicated for mobile context aware applications equipped with an intelligent middleware layer and rule based inference layer provided by the HeaRT inference engine which is a lightweight rule-based engine that uses XTT2 notation for knowledge representation This will allow for lightweight reasoning and also v erication of conte xt models 21 We plan to incorporate and evalueate the middleware in the context-aware system for monitoring threats in urban environment proposed in W e also belie v e that it w ould be valuable to compare challenges and problems in mobile context-aware computing with an area connected with research about wireless sensor

 Leonardi Cluster Torque 5.4.0 Python 2.4.3 Leonardi is a medium-sized high performance Computing cluster It currently consists of 2,944 AMD Opteron 6174 2.20GHz processor cores with a total of 5.8TB of physical memory essentially 2GB of memory per core and 100TB of usable disk storage Leonardi runs the Rocks clustering platform on top of CentOS Linux The maximum of 192 processor cores are used exclusively for our experiments Restricted by the platform of Torque in the Leonardi cluster we do not use Hadoop to manage the mapper and reducer jobs Instead we develop a simple module to nish splitting sorting and merging work to simulate the mapreduce computing model on this platform Since most of the time cost of A D 1 are generated by its mapper jobs the implementation of our module will not affect the measurement of the experiments We also believe that these experiments can be easily replicated using Hadoop A Performance trend of algorithm A D 1 In Figure 10\(a X-axis is set to user number from 2000 to 10000 and Y-axis is set to time cost The input BiUCB matrices are all random sparse matrices with 50 contexts 3 behaviors and the same density minu 8 and minc 3 are applied to control the total time cost In Figure 10\(b X-axis is set to context number from 50 to 100 and Y-axis is set to time cost The input BiUCB matrices are all random sparse matrices with 1000 users 3 behaviors and the same density minu 3 and minc 2 are applied to control the total time cost In both of them CPU core number is 48 The time cost of A D 1 increases according with increasing of context and user numbers We also simulate a polynomial trend for them These lines could approximately act as a O n 3  incremental trend B Time Cost Reduction with minu and minc In all the following experiments the input BiUCB matrix is a random sparse one with 50000 users 30 contexts and 3 behaviors the average number of cb pairs for each user is 9 In Figure 11 the number of CPU cores is 48 In Figure 11\(a X-axis is set to the minu from 4 to 32 and Y-axis is set to the time cost minc 5 is also applied to control the total time cost In Figure 11\(b X-axis is set to the minc from 3 to 6 and Y-axis is set to the time cost minu 17 is also applied to control the total time cost The time cost of A D 1 decrease dramatically according with the increasing of minu and minc  C Time Cost Reduction with Reverse Index In Figure 12 the number of CPU cores is 48 X-axis is three algorithms and Y-axis is set to the time cost minu 16 and minc 5 are also applied to control the time cost A  D 1 is the algorithm without the revert index A D 1 obtains considerable performance improvement with search space reductions D Scalability test of algorithm A D 1 In Figure 13 time costs seconds are recorded according with the increasing of CPU cores from 3 to 192 and minu  17 and minc 4 are applied to control the total time cost The second row is the total time cost the third row is the time Fig 12 Time Cost Reduction with Revert Index Fig 13 Execution time vs CPU cores cost of all the mappers while the fourth row is the time cost of all the reducers the last row is the time cost of standalone steps in the process such as generating the share revert index In Figure 14 X-axis is set to be the number of CPU cores and Y-axis is set to the time cost reduced multiples The total time cost when CPU core number is 3 is set as the baseline while the value for any other CPU core numbers are 26162 divided by their total time cost The time cost for task deploying data transferring and the job management increases with the increasing of CPU core number and also there are some standalone steps in the algorithm As a result the total time cost is not exactly reduced linear related to the increasing of CPU cores yet still reduced dramatically The values in the last row in Figure 13 are almost consistent For this test data set after the the CPU core number become laster than 96 the total time cost will not reduce very much more for the time cost portion of standalone steps becomes considerable VI C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed a novel algorithm for context-aware role mining Role mining problem has been Fig 14 Scalability of algorithm A D 1 473
