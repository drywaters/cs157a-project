operations. Category management includes three strategies efficient store management \(abr. ESM\fficient product promotions, and efficient product introduction Efficient store management mainly refers to customers face directly to the store and at this level the important thing is to optimize the management of stock and shelves Efficient product promotions are to maximize customer satisfaction and increase the number of transactions by more promotions to achieve this objective, such as the payment for satisfaction or low prices every day Efficient product introduction is to maximize new products of development and introduction 
How to achieve cost-effective management of stores optimizing the goods management of the store is one efficient ways. After the actual research, shop due to their respective regional characteristics and the different characteristics of consumers, operations of goods and scale of the stores is a slightly different, so the different promotional activities and management of goods to the stores is in the research II  S TORE C LASSIFICATION P ROBLEMS  Let the chain enterprises as the S, one store as Si then

Below the fuzzy cluster model to classified the chain stores based on single-store association rules is to be designed, next how to use this mode realize the different management according to the different store is discussed IV  T HE C HAIN S TORE F UZZY CLUSTER M ODEL B ASED ON THE G OODS ASSOCIATION RULES  A  Fuzzy cluster and FCBA Fuzzy Cluster [8  f r om a  n u m b er of t h e v a ri ou s n e e d s  characters of users, find the statistics which can measure the similar features among the users or among the needs characters, constitute a matrix of symmetry similarity According to the similarity degree, classify the users or needs characters one by one. The little clusters include some close user or needs characters and the large clusters include some far users or needs characters. Until the entire user needs or completed variables are gathered to form a hierarchical relationship for a more natural and intuitive user to show Category the difference and contacts are showed among the users or the needs characteristics Distributed Store management models combine association rules and fuzzy clustering to do a series data mining and the whole process is called FCBA model. The FCBA firstly gets the sales of different store and extract the association rules, and compare the strong rules of every store to build a similarity matrix, which is calculated by the same degree of association rules, and then use fuzzy clustering method to get the stores category [10, 11, an  Fig.2: Distributed Store Management Model B  Similarity Factor Firstly, get the sales of different store and extract the association rules of separate store, Secondly, compare the strong rules of every store to build a similarity matrix, which is calculated by the same degree of association rules The definition of similar factors as ij r If the two store i  and j have the same rules 1  ij r if two stores have not exactly the same rules, then      AllRules Sum SameRules Sum r ij   1 0   ij r  For example, All rules is 8 6 rules are same in the table so 75  0  ij r   Snack foods  Candied fruit  Seafood  F ried fruit Walnut  Chen Pi Mei  Tomato  Match maker fish  Small Yellow Croaker  Squid wire    Mango Stem  Pistachios  M ore flavor peanut pecan    Association Fussy Cluster Store Category Promotion Similarity Matrix

Through practical application, the model is feasible. Next, how the marketing tests on the basis of classification will be studied further A CKNOWLEDGMENT  Hongbo Guan thanks for the help of Baoan Yang who is tutor of Donghua University.

 F  To check the validity of association rules  E quatio n  1  is use d  as  it is done i n  th e  last column of  Figur e  7   G  Select one  of th e  rules which have Improvement  value more than   1     H  In case if there is another job asking to get the files  and the s e files are available in the same sites then  choose another rule to serve the new request  Otherwise  apply  Aprior i  algorithm for recent STTs  of  new replicas sites    VI I   I NTERPRETING THE  R ESULT S    This section means to explain how the association  rul e s work better than the traditional and random methods  As it is shown in  Figure 7 after applying  Aprior i  algorithm  we get  602  different rules which can be used to select the  best combination of replica sites   Let us explain Figure 7  in details    Rule #1: if Site\(s S 4  S 7  are selected then this implies  that site\(s S 3  can also be selected at the same time. This  rule has 100% confidence    In other words, it means if site  S 4   and  S 7  are selected to  work together to transfer the requested files, t h en this  implies site\(s  S 3  can also be selected to share the work at  the same time. This rule has confidence  100  This  particular rule has  confidence  of  100  meaning that  S 4  S 7   and  S 3  can be selected as a best set of replicas by  Replica  Manage r  to ge t  requested files. To compute the correlation  of this rule and see how far it is better than choosing the site  randomly, we use an Improvement equation     indicates that it has support of  26  transactions, meaning that in transaction  Single Trip  Time  Table  there are  2 6  concurrent uncongested trips of  S 4  S 7   i.e. these sites have similar network conditions in particular  time      indicates the total number of transactions  involving uncongested trips of  S 3   in  Rule 1  is equal to  174    This is a piece of a side information; it is not involved  in calculating the confidence or support for the rule itself       is the number of transactions where   S 4   S 7 as well as   S 3 has uncongested trips. In  Rule 1  it is equal  to  2 6       or   indicates how much  more likely we are to encounter  S 4  and  S 6  transaction if we  consider just those transactions where  S 3  S 5 and  S 8  have  uncongested trips. As compared to the entire population of  the transactions, it's t h e  confidenc e  divided by  support \(c   where the latter is expressed as a percentage   For  Rule 1 the  confidenc e is  100   support \(c  in  percentage   174/194\*100 = 89.6 9 So, th e    Lift ratio = 100/89.69.1 = 1.1   As it is clearly shown in  Figure 7  some r u les with  an improvement value less than one means this is an  unreliable rule. Whereas the rule with a value more than one  means this rule is better than random replica selection with  number of time equal to improvement value as it is shown in  Figure 8                   When improvement value is more than 1 it is better to use  EST to select replica sites, because it selects the sites able to  work simultaneously    I n  Figure  9  we sho w  the  comparison between EST and  traditional model using highest bandwidth a s  a criterion to  select the best replica. As we can observe our technique has  a better performance most of the times because it selects the  sites which have the stable links. In traditional method the  site which has the highest bandwidth does not always me a n  to be the best because sometimes this highest bandwidth  link can be congeste d   Let us declare more by the following  scenario  o f  Figure 1 0 suppose   S 0   be the computing site  and let   S 1  S 3   S 1 4   be replica sites  Red stars referring to  congested router s   Using traditional selection method the  file will be got from S14 since it has less number of Hops  routers\ and highest and also has highest bandwidth link         Figure 8.

               Using  ES T the replica   S 3    is selected as a best replica  because the link b etween  C S  and  R S  is uncongested     VII I   C ONCLUSIO N  In this paper we presented a dynamic replica  selection strategy that aims to adapt at ru n time its criteria to  flexible QoS binding contracts specified by the service  provider and/or the client. The adapta b ility feature  addressed by our replica selection strategy is inferred from  the observation that the basic metrics, which influence the  QoS that the user perceives when accessing a replica  depend directly on the application being replicated and on  the cli e nts\222 preferences. To reach this objective that, we  used   the concept of association rules of data mining  approach to the most stable links sites in order to reduce the  searching space the response time and network resources  consumed    A CKNOWLEDGEMENT S  Au t hors wish to express their sincere thanks to  Prof. Arun Agarwal, from GridLabs Department of  Computer and Information Sciences, University of  Hyderabad, India for providing all the infrastructural and  computational support required to carry out this work  His  academic suggestions to improve the quality of the work are  also highly appreciated and acknowledged   R EFERENCE S     M  Rashedur Rahma n   Ken Barke r   Reda Alhaj j    Replica  selection in grid environment:a dat a mining approac h    Distributed systems and grid computing \(DSGC\,pp: 695  226  700  2005    J.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
