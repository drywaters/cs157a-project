Hierarchical Clustering En semble Algorithm based Association Rules  Taoying Li and Yan Chen Transportation Management Collage Dalian Maritime University Dalian, China ytaoli@126.com  Abstract 227Present, there is more research on supervised clustering ensemble algorithm, but the research on unsupervised clustering ensemble is studied less. In order to partition data points under fully unsupervised conditions, the hierarchical clustering ensemble algorithm based on association rules HCEAR\proposed in this paper. The optimal number of clusters is determined by average degree of clustering using distribution of all clustering memberships and support degree of 
association rules. Then variation of the hierarchical clustering algorithm was adopted for best partition. Related theories ware proved detail in this paper. Finally, the HCEAR is applied in instance and results show it is effective Keywords c lustering; hierarchical clus tering; association rules clustering ensemble I   I NTRODUCTION  Clustering is to group data points into several clusters that the intra-cluster similarity is maximized while the inter-cluster similarity is minimized [1-3 W ith t h e d e v e lo p m e n t o f d a ta mining, some ensemble methods integrating some clustering methods were advanced recently, Topchy proofed that the ensemble method can be better than any single clustering 
algorithm in [4-5 Clustering ensemble is to integrate some results from some existing clustering partitions for higher quality and better robust. In recent year, ensemble learning technology has been widely used in many areas, such as biology feature recognition, Computer-aided medical diagnosis, text recognition, web information filtering, analysis of seismic waves, and so on. Early research on ensemble learning technology was focus on supervised learning, and the research on unsupervised learning, equals to clustering ensemble, is in the initial stage [6-7 h e cl u s teri n g en se m b le is to searc h a mutual partition from results of different clustering algorithms and has been proved to be a full NP problem In the process of clustering ensemble, above all, we should generate m clustering memberships of dataset 
X and then integrate the results of these m clustering memberships according to the mutual function. The research on the design of mutual function is a hot topic in clustering ensemble Almost all of existing clustering ensemble methods needs to pre-design thresholds that are difficult to choose, such as coassociation matrix advanced by A.

HCEAR makes use of the distribution of clustering memberships combines m subset of Descartes with support degree of association rules, and then achieves the partition by variation of hierarchical clustering This paper is arranged as follows: In section 2, theory of HCEAR algorithm is presented and proved, and then give the steps and analysis the complexity.

Assume that the s th cluster and t th cluster were chosen in the i th clustering membership, and they can be revised as          1 1 2 1 m i i m j j s j j j C   and               1 1 2 1 m i i m j j t j j j C   From the definition of m  subsets of Descartes, we can see s i m i i m C j j s j j j C  1 1 2 1              t i m i i m C j j t j j j C  1 1 2 1                   According to the clustering analysis, we know that the intersection between any two clusters in a clustering is empty set, that is   t i s i C C   so          1 1 2 1 m i i m j j s j j j C                 1 1 2 1 m i i m j j s j j j C This conflicts with assumption, so the theorem is proved to be correct Theorem2 full m Descartes contains all points to be clustering Proof We assume full m Descartes do not contain all points, that is to say that there are points not in full m Descartes. Let        2 1 m m m p j j j C x   According to clustering analysis, all points have their own clusters, which equals to that if and only if one cluster in any clustering membership contains x p Let these clusters are k q m q q C C C   2  1   2 1 and they meet i q i p C x    i 1,2 m  so k q m q q p C C C x   2  1 2 1  and x p is a element of a m  subsets of Descartes. On the base of Definition3        2 1   2  1 2 1 m m m q m q q j j j C C C C k  so        2 1 m m m p j j j C x  and it conflicts with assumption. Thereby the assumption is wrong and the theorem is proved to be correct Theorem3 The number of non-empty sets in all m subsets of Descartes is greater than or equal to i i k max  Proof Let i i k k max max   We assume that the number of non-empty sets in all m subsets of Descartes is r and meet r   max k and the nun-empty sets are Q 1  Q 2  Q r In any clustering memberships with the number of clusters greater than r we can find clusters that contain the r sets. Assume the r sets be C i,j1  C i,j2  C i,jr in the i th clustering membership R i  which equal to l j i l C Q    r l   2  1  o r j i r Q Q Q  2 1 C C C j i j i 2 1    According to Theorem 2 r j i j i j i C C C    2 1 contains all points Consequently, each C i,j  max k j r   a subset of r j i j i j i C C C    2 1 which conflicts with the nature of clustering that the intersection between any two clusters are empty. Thereby the assumption is wrong and the theorem is proved to be correct Then we introduce the support degree of association rules Definition4 support degree of set A is the number that all clusters of l clustering memberships contain A which can be denoted as formula \(5     l i k j j i i C A A Sup 11    5 Here    else C A C A j i j i  0  1    m l   1  By the Definition3 we can see that the maximum of support degree is m and the only support degree of non-empty m subsets of Descartes and their subsets is m If Sup  A s l  then sup  A be l  m l   2  According to Theorem2 and Theorem3, we know that  n C k m i i    max and let m C l    Definition5 average degree of clustering R i is a ratio between the sums of maximum support degree of each cluster multiplied with the number of points in the cluster and the number of clusters multiplied with the number of all points. It can be shown as formula \(6 


      i i i k j k i k j i i C Sup C nk R Average 1    max  1   6 Here i k j   1  m i   1  B  Optimal Number of Clusters of HCEAR Let    i i R Average inversr F   m i   1  The optimal number k of clusters of HCEAR is i R that meets formula \(7    inverse min min 1 i m i i i R Average F   7 In order to calculate easily, we can add X as a clustering membership while the number of clustering in all clustering memberships, which ensure the support degree of any set is greater than 1. According to w e kno w t h a t t h e op t i m a l  number k of clusters meets n k  so we only consider clustering memberships whose number of clusters be equal or less than n  C  Processes and Complexity of HCEAR The methods searching for optimal partition can be divided into two types, one is to learn clustering memberships that meet the number of clusters equals k and the number of them at least equals to 3, Otherwise, it donít not possess statistical characteristics and cannot achieve the purpose, the other is to learn all clustering memberships, which should prune the X if X is a clustering membership The Steps of HCEAR searching for optimal partition can be shown as follows Step1: Init the number i of times of operation, go to Step2 Step2: Search the nun-empty subsets whose support degrees are m-i there are two sets A and B and they meet B A  then A can be pruned from existing sets and let the number of remaining sets be l go to Step3 Step3: If l  k then go to Step7, else, let i  i 1, if  2   m i en go to Step2, else, go to Step4 Step4: Calculate the number of elements of intersection between any two different set from l non-empty sets, and we can gain a under the half-angle matrix A which is q p pq Q Q a A     and meets l q p    1 then go to Step5 Step5: Search the max pq a merger Q p and Q q as Q  p add row and column of Q  p to matrix A and remove rows and columns of Q p and Q q  and other subsets of Q  p Then we should re-calculate the value of l go to Step6 Step6: if l  k then go to Step7, else, go to Step5 Step7: if the intersection between any two different sets is empty set, the clustering ensemble is end, and we can stop the operation, else, go to Step8 Step8: Search set A and set B which meet the number of elements of intersection between them is maximum, then find the set C whose support degree is maximum among sets that contains B A If C B C A  then prune B A from B  else, prune B A from A go to Step7 The time complexity degree of CEFS in [11 is   2 mkn O  and that of HCEAR in this paper is   3 mk O Because the number k of clusters meets k  n thereby the time complexity degree of HCEAR is far less than that of CEFS III  I NSTANCE A NALYSES  There are 30 points need to clustering, and their proper partition are {{1-10},{11-20},{21-30}}, where j denotes the j th points.

Many existing clustering ensemble algorithms need to pre-design initial thresholds, which influence the results of clustering ensemble directly. The HCEAR \(hierarchical clustering ensemble algorithm based on association rules\ is proposed in this paper. The algorithm implements clustering ensemble under full unsupervised condition. The algorithm adopts hierarchical clustering to partition points by making use of the distribution of results of all clustering memberships and the support degree of association rules. The theorems and definitions were detail proved. Finally, the algorithm was applied in practice data and results show that the HCEAR is superior to anyone of the clustering memberships and itís effective R EFERENCES  1 H  Y  W a ng  H  B L u Z  P  L i  S t udy o f  hig h  d i m e ns io nal  da ta  cl us te r i ng  based on cluster ensembles algorithmî, EL ECTRONIC MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY, Chengdu: South West Jiaotong University Press, vol.31, No.4, 2008, pp.41-45. \(In Chinese 2 A  S T R E H L  J  G H O S H  C l u s t er en s e m b les a  k n o w l ed ge r e u s e framework for combining multiple partitionsî.
