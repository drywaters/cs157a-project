Kumar10@infosys.com Manonmani Kumar UTSW Medical Center USA manonmania@gmail.com Abstract To address the current need of innovative technologies that blend rapid data processing capabilities of computers with intuitive decision making skills of humans we have developed a prototype of Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface CEB decision making technologies The implemented architecture integrates cloud enabled big data analytics capabilities networked BCI Brain Computer Interface devices and Decision Making Engine The novel CEB technology comprises of 1 Cloud-enabled BCI Brain-Computer Interface headsets which is developed and networked in a cloud to enable rapid decision making and 2 Genetic algorithm based decision making engine to intelligently assist the users in decision making Advantage of our architecture is that when CEB loads the data it will automatically recommend the best applicable Machine Learning ML algorithms after being evaluated to solve a given problem Hence with such automated machine learning techniques CEB users workload is signi\002cantly reduced Our experiments on DARPA dataset indicate that CEB technologies performed 10 times faster and about 4 times less false negative rate than current computational methods in seeking and understanding information Our results demonstrate that these CEB technologies would enable humans to accurately and quickly detect meaningful information from a mass amount of data The novel CEB technologies ensure that the reduced manpower does not result in reduced performance Index Terms Intuitive Decision Engine Genetic Algorithms Cloud Computing Brain Computer Interface Measures of Intuition I I NTRODUCTION Computers can process vast amounts of data in a short time but programming them to detect patterns is extremely dif\002cult Humans on the other hand are adept at extracting patterns from large amounts of data yet are limited by the rate at which they can apply these cognitive abilities to large amounts of quickly changing information Consequently  computers have low success rates when tasked with detecting relevant and important information embedded in complex data streams while humans are unable to effectively process large amounts of data that are fast becoming a hallmark of todays decisionmaking environments Compounding the problem traditional support technologies like decision aids and visualization tools create an arti\002cial barrier which plays to either the strengths of computers or the strengths of their human operators but not both This problem could be addressed by imparting human intuitive skills to the computers Intuition is the process through which humans quickly make sense of partial incomplete or rapidly presented information Intuitive decision-making processes are associated with rapid recognition of patterns among incoming streams of information followed by retrieval of associated knowledge without conscious attention The neural processes underlying intuition occur on a very rapid timescale and can be captured by non-invasive imaging technologies In parallel to the non-invasive imaging technologies discoveries advances in bio-inspired adaptive data analysis techniques like genetic algorithmic modeling are now being used to 002lter and sort information that is presented to humans To achieve this 002rst hunches are generated around likely human responses Then human behavioral responses are used to establish the plausibility of such hunches Finally the re\002ned information is being presented through multiple iterations of this process Also it should be possible to augment the support of these bio-inspired data processing techniques by integrating into them with the neuro-cognitive measures of intuition Combined with cognitive and behavior-based measures of intuition neural measures should provide signi\002cant improvement in measurement accuracy This w ould enable humans to accurately and quickly detect meaningful information from a mass of data In this paper we present the technologies for intuitive decision making to augment the current data processing techniques This will enable humans to rapidly analyze large amounts of information in complex information environments We have demonstrated that higher the amount of information processed per unit time lesser is the overall decision-making time In Section II we have discussed the related work that is ongoing in this area In Section III we have explained our Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface Architecture CEBCIA and the decision making engine Section IV discusses our preliminary experimental results In Section V we present our conclusion and our future direction II R ELATED W ORK In recent years a number of data mining algorithms and knowledge discovery technologies have been developed and applied for 002nding information from the ever-growing various data sources such as structured unstructured relational

applications and domains However these existing technologies lack with respect to autonomic intelligent information processing operations across multiple modalities of the data  7 State-of-the-art MapReduce computing algorithm is implemented on parallel and distributed real time Hadoop or Storm  computing platform which is used to support search engines recommendation engines and big data analytics in wide variety of applications However Hadoop-MapReduce technologies alone are inadequate to perform autonomous data discovery and analysis operations across various data sources e.g Department of Defense Global Information Grid Human Intelligence Collection Open Source Intelligence Collection etc and data types e.g text video audio images etc This is due to the reason that they are incapable of seeking understanding and presenting information and moreover both Map and Reduce functions are implemented on 002xed nodes Cloud computing technologies have been used for analyzing electroencephalograms EEG using neural networks The performance of the EEG processing on the cloud is much better than these most approaches using single EEG devicesingle user For instance 150 users use the cluster of 10 machines 1GB of EEG signals is processed every 83 seconds and over 1TB of data is processed in a day Ho we v er  current cloud approaches has the following limitations 1 They not designed to improve human decision making techniques 2 They need to speed up to process 1TB data in less than 1 hour over 24 times faster than current speed Currently the BCI technologies are in early experimental stage Potential targets are identi\002ed by the BCI-human system based on the data fusion from the analyst 0 s brain responses and button clicks when the images are presented to the analyst with a rate of around 3 to 10 images per second In order for the BCI technologies to solve real world problems the following new capabilities are needed 1 Ef\002cient computing infrastructures such as cloud computing to enable real time analysis and big data analytics 2 Mathematically and biologically precise models of human brain functions in order to capture and reuse human brain capabilities such as rapid decision making skills learning and reasoning 3 Better reliable economical and practical BCI devices in order to quickly and precisely capture and use human conscious mind ideas and neuro-cognitive measures via cross cortical waves and coherences cognitive indicators etc for individuals and teams of humans To address these limitations our objective is to create a real time Big Data Analytics tools by synergistically integrating our innovative Intelligent Agents with real time Hadoop framework streaming data processing tools and proven machine learning algorithms ML We have utilized the open source Mahout Rapid Miner and Weka for the machine learning algorithms and leveraged the proven source codes of our intelligent agents and Blackboard pattern enabled agents  We also participated in the Department of Defense DoD Neuro-technology for Intelligence Analysts NIA program to accelerate Imagery Intelligence IMINT analysis The vision for DoD's NIA program is to revolutionize how analysts handle intelligence imagery increasing throughput of imagery to an analyst and overall accuracy of assessments NIA seeks to identify robust brain signals that can be recorded in an operational environment and process these in real-time to select images that merit further review Investigations of visual neuroscience mechanisms indicate that human brains are capable of responding visually much more quickly than they respond physically Successful development of a neurobiologically based image triage system can increase speed and accuracy of image analysis where the number of acquired images is expected to rise signi\002cantly III D ISCUSSION OF THE A RCHITECTURE AND T ECHNOLOGIES A Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface Architecture Our CEB architecture consists of 1 Wireless BCI headset devices 2 A novel cloud computing infrastructure capable of processing real-time data streams 3 A novel Decision Making Engine based on ML technologies and 4 Algorithm Selection Optimizer to support a large number of concurrent users As shown in Figure 1 our Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface Architecture is designed by creating and integrating cloud computing technologies Brain Computer Interface BCI headset systems and Decision Making Engine By moving the analyses of BCI-human data to the cloud our CEB architecture can avoid the limitations of existing mobile BCI applications Instead of having a single computer dedicated to a single user the CEB users can have a private cloud of clusters or computers serving many users This approach has the following bene\002ts over existing methods 1 By aggregating various datasets and users BCI headset signals CEB users can have much larger datasets that can be used in the machine learning ML algorithm libraries 2 A CEB user can leverage a group of experts and multiple ML algorithms that are spread across a cloud This would enable users to work together for a collective decision and thereby avoiding biases human errors or knowledge gaps of a single user 3 Through more complex analysis with the Cloud MapReduce paradigm streams from the Electroencephalography EEG to the BCI headset devices can be analyzed over both immediate and longer intervals of data with respect to trends patterns and knowledge sets The protocol that an user need to comply with our CEB tools to solve a speci\002c problem are as follows
