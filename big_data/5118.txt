Abstract A set of advanced analytics methods is investigated aiming at easier and higher quality e-/m learning or blended tutor ing. Security systems \(SS been considered as an example of difficult-to-learn area The topic of the presented investigation are contemporary education threats that will lead to big problems in the nearest future. It is shown that today the prev ention of such threats is almost impossible without applications of intelligent technologies. Even more, the contemporary education system should possess some features of intelligent technologies or smart systems and advanced analytics elements. Original results are presented on how to build more effective classical applications by using novel puzzle 
methods. It is shown that all the demonstrated advantages may be successfully combined with other known methods from e-learning, m-learning or oth er education fields. Also it is shown how the considered applications enhance the quality of teaching, improve the emotional connection between the teacher and students and hence serve their sustainable learning and developme nt. It has been discussed that qualitative forms of education may not require the usage of expensive hardware Keywordsóeducation; advanced analytics; synthetic methods; mode; intelligent system; se curity system; blended methods I I NTRODUCTION 1 
Contemporary recession times turn govermnets pay more attention at the education problems accumilated since decades. It is easy to follow that the sustainable development of regions depends on sustainable careers of local people. Bulgarian gover ment reports around 30% of young people with university diplomas and its goal is to make this number 40%. The tendency at the national level is using more and more sophis ticated education tools and standards. However, the hardware and student accumulation isnët the right decision to the quoted problems. Advanced hardwa re \(and standards\mean enlarged maintnance teams and help stuff. All professors or teachers also should improve their special software 
knowledge, etc. This is a long time- and money 1 The paper is published with financial support by the European Union under Bulgaria-Serbia IPA cross-border programme, project IPA MORESYN EDU, CCI number 2007CB16IPO006-2011-2-14 consuming process. Otherwise there is a risk of ineffective use of expensive resources In this paper an advanced analytics method is considered aiming to improve the quality of the deep learning. Intelligent software agents, etc. play more and more important role in cont emporary \(e systems 
and in blended education [1   The quoted tools are  especially effective in rapidly changing environments like SS. Suggested innovations serve the more effective application of advanced analyt ics, \(deep\data/web mining and/or collective evolutiona ry components. Contemporary training of intelligent agents reaches such a high level that some elements of machine learning became practicable also in education. It is time to transfer the effective strategies from machine l earning to school/university education. The research is based on a series of puzzle methods for intelligent knowledge/data processing elaborated within ULSIT-Sofia. The versatility of the proposed approaches is demonstrated also by their successful application for 
training soft agents or holons in the area of SS. The presented series of experimental results revealed accumulated problems that require the application of sophisticated modern intelligent methods for educational purposes: tendency to memorize rather than thinking, also named sha llow learning, which starts from small classes of school education, the lack of attention due to the use of computer games and the too active use of Web forums and resources for communication, the desire to receive high marks without a deep understanding of the presented subject, etc. These accumulated problems canít be solved using only traditional teaching methods. In the ongoing recession in the country we cannot allow the use of expensive technological solutions such as using smartphones to 
connect directly with the course data and video images of lecture material, G4 met hods for m Under these conditions we developed a relatively inexpensive technology for modern teaching based on a minimum of technological solu tions that do not require high costs of purchasing and support   II P UZZLE M ETHODS The below considered methods had been designed for applications in different research sy stems. It is shown that 


198 almost the same method applied in other way gives new results suitable for applications in SS and other sophisticated training. On the other hand, teaching SS stands out from other undergraduate and graduate programs that it operates in rapidly changing models requirements, concepts, tools, instruments and policies where the problem for qualitative education is particularly difficult. Teaching highlights in the brightest way the advantages of the proposed new methods and applications in intelligent security systems \(ISS One of the most instructive facts about the audience for training is that current neural-based machines in the form of software agents or holons repeat the actions of the teacher on a much higher level, even related to an excellent student. Therefore, rote learning, simple memorization of lectures makes no sense: sooner or later machines will displace us from similar low-tech activities instead creative learning should be deeply rationalized through comparisons with other research accessible through the Internet, by experimenting with numerous courses and with open source products which become more pervasive in our practice together with contemporary Web-applications. The above example illustrates how to achieve simultaneously two goals: explain essential principles of artificial neural networks functioning and modern principles of quality training through effective and deep understanding. Similarly, usi ng the neural networks examples explains best practices for control of knowledge for more tests for lagging stude nts, etc. The application of the below described methods makes the lecture process more easy, understandable and transparent. Hence sustainable education results are obtained. Advanced data analytics methods are not easy to explain. However, their correct applications doesnët make the education complicated, because they are purposed to find more easy and effective ways of presentation On the other hand, monito ring the quality of education processes most often uses different statistical methods We used same methods in a general advanced analytics module together with logic applications described in this paper. The unification of logical and statistical parts come together using evolutionary ways Those cardinally different results canët be used just in one simple bunch of data or knowledge Diring the evolutionary process of joining statistical and logical data/knowledge, th e accumulation of knowledge makes logical applications more and more effective and more universal than the probabilistic ones fuzzy estimates/similar applications. In the common case during data analytics processi ng, there is no convergence of the results but this does not hamper practical applications of these systems. In other words, bad and good designers will arrange the display window in quite different ways and there is no guarantee that every user understands the technology and that his access to the system will have positive results. In general, the use of synthetic methods is one of the most important and demanding elements of the efficiency of intelligent applications. But the winning combination of the proposed methods in the educational fiel d depends on the lecturer's experience, which makes the performance much simpler than just in the automatic case. At this level, the operation of the advanced analytics module is limited to implementation-vol untary advices to the lecturer Suggested innovations serve the more effective application of education practice altogether with data analytics applications, collective evolutionary components, etc. For more inform ation sf. the book  The research on traditional, sy ntactic puzzle methods reveals that their algorithmic co mplexity is rather high and this doesnët allow automatic processing of large enough sudokus, crosswords or puzzles. In the case  an accent should be made on the fact that the investigated machinebased procedure took the words from a predefined set using a random principle where only the lenght of the word is of importance. On th e contrary to the quoted syntactical realizations, bel ow a puzzle method is considered which is based on the logical analysis of the existing data or knowledge interconnections. Three types of relations have been used aiming at narrow the set of possible solutions of the problem Briefly, every puzzle method aims to discover new or hidden knowledge by connecting the unknown, the sought solutions with previous experience accumulated in knowledge bases. Let the constraints of the considered problem form a curve in the space as depicted in Fig. 1 The main goal of the puzzle method is to reduce the multidimensional search space fo r the solution. For this purpose we used several limitations  the study is focused at the case of using ontologies instead of a set of nonlinear constraints, etc Figure 1 Binding and other constraints Furthermore, the research of process dynamics aimed at reducing the field in certain cases allows us to derive new knowledge in the form of rules as discussed in the 


199 next section. This inference process and the usage of different constraints gi ves way to significant simplification of formal and evidence material in lectures attracts the attention to details and simultaneously increases the activity of learners. Sh owing the process of connecting known to unknown improves understanding and retention of the presented material For example, if a bachelor who has graduated ULSIT lives in Sofia and he/she does not want to work anywhere else, then the line \(curve this way a lot of avoided It is also possible to inspect a case when the constraint is defined in the form of surface but as a result a more general solution is obtained where a special interest is provoked by the boundary ca se of the crossing two or more surfaces. When the common case is inspected in details then in the majority of cases the problem is reduced to exploring the lines instead of curves with complicated forms obtained as a result of crossing surfaces. Therefore below we investigate the usage in systems of constraints by lines of first or higher orders The V i constraints of linear/nonlinear form are the classic case borrowed from constraint satisfaction methods. The B-D binding constraints doesnët intersept the unknown go al but are located close to it, they reveal a neighboorë area around the target. The A-C-E constraints are named the crossword constraints because their interseption with G 1 gives a part of the searched goal where C i form larger interconnected areas in G 1 The usage of the considered set of Ci-s is much more effective than of the classical set of  V is The following example shows how the search process can be reduced using on tologies. Letís admit that the search space is presented on Fig. 2 where statistical data about SS are generalized about the regions depending on their price and quality. The goal: it is necessary to select an acceptable SS to our project. Let the right vertical blue-coloured, subset of feasibl e solutions is chosen excluding ISS designed outside Europeí. Then the space of feasible solutions is to the left of the separating surface which is depicted on the figu re in the rightmost corner In Fig. 2 another horisontal surface, depicted in the high corner in green, is shown delimiting the search space of the solutions. In our case it means ësystems with unknown principles of operationí. It is accepted that in the data bases there is no clear distinction related to the presented criteria so the search of the feasible solutions is nonlinear, of high dimensionality, and practically it cannot be solved using traditional methods. Nevertheless, by applying ontologies the pr oblem is solvable via the proposed puzzle method. There are two red dots depicted in the left corner on the same Fig. 2. Each of them also represents a kind of constraint but of another type which we name a binding constraint and it is introduced and researched by us. Its semantics is the following: it is not a solution but it resides close to the searched solution Figure 2 SS application example By introducing new constraints or, sometimes ontologies our goal is to show that it is possible to use causal links different from impli cations and that they help us search the goals in a more effective manner In the tutoring case, using the crossword constraints from Fig. 1 also helps us reveal the dynamics of the problem solving process wh ere the resolution process is sometimes more important th an the proof itself. The usage of Vi constraints one by on e doesnët always form the necessary closed area. Revealing Vi and other constraints one by one helps represent the resolution process in its dynamics and hence make deep inference to the problem Even in the worst case, when the accumulated knowledge is incomplete for the problem resolution, the dynamics of what is represented analogicaly to Fig. 1 will show up what should be the resolution. The binding/crossword constraints are the form of non-implicative rule-based relations. Their application effects are discussed in the next section III V ISUALIZATION E LEMENTS Essentially the puzzle methods  include a form of visualization, which leads to a creative work in various forms of training. We would lik e to remind that the high quality learning inevitably le ads to independent research In the present study it is s hown that in some cases the graph itself from Fig. 1 ma y be sufficient for decisionmaking by the user or the expert Different versions of the modeled knowledge contained in Fig. 2 provide a base to describe things that are difficult to express in words. Not surprisingly, a Chinese aphorism states ëA picture replaces thousand words.í It should be added: ë... and is understood and memorized better.í Below are given different linguistic equivalents of combinations of interpretations, similar to that of Fig. 1 and obt ained by puzzle method 


200 Things are moving way that neither ... nor ... but it is too close to Looked at from another angle ... Other findings An object can be represented as intersection of two dynamic areas In the future, these two concepts should be used jointly etc These natural-language fragments can be presented in plain text for learners but further it is shown that by the puzzle method this is executed much more naturally and better. For example, Fig. 3 show another example of puzzle method application revealing certain processes and relationships between objects Concentrating the attention in the closed area of Fig. 3 and narrowing the set of analyzed elements supports the revealing of new implicative relation M-N referred to in Fig. 4. Informal causal relations are elaborated that are associated with the implication ëfrom M it follows that N   V 1 M V 2             N     V 3  Figure 3 M, N are unrelated, belong to confined area In Fig. 4 the system of th ree different constraint sets helps detect a causal relati onship between M and N, with no evident correlation between th em in Fig. 3. The connection occurs in imposing additional constraints in Fig. 3. The process is dynamic in nature and it is almost impossible to be properly explained only with words. Here the set of the pictures has a role of the replacement of the intuition process The process of finding new rules using puzzle methods gives the trained people necessary deep knowledge. This form of knowledge can be sometimes respresented in the form of ontologies The image \(or media\ Fig. 3-Fig. 4 is convenient and efficient to visualize, transform and use different dynamic processes through sense-based explanations Examples and figures can lead to the conclusion that ontologies are introduced, use d and dynamically changed applying the puzzle methods Hence they can be improved using puzzle methods  A V 1 M B V 2          D      N  C  V 3 Figure 4 Detection of the rule connection MñN Unlike the traditional oral presentation, the material visualized by the puzzle me thod gives more directions for  own r e search and f o r detecting a nd c o rrecting gaps in knowledge. For example, ëit is neither ... nor and many other natural-la nguage interpretations incorporate a lot of fuzziness that can sometimes be misunderstood. Careful study of graphs similar to Fig. 4 excludes presentation incomleteness and furthermore ñ a misunderstanding of the materi al. On the other hand, the whole learning process is concentrated in one place, it is not necessary to look for other Web sources to clarify the question e.g. ëwhyí, ëwhat howí to get results, etc. The quoted relations also have been used for pointing the lecture main points. Intelligent training tools not only accelerate but also intensify the training. Hence its high quality A wide range of tools for m odeling and presentation of material is used in this section where the modeling must be used not for ISS software agents but for people Respectively it is easier to introduce audio or multimedia presentations, for example, ontol ogies for transmitting the meaning of things. Sometimes to present the meaning of things it is enough to show one or several key points of the subject altogether with corresponding explanations in visual, graph or sound form Sometimes one key picture with concize explanations is better than an entire movie Of most importance are the descriptions to a picture that describe the essentials, important details, and the sense of the presentation. The picture explains many details clear to people, but intelligent agents will learn nothing from this picture, especially if the agents are designed only for SS purposes. Hence many agent-based methods are much more effective in people tutoring systems Information presentation by meaning is a key element of modern higher and university education. The proposed puzzle methods altogether wi th the other tested methods greatly expand opportunities for qualitative teaching in the field of SS, one of dynami c interdisciplinary specialties 


201 with increased complexity and also of various types of strict and high requirements for the learners IV E XPLORATION OF E MOTIONS C ONTROL The control of student emotions is a perspective and rapidly growing field of contemporary learning and education. It can help us resolve many of the negative issues quoted in the introd uction. Really, without the curiosity element all the hi gh-level education strategies will be ruined. We are far fro m modeling the curiosity elements in software system auto m atic deciphering of different hu man emotions. Instead we concentrate attention on research of emotional elements in different puzzle method appli cations in blended learning which undoubtedly bring comf ort learning conditions It is revealed that puzzle methods lead to dynamic results obtained during the education process. Of course these results bring much more positive emotional elements comparing to presentations of ready formulas, theoretic schemes, etc. Hence any results obtained via puzzles have a practical element well understandable by students The considered practical application scheme consists of three elements accompanying every lecture material game elements incorporated in the lecture itself,  curiosity reinforcement and self-learning \(homework\Using Game Theory elements or, for example, ëolympicí competitions help us to reveal most active students, give them bonuses and other reinforcement awards Actually the active study at the classroom activates not only the group of best learners but also many others who can compare their results to others. Puzzle methods attract attention to important elements of the considered process, they ease the natural process of ont ology \(sense\formation in studentës heads. The system of class competitions and reinforcement of people studi ed additional material at home completes the quality, deep education process necessary in case of SS and other contemporary theoretic/technological fields. E-l earning is very welcome at the homework stage. Years ago there was a field named cognitive graphicsí  aiming at revealing hidden mathematical relations via color-based graphics ëmovies Its driving force was to wa ke the studentís curiosity to informal and beautiful things like repeating patterns, parts of the image leading to new formal proofs, etc. In the present research we use some analogical elements altogether with advanced analytics and brainstorming sessions with purpose to get rid of inactive rote learning and only repetitions of teacherís words at the exams. The student group positive emoti ons are one of the important parts of this process and it was found out that deep knowledge brought by puzzl es can help us in the case. The considered experiments and the perspective research canít be completed soon What is done till now for the sake of comfort learning conditions The presentations are multicolored where different colors correspond to differ ent meanings explained in advance. A strong system of meaning explanations makes learning simpler and easier, tow main parts of positive emotional contact First of all, the accent is on essential, basic things and on mutual relations between them, even during most intensive courses. Difficult-to understand technical details may be studied in addition, la ter, at home, for example via e-learning system, and then tested via competitions at class, and so on Such a modular course structur e leads to the formation in the minds of essential defi nitions/strat egies/know-how base. It makes the links bet ween universities and high schools/colleges stronger and more natural. It is obvious that the most introductory part of some university lectures can be presented at schools aiming at finding most interested and active pupils read y to develop some research at early stages of the education process All of the considered tactics, principles and methodologies are purposed for structuration of knowledge what is important what is perspective and what should be learned in a particular order because it is essential, etc. The intensive presentation should be emotional and may use different game styles to escape the boredom because of the lack of attention. Puzzle methods help us in case Today the lack of attention, love to computer games and other shortcomings explored in the introduction may be compensated using game-based learning strategies and application of some emotional elements. Hence the affective learning should be strict ly controlled by a system of education methods and go od practice. Otherwise the speaker may lose the control ove r the intensive or deep and high quality learning V C ONCLUSIONS The main conclusion is that to overcome the contemporary education shortcomings, methods and applications are considered concerning the logical parts of advanced analytics. The role of th e above methods for different education pu rposes is discussed Analysis is represented for technologies used for discovery of sense, sending in formation by sense, and for understanding the semantics of the presented material Common advantages and di sadvantages for different groups of contemporary applications have been revealed Same methods in different combinations are effectively used to enhance secu rity stuff possibilities or in contemporary e-learning system s in the field of Information/National Security  Since a long tim e  applications in/outside the field of information security have been made in education and tutoring systems concerning the most difficult education cases It is shown how, by ap plying the principles of advanced analytics technology for lecturing pupils students, there is a substantial rise in the quality of lecturing even for the most difficult disciplines, and there is sustainability in the impl ementation of the studied 


202 material, which obviousl y leads to sustainable development of the regions. Deep understanding of the presented material is necessary in case. It can be obtained only by a combination of applied blended education methods, like puzzle methods, with enough practical experience made by each of the trained people at home office or other place outside the education hall. The deep understanding of the material is impossible without the self-training, and the above me ntioned advanced analytics methods are purposed to attract th e interest to the field by showing up hidden and deep interconnected relations R EFERENCES  L.

Fig 4 The ping time distribution before and after the improvement Fig 5 Mean response time before and after DTS improvement way in the following set of experiments we focus on the evaluations of its impact on both the mean response time of the latency-sensitive applications and the average turnaround time of the system as well Our results show that with the dynamic time slice both the mean response time and the average turnaround time can be more or less improved In this experiment we measure the mean response time of VCPUS by adopting the BS benchmark To this end we rst conìgure the measured machine as a search server which includes four guest OSes and observe the responses to the search requests in different intensities from these guest OSes We then use the average of the response time over the four guest OSes as a metric to evaluate the DTS algorithm As shown in Fig 5 the mean response time after the DTS improvement is gradually reduced compared to when the improvement is not employed This observation is not surprisingly As the search service is deployed in the virtual machines it could happen that there are multiple processes running on the same VCPU When the VCPU is boosted in addition to the I/O processes other compute-intensive processes would enable the BOOST VCPU to execute a long time which is not necessary After the improvements the time slice is adjusted to 2ms only allowing the I/O processes to have the BOOST VCPUs while others having the UNDER VCPUs In the gure when the request intensities are low the mean response time before and after the improvements is almost the same This is because in this case there are not that many BOOST VCPUs waiting in the queue However with the intensity growth the results after the improvements is clearly better than those before improved because a large number of BOOST VCPU could be produced as a result of the ever-increasing requests In Credit scheduler the time slice for the UNDER VCPUs is set to 30ms whereas in the improved algorithm we adjust this value for the UNDER VCPUs based on their queue lengths and optimize the case when such a queue length is less than a default value In the measurements to avoid the impact of the multicore architectures on the scheduling algorithm we deliberately conduct the experiment on a single PCPU by creating different a number of guest OSes which could further result in a different number of VCPUs for the same PCPU Additionally we deploy  on each gust OS and adopt its primesum 3 as the benchmark to measure the CPU performance Table III shows the compared average turnaround times between the after-improved and the before-improved when the number of VCPUs in the run queue is varied from 1 to 8 Given the default queue length of 4 we can observe that the turnaround times after the improvements are obviously lower than those before the improvements and the difference between them is gradually increased with respects to the execution time as shown in Fig 6 The reason is that when the number of UNDER VCPUs is less than the default value the algorithm sets the time slice by 60ms in order to minimize the scheduling overhead However when the queue length of the UNDER VCPUs is greater than the default value both the improved and unimproved algorithms have the same time slice of 30ms As a result they exhibit approximately the same turnaround time These results demonstrate that when the number of UNDER VCPUs in the queue is small increasing the time slice can clearly improve the system performance Fig 6 Difference of the average turnaround time between beforeimproved and after-improved the default VCPU queue length is

in Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMETRICS Joint International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems various software and hardware con\223gurations leading us to the recommendation that prefetching algorithms be applied to any of the proposed cache con\223gurations in order to increase the hit rate and decrease the system power consumption In addition we have examined the effects of a likely future expansion of FTP server size on the EROS system and found a slight increase in hit rate in addition to the expected substantial increase in power consumption Although the bene\223t of prefetching diminishes as cache sizes become larger we continue to suggest the use of prefetching as a mechanism for offsetting the cost of powering additional hardware The cost of expanding the FTP server farm to 200TB would contain not only a signi\223cant up-front investment about 8 million dollars but an increasing power draw Our experimental results Table II demonstrate that the EROS system can maintain the same level of performance with 31.78 of power savings by using our proposed popularity-based and user-speci\223c prefetching algorithms compared to doubling the size of its FTP server farm Therefore we suggest administrators of large scale massive storage systems fully explore all possible software optimizations before physically expanding the existing system
