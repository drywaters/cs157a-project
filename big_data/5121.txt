However, the size of huge data may consume higher time and extreme number of discovered patter n Unfortunately not all the discovered pattern from t he frequent mining is interesting pattern Hence frequent patte rn mining algorithms producing numbers of frequent pattern s till parameter uses in minimum support and which frequen t itemset producing better pattern remains fairly open. It is important to gains some limitation of minimum support to be appl ied to the frequent mining algorithm so that we not end up at compiling higher patterns including a normal pattern We prop ose a procedure based on quick parameter setting to estim ate minimum support and also frequent itemset Our empi rical validation shown the procedure will extract ranging  minimum support and frequent itemset to be considered to ge nerate interesting pattern  Keywords   frequent pattern mining minimum support frequent  itemset  I  INTRODUCTION Frequent patterns discovered via data mining proces ses are interesting and useful for other data analysis and data mining tasks such as association, classification, and clus tering just to names few Data mining involves the semiautomatic discovery of interesting knowledge such as pattern s associations changes anomalies and significance s tructures from various kinds of database into information rep ositories Analysing a collection of sequenced data over a per iod of time aims to identify certain patterns or trends in the data. In identifying interesting patterns, a common measurem ent uses in frequent pattern are support and confidence leve ls The interesting patterns often occur at varied level of support To determine minimum support to be applied by user in generating interesting frequent patterns is critica l part in frequent pattern mining This initially motivated m ore research in this field For instance in collection  of hospitalbased information systems data containing various s et of data-sequence may correspond to the symptoms or dis eases of a patient with a transaction corresponding to t he symptoms exhibited or medication prescription durin g a visit to the doctor. The patterns discovered using this d ata could be used in disease outbreak detection or unusual event  or even detecting new diseases attacks Patternís strength is based on how often it occurs in the given data If it occurs frequent enough then the pattern is said to be interesting [1   I n  d e t e r m i n e  t h e  p a t t e r n produce are to be interesting the measurement of which minimum  support to be uses very much depending on the data  The existing algorithms in generating the frequent data  sequence required supply of for minimum support. Traditional ly values for minimum support greater than user supplied then the rules consider as interesting This hypothesis applied in  the rules interestingness measures for association rules The  issues in frequent mining are how the sequence itemset occurr ence is counted and how many is enough II  BACKGROUND As one of the application applying mining frequent pattern is to detect pattern in a set of sequence transaction Data such as in the emergency department data patient record i n the network logs or other transaction-based data are se quencelike data Basic methodology of frequent pattern mi ning is based on apriori concepts Generalized Sequence Pat tern Mining GSP is the extension of apriori algorithm that applies concepts hierarchies and temporal constrain ts This method guarantees finding all rules that have a use r specified minimum support.

T he ideas is to evaluate l- itemsets first, then find frequent sing leton itemsets and evaluate their supersets 2-itemsets and the pr ocess will go on until no more frequent itemset is found. With the userspecified support min_supp the process finding fr equent pattern can be view as following Discovering all f requent itemsets  A subset X of I is called a frequent ite mset if its support at least min_supp supplied. The Apriori alg orithm to mine association rules was introduced in [6   G i v e n a dataset that contains sets of items called instances a m inimal support threshold and a minimal confidence thresho ld Apriori mines all the association rules from the da taset that have support and confidence above the thresholds We now summarize itemset methodology formally as follows 6   Let I    I 1  I 2   I m  be a set of literals called items  Let D    T 1  T 2   T n  be a set of n  transactions where for each transaction T    D, T  I A set of items X   I is called an itemset A transaction T  contains an itemset X if X   T  Each itemset X  is associated with a set of transactions T X    T    D   T    X  which is the set of transactions which contain the itemset X The support supp  X  of itemset X equals T X  D   Based on the above definition the main concern is the support\(X of itemset being determined to achieve interpretable usable and interesting patterns gene rated Identified few recently studies towards finding the  ways to determine minimum support According to 12  t h e  t e c h n i q u e s  f o r  a d d r e s s i n g  t h e minimum support issues are underdeveloped There ar e several identified approach such as general samplin g 7   Randomized counting 8   f e a t u r e s  s e l e c t i o n   9    p r ofilebased approach 10  f o r  q u i c k  p a r a m e t e r   H a n  e t  a l  used strategy to mine top-k frequent pattern 13  a n d  W a ng et al designed a confidence-driven approach without minim um support [14   H o w e v e r  b a s e d  o n   1 2    m o s t  o f  t h e  a p proaches are only attempt to avoid specifying the minimum su pport Checking the minimum support or threshold values to  satisfy an output size constraint implies to the co unt of frequent itemsets The problems in counting itemset  are considered as NP hard problem. The constraint is to evaluate the maximum support and minimum support for the fre quent itemsets The main shortage in randomized counting is dealing with the calculation the main problem is repeated count ing procedure Implementing Markov Chain algorithm in randomized counting not depend on the number of fre quent set but the size of the dataset. The desired accura cy is based on sample sizes. While in [7  t h e  s a m p l i n g  i s  n o t  t aken from data but from the pattern space sampling. Highlight ed in the study [8   t h e  M C  a r e  n o t  g o o d  b o u n d  f o r  g e n e r a l  c a ses.  The finding indicated for cases in which the cost of fr equency counting is dominated by the number of frequent ite msets straightforward randomized counting produces reason able approximations in a fraction of the time needed for  exhaustive enumeration. Space state sampling is foc us on the post-processing of the data mining process. Expert or domain expert are needed incorporated during the different ial extraction to set the constraint Analysing the relationship between pattern frequenc y and its predictive power require some quality features Hypothesis if min_supp greater values, value in frequency are higher, this known as overwhelming While the min_supp lower dow n medium frequency are discovered However if furthe r lowering the state of over fitting will occurs.  It is the other approach in feature selection to overcome method o f enumerating all feature combination Feature filter ing measures are used to determine the minimum support 9   Yan 2005 10  s u m m a r i z e d  a  c o l l e c t i o n  o f  i t e m s e t s  p attern using k representatives It solved the interpretabi lity of the number of frequent pattern by monitoring change of the support restoration error Found that the smaller k  is always preferred but may not provided valuable information  Recently partial support 11  a n d  polynomial approximation and fuzzy estimation 12  are other a techniques uses to compute interesting itemset in f requent pattern mining. Nevertheless, the techniques are ye t to come out with general strategy for setting the minimum s upport. In the cases of outbreak detection which minimum suppo rt to generate frequent items are important due to huge a mount of data and multiple sources The issues of a given se t of frequent itemset, with specified support how should we select the high quality for effective detection outbreak i s also questionable The propose procedure are based on sa mpling techniques. The procedure to determine for setting minimum support and possible frequent itemset are compute b ased on mean III  PROPOSED  DESIGN  PROCEDURE The procedure in selecting the possible minimum sup port and also numbers of frequent itemset to be uses in the outbreak detection are proposed in three main stage s Stage one as the pre-processing stage follow by frequent  itemset algorithm and stage 3 as data re-transformation. Th e figure 1 show the steps involved in the experiment settings   Fig 1: Procedure in determine minimum support and i temset count 


  978-1-4244-4944-6/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE   92   Pre-processing stage involved 2 main modules sele ction module and transformation module. At the selection module focused are on determining the potential attribute to be included in the process. The attribute that are sel ected based on the most frequent occurrences attribute. In this study we used the WSARE dataset where the attribute needs to  be removed and reduced to meet the number of cases rep orted in the synthetic outbreak release day. In the data tra nsformation module, data need to be prepared for apriori algori thm At the second stage apriori algorithm is applied t o generate the frequent itemset There are two tasks in the second stage needed to complete in this experiment The first task is to determine the minimum support and the se cond task is to identify length of the sequence k-length  Series of experiment were carried out by adjusting the minimu m support values. The values of minimum support are a djusted in incremental of 10.  A set of frequent itemset wi th k length later refer as itemset\ are obtained and recorded The process was repeated by adjusting the minimum support Tabl e I showed the recorded the mean for each minimum suppo rt applied and table II recorded mean counts for k-len gth frequent.  The re-transformation stage, were the ou tput of the frequent mining algorithm will be used as an import ant threshold in the outbreak detection tasks  IV.EXPERIMENT  The experiment involved 3 dataset namely as ZOO an d TIC TAC TOE gained from UCI data repositories. The third dataset are taken from AutoLab for WSARE implementa tion of outbreak detection A  Dataset Preparation The WSARE dataset used in identified the possible minimum support to be considered in detecting outbr eak using frequent itemset methodology  The WSARE data set consist of synthetic data for the outbreak detectio n. There are 100 datasets that represents a health care record w here the person in the simulation city perform the main acti on visit the emergency department purchase medication or ab sent from school or work Each dataset consists of one day deliberately anthrax release The dataset chosen in  this experiment are from dataset 0 to dataset no 2 \(PT0 PT1 and PT2 Dataset PT0 the anthrax release on weekend While dataset PT1 and PT2 the anthrax release are on week days The records were considered 5 days before the anthr ax release and 5 days after the anthrax release. The d ays before anthrax released are captured the normal behaviour patterns while 5 days after viewed the pattern caused by ant hrax release in simulation city datasets In this experi ment we included 9 attributes used in the dataset The data set  PT0 PT1 and PT2 consists information on region, age, ge nder, flu level day of the week action reported symptom d rug and day num Data from UCI, Tic Tac Toe was consider because of the predictive class is only 2.The possible combination is always not more than 2 combination with 9 attributes Whil e zoo have 17 attributes to be consider in generating fre quent itemsets B  Result The Fig 2 had shown the minimum support applied ranging from 10% toward 100% for each day in each d ataset The result identified for PT0 PT1 and PT2 that the  10 to 20 support was not given good indication of increa sing in frequent itemsets. When reaching 70% to 100% the fr equent itemset count becoming stable The fluctuation only  can be visualized through 30% to 40%. In Tic Tac Toe the i ntersect was indicated at the 20% minimum support. Due to th e nature of data prepared for tic tac toe the graph show th at higher count to be consider are only for the 10% to 20%. M inimum support for zoo dataset reached 40% to 50% shown in the fig 2.  Higher count for 10% due to 17 attributes to be considered in generating frequent itemsets The X is uses to s how the intersection of each dataset uses  e9œ≥Î©™jYñ<œ◊uEJ   x·TW«◊/–l 0ÉØﬂﬂ∏∏‡“›=Ë-{≠qA% ˚ƒâGè ˚Î◊Ø≥gœJ-^ºÆó†…¯Õ2jkk[ZZñ/_‰æzı*22®fŒú9YàÇã/B¨Ä(ÿ¥iPU¬XÈ I 2zzzäãã·"˚ˆÌsvv~¯°úúDAMMMss3F˘˘˘IKKOü>¬}ÙËëºº¸ﬁΩ{ùúúH2ó˘XMËÌÌ£ ?∏uÎVII…ÊÕõÅÏó/_äââÌ€∑œŸŸ˘·√ár∞‚X≠‘÷÷B‘ ÎëÇÇ'''båzıÍU}}˝å3 {zz‘’’˜Ó›◊N§…∏Ãáˆ˜˜C 5∏pÁ’≈;//ﬁy}·ŒKb‘´HöiJZÈHk cWû^{Ü†b6Vf3I	3M  6Vhˇæ„-M»"b6ç-¨<<ÙwÃØﬂO›x~Ê∆ãS◊üΩx˜øbiA3MI+i-˙8oåÇë=z$//è,‚ÎÎ€‹‹¨ØØd˜ˆˆñîî‡“˚ˇˇ8˚’´Wì'Onii yıæ€o>¥+Ñ∏86ƒ{Bÿè=íóóáK’‘‘8:::99aÍÍÌÌ†-xÙËëºº¸ﬁΩ{ùúú´ÏÌÌôöhHòiH	ÒqP—£`åÇ¡=z$//øwÔ^'''¸*{{{KJJ W∆√…f x ¨t 2∫J.zJ.‹úÇ‘r“†?ﬁΩ{{˝êÒ˙‚Ö7◊ØΩΩvçHçl<<¬öZBöZb@3≤ÏÔﬂﬁz˛È(?‹ΩÚ˚≈5ˆ˘~?‡e˝ä√<öÄ∑Ã¸ü˘ﬁ±â˝d  0˛f˛ˇ‹íx Y__üëë±ßßß∏∏òFv}¸¯ëüüŒΩuÎñ∫∫:MmÑ†7ÂÂÂÈ`óüüüØØ/ê°¨¨ÏÏÏ¸·C999™€ÒçG¿Xò5kVjj*≠Ì¬ΩΩΩ%%%>|@N9T≥gœNKK˚ˇˇ?\dﬂæ}4ä2`™êññû>}:\d≈äëëë@∆Àó/≈ƒƒ»6   Fig 2: Minimum support Based on the figure 2 results, the percentage of mi nimum support to be considers in the next experiment.

IV PERFORMANCE STUDY In this section, we present a performance comparison of CIU algorithm and FP-growth algorithm The data sets that we used for our experiments are generated randomly. Figure 5 shows the results of test of run time. In our experiments, there are 50K transactions in primitive database. The run time shown in the figure is the incremental run time. Th e figure shows that the incremental run time can be reduced down by about one-half in the CIU algorithm, and the gap grows wider when the number of incremental transactions grows up Figure 5 Run time with incremental transactions V CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have investigated the problem of continuous incremental updati ng in large databases. The contributions of this paper are summarized here: 1\ We have proposed an optimization technique for reducing the database size during the update process. 2\ We have give the definition and algorithm of transaction tree T-tree The order of items in every transaction in T-tree is different from that in FP-tree  3\ We have proposed a continuous incremental algorithm, or CIU algorithm for short. 4 have implemented the CIU algorithm, and studied its performance in comparison with FP-growth algorithm in large databases A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China 70971004 REFERENCES 1 R  A g r a w a l  T   I m ie l i ns ki a n d A   S w am i  M i n i n g A s s o cia tio n Rul e s  between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc.

Figure 3 Precision-recall curve in ROI-250 image dataset 5.3 Experiment 3 Mammograms-1080 image dataset This experiment employed a dataset composed by 1080 mammograms images collected in the Clinical Hospital of University of Sao Paulo at Ribeiro Preto The dataset was previously classi\002ed into 4 levels of breast tissue density 0501\051 mostly fatty 050362 images\051 0502\051 partly fatty 050446 images\051 0503\051 partly dense 050200 images\051 and 0504\051 mostly dense 05072 images\051 Figure 4 Precision-recall curve in Mammography-1080 image dataset Breast density is an important risk factor in the development of breast cancer In this experiment the images are represented by the feature set proposed in b uilding a vector of 85 features including shape and size of the breast the conditions of the breast contour nipple position and the distribution of 002broglandular tissue This dataset was divided in training set and test set The training set is composed of 720 images and test set is composed of 360 images Figure 4 shows the P&R curves over test dataset and also the number of features selected in each method Again the proposed methods reached the highest values of precision and select the smallest number of features 050a\051 050b\051 050c\051 050d\051 Figure 5 Queries in Mammography dataset 050a\051 226 is the query image 050b\051 using the features selected through 002tness function F cB  050c\051 using the features selected through classi\002cation error of C4.5 and 050d\051 using the all features extracted Results for the retrieval of the 5 most similar images from a query image are also provided in this experiment as illustrated in Figure 5 The image 5.\050a\051 is the query image taken from the mostly fatty image class Images shown in 5.\050b\051 are the 5 most similar images retrieved for the proposed 002tness function F cB  The row 050c\051 shows the results for C 4  5 classi\002er whereas 050d\051 illustrate the images resulting from all features 050no selection applied\051 In Figure 5 the images surrounded by dashed lines are false positives 050not relevant images\051 For this query the proposed method achieved the highest precision 050100%\051 when compared the results of C4.5 and the original feature vector 050precision of 40%\051 


6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
