Recently nearly all researches of association rules are based on intratransaction. They all focus on the relationship among web pages. But user is the center of all the internet services, and they should be given more considered. In this paper, a new method of predicting users` behaviors based on intertransaction association rules is proposed. Through the improved Mafia algorithm, the maximum frequent itemsets with CUI can be found. We generate the inter-transaction association rules, discovering the relationship among users predicting next pages the user visited. Experimental results prove that this method provides more accurate prediction results than former researches, and users will get more of the content they want Keywords: Web usage mining, inter-transaction association rule, improved Mafia algorithm, maximum frequent itemsets personalized services I   I NTRODUCTION  In the Internet, the most important thing for a web site manager is how to make users who visit the web site with a comfortable feeling 1 While the most important thing is how to get he wants conveniently for users. Web usage mining  based on traditional data mining technology which is used for discovering users` interesting patterns and browsing behaviors. It can satisfy all the needs above Association rules is a web usage mining method which describes the potential association relationships between users and pages. There’re two kinds of association rule intra-transaction association rules and inter-transaction association rules  Opposite to the former one, focuses on the relationship among the web pages in one user browsing session 4 the latter one can make predictions in different browsing sessions. Considering users must be the center of all the network activities, we commence seeking for the relationship among users This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss the background of study and the related works. In section 3, a new method is described in details. In section 4 Empirical results and analyses are presented. Section 5 presents the conclusions and our future works II  B ACKGROUND  A  Basic Description of Web Association Rules A complete statement of a web usage mining database included a set of n users, U u 1  u 2  u n and a set of m web pages transactions, P p 1  p 2  p m We set p i as a transaction and the users who have visited p i set as its items Each transaction marked by a TID \(Transaction ID\ number for recognizing simply A formulation is raised p i  u 1  w  u 1  u 2  w  u 2   u n  w  u n  When a user visits the web site, he or she may leave browsing history. As the formulation above w  u n a weight value. If it equals 1, the user u n has visited the web page p i if it equals 0, the user hasn’t visited the web page This paper proposed a method that mines intertransaction association rules among different users who visited the same pages. Through analyzing the visiting history, it can predict what the user might be visited next time B  Definitions and Properties For mining inter-transaction association rules, related definitions and properties are given as follows Definition 1 \(Sliding Window Inter-transaction association rules are generated from different transactions. It uses the data from the whole database, no doubt that the computing is very complex. So sliding window technology   can be used to control the data flow. Sliding window W is a block of n continuous data, the amount of blocks named w  the number of sub-windows\. As figure 1 w 4 Definition 2 \(CUI When maximum frequent itemsets have been generated, CUI\(common user itemset\ is an intersection which recorded the TID, those items in a transaction of the original data has been occurred at the same time Definition 3\(Support The support of association rules Y X 000 equals the support of Y X 002 If support value is large, the association rule is important, otherwise it is useless The formulations are       sup D X count X port      sup   sup Y X port Y X port  000

We will achieve it through 3 steps. They are data preparation, model discovery and association rules generation A  Data Preparation The data from web logs can’t be used directly. This step is important to the accuracy of the result 8 and it’s necessary for a better discovering result of inter-transaction association rules. It filters the redundant data, and then transforms the data format B  Pattern Discovery Through the improved Mafia algorithm, the MFI maximum frequent itemset\ and CUI \(common user itemset can be generated. We converse intra-transaction to intertransaction, and analyze the inclusion relation of different items in sliding window. Users’ interesting was found in the final Steps are as follows Step 1: Find out and store the MFI in appropriate format In the Internet, the information is huge. So Mafia which can manipulate huge data efficiently was chosen. However it can’t record the TID intersection of which items in original database occurs at the same transaction. So we improved it Now it can not only find the MFI, but also stores the useful TID intersection, which we called CUI  Algorithm 1 Generating MFI and the relative CUI with improved Mafia algorithm Input: The whole database Output: MFI and CUI input the database Mafia Creating DFS space and candidate itemsets tree Simple\(Current node C, MFI  Three kinds of pruning mechanisms 1.Parent Equivalence Pruning PEP\(Current node C, MFI  2.HUTMFI Superset Pruning HUTMFI\(Current node C, MFI  3.FHUT - Frequent Head-Union-Tail FHUT\(node C, MFI, Boolean Is HUT  MFI found Generating the CUI for each transaction in MFI Acquiring the TID occurs in original database read from the original database for \(get a line  store each\(transnum1,Tidset1\ in table1  end for Creating CUI read from the file included maximum frequent itemsets information for \(get a line from MFI  split every number in every MFI find \(transnum2, Tidset2\ in table1 store \(transnum2, Tidset2 Intersect intersect \(transnum2\amed CUI Tidset2,CUI\ is the every transaction in MFI and the relative CUI store \(Tidset2,CUI  end for CUI is the key to mine inter-transaction association rules Because of comparing the inclusion relation of CUIs, we can find the association rules

 Step 2: Transforming the MFI from intra-transaction to inter-transaction Through the continuous moving of sliding window, the value of CUI has changed by pruning method. When it cannot satisfy the pruning criterion, it will be eliminated Finally, the user pattern was generated The beginning of each sliding window is a nonempty transaction. Assuming that t represents a TID which is stored in CUI, n was the number of a sub-window. If t appears in nth sub-window, t must exist in the sliding window which started at t n 1. If t n 1 satisfied the following pruning methods, we eliminated the transaction included t n 1 Pruning criterion 1  If the item in TIDset is less than 0, equal to 0, beyond the max transaction or contains nothing 2  If two TIDsets included each other, only leave the set which contained another Algorithm 2 Transforming the MFI to inter-transaction MFI, for generating the user pattern Input: MFI and CUI which brought by algorithm 1 Output: Inter-transaction MFI and user pattern read from the result of algorithm 1 for\(1 n w  for\(Tidset, Transaction num2  New Transaction num t  n 1 Add New_Transaction num to New Intra-transaction Maximum Frequent Itemsets  Pruning method for\(each New Transaction Method 1 if\(New Transaction num 0 || New Transaction num New Transaction num > Max Tidset number delete New Transaction num Method 2 if\(New Tidset 1  New Tidset 2 delete New Tidset 1 end for With the methods above, the inter-transaction MFI has been discovered, and then the inter-transaction association rules can be discovered C  Inter-transaction Associ ation Rules Generation The inter-transaction MFI was found in step 2, giving a minconf value and finding out the contain relation between sub-window d th e pos te r i o r  s u bw i n d o w s  s ee  t a b l e  3    the association rules could be build if some items were contained in other items 4 Otherwise, we run the pruning mechanisms till the last sub-window 10  For example, in figure 3, the rate of inclusive relation between sub-window an d s u bw i n dow 1 is  6 7   th i s  value is greater than the value of mincof -- 60%, then the association rule can be generated as sub-window[1 subwindow   IV  E XPERIMENTS R ESULTS  The database used in experiments includes 17 different tags in a website Firstly, the format of this database was as table 1, after data preparation, the format is adjusted as table 2 TABLE I  THE ORIGINAL FORMAT  Users Web pages U 1  Homepage, Homepage U 2 Weather U 3  Tech, Weather, Weather U 4 Living U 5 Homepage  TABLE II   F ORMAT AFTER TRANSFORMED  Web pages Users Homepage U 1 U 5 U 7 U 11  Weather U 2 U 3  Tech U 3 U 10  Politics U 4 U 10  Living U 6 U 8 U 9 U 10   Next, MFI is generated by using the data in table 2 Assuming sliding window number is 4, the minsup is 40 Using algorithm 1, MFI and CUI can be found. Then we transform intra-transaction MFI to inter-transaction MFI The result can be seen as table 3 TABLE III  U SING SLIDING WINDOW TRANSFORMS THE MAXIMUM FREQUENT ITEMSETS FROM INTRA TRANSACTION TO INTER TRANSACTION  No Users\(sub-window CUI 1 U 5 U 4 U 9 U 8 U 3 U 12 U 6 U 14 U 13 1  2 3 4 5 7 14  2 U 1 U 12 U 6 U 13 1  3 4 5 6 9 10  3 U 7 U 10 U 4 U 15 U 8 U 3 U 12 U 14 U 13 1  1 2 3 4 5 7  4 U 11 U 4 U 3 U 12 U 14 U 13 1  1 2 3 4 13  1 4  5 U 4 U 2 U 3 U 12 U 14 U 13 1  1 2 4 5 7 13  6 U 16 U 12 U 6 U 14 U 13 1  4 5 6 7 10 13 7 U 1 U 12 U 6 U 13 2  2 3 4 5 8 9 8 U 16 U 12 U 6 U 14 U 13 2  3 4 5 6 9 12 9 U 1 U 12 U 6 U 13 3  1 2 3 4 7 8 10 U 16 U 12 U 6 U 14 U 13 3  2 3 4 5 8 11 11 U 16 U 12 U 6 U 14 U 13 4  1 2 3 4 7 10 The minsup is 40%. The minconf is 60%, we named it as a fault-tolerance value, if the rate of right recommending pages above or equal 60%, that means the recommending results would satisfy the users` expectation

For example, from column of CUI, there are 67% of same items in line 7 are included in line 1. This value is above the minconf.

Using the inclusive relation between CUIs, the intertransaction association rules can be found. This method is easier and much more efficient compared to the traditional association rules. It can not only recommend more pages to users, but also inherited the superiority of Mafia algorithm which deals with huge database efficiently ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No.60603047\ience and Technology Plan Projects of Liaoning Province \(Grant No.2008216014\, Liaoning Higher Education Research Foundation \(Grant No.2008341\ Science Foundation for The Excellent Youth Scholars of Dalian \(Grant No.2008J23JH026 R EFERENCES  1  I-Hsien Ting, Kimble, C., Kudenko, D., “Applying Web Usage Mining Techniques to Discover Potential Browsing Problems of Users”, Advanced Learning Technologies, 2007.

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
