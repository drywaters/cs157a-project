aiming at the performance of the MIA; Secondly, we use this algorithm to excavate association rules, and propose a new algorithm of association rule mining, then we can verify that the algorithm is feasible and effective  through theoretical analysis and experimental result s  Keywords-Immune algorithm Metropolis criterion; MIA Association rule mining I   I NTRODUCTION  Immune algorithm is the computer model which combines with computer technology to solve practical problems, and it has got inspiration from biological system so it is the combinatorial product of bio-immunology and computer science. In 1986, Farmal et al involved the concept of "Immune Algorithm" in one article called 
001 The Immune System, Adaptation, and Machine Learning 001 From then on the study of immune algorithm has aroused the interest of more and more scholars in the international arena. In the twenty years, the results of these researches have been involved in data mining  network security  pattern recognition 3 combinatorial optimization 4 and so on. At present, the research of artificial immune algorithm is in full swing and still immature. There are still some questions to be deeper studied, such as the questions of early maturity and search efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Metropolis criterion of simulated annealing mechanism based on 
immune algorithm, which accepts ill-conditioned by a certain probability, consequently, the improved algorithm is better to escape from local extremum, improve the speed of convergence speed and avoid degradation etc Association Rule Mining is an important branch of the research field in Data Mining, which is uesed to discover the related rules between different commodity\(item\ in the transaction database. These rules reflect behavior model of buying of customer, such as the impact of purchasing some merchandise. Since Agrawal et al firstly raised the issue of association rules mining in 1993 5 the study of this problem has gained considerable development in some aspects and proposed many mining algorithms. One of the most 
influential association rule mining algorithms is Apriori algorithm which is mostly as the core of the rest of algorithm, just to take into improvement and expansion However, some of the existing algorithms still widely existe the questions of larger amount of calculation and lower efficiency of excavation etc, therefore, a fast and effective algorithm for association rules mining is urgently needed Based on the above problems we try to introduce the MIA into the association rules mining II  T HE IMMUNE ALGORITHM BASED ON M ETROPOLIS CRITERION MIA A  Metropolis criterion Metropolis criterion is an importance sampling method 
proposed by Metropolis et al in 1953. In the simulated annealing algorithm the criterion of state changing from i to j is the corresponding transition probability, which can be expressed as   002 1 002   Where 002 f\(i\\(j\\(i\d f\(j\ are the values of objective funcition in the state i and j; T is the temperature in the process of annealing, which is the control parameter P t  j i 000 ines whether or not to accept the transition from the current solution i to new solution j. We generate a random number in range of  us i n g t h e  number generator, when the value of P 
t  j i 000 er than the random number, the new state is important state and take the new state as the current state, or else give up the new state and accept the original state by a certain probability P t Then it iterative generates new state B  The structure of MIA operator In this paper we carry out some improvement for the traditional immune operator, that is, introduce Metropolis criterion into the selection operation of immune algorithm The improved immune operator is made up of two steps which are vaccination and Metropolis selection. The former is to improve the fitness of individual, the later is to prevent the degradation of group and to accelerate the speed of convergence. The specific description is as follows 
1  Vaccination Set up individual b 001\031 R n b = \(b1 bn\ated to them means to amend some genes of the b according to the prior knowledge, so that individuals 000 000 000  003  000 002           1    i f j f e i f j f j i p t t

could have the higher adaptation degree with the greater probability. These prior knowledge can be the probably value range of the optimal solution's some component, may also be certain restrictive relation between some component Moreover, the operation should meet the following conditions: if b is already the best individual, b transfer to b with probability 1; if b is the worst individual, that is, every gene of b with is different from the best individual, b transfer to b with probability 0. Let the Groups B = \(b1 bN\ated to B is a sort of operation that randomly selected N 001  001 N individuals according to a certain proportion 001 0 000  001  000 1\. The vaccine is extracted from the priori knowledge of the problem, and it contains information and its accuracy that play an important role on the efficiency of the implementation of the algorithm 2  Metropolis selection That is, we test individual which was vaccinated. If the fitness of offspring is better than the generation of parent, it will enter into the next generation instead of the parent, which ensures the best individual of group to enter into the next generation; If the fitness of offspring is smaller than the generation of parent which shows that the group has appeared  serious degradation in the genetic process, then this group enter into the next group by the probability Pt of the formula \(1\hat is, this can limited accept ill-conditioned while accepting the best individual, which ensures the diversity of group and avoids falling into the local extremum  3  The flow chat of MIA    Figure 1  Figure 1 the flow chat of MIA 4  The  theoretical analysis and experimental verification of MIA a  The theoretical analysis of MIA Metropolis criterion can limited accept ill-conditioned, the probability of acceptance of the ill-conditioned slowly tends to zero with the temperature decreased, which can make the algorithm may jump from the local optimum and find the global optimum solution as far as possible. In the early period of algorithm, that is, the temperature of system is higher, it can accept the new solution algorithm of no improvement by the higher probability, and can effectively avoid to fall into a bad situation in this period; In the later period of algorithm, that is, the temperature of system is lower, it can accept the new solution algorithm of no improvement by the lower probability, and can ensure the convergence of the algorithm while reducing the convergent time of algorithm Therefore, through the theoretical analysis we can know theimproved algorithm can further  solve the degenerate phenomenon of the current algorithm and improve the speed of convergence after introducing the Metropolis criterion b  The experimental ver ification of MIA 002 In this paper we carry out simulation test by using a traditional test function, the function is as follow 2  10 sin   x x y 004  x 005  002 2 002  This is a multi-peak one-dimensional variable function which is commonly used in the detection of evolutionary algorithm. In a given range, it has a number of local extremum, the maximum value f\(1.85\.85 The simulations of IA and MIA  are shown  separately as follows Figure 2   Figure 2 The figure of simulation From the figure 2, we can see that the convergence speed of MIA is more  quickly than IA; The average optimal value of MIA is 3.8468 while the average optimal value of IA is 3.8298; Compared with IA, the running state of MIA is more stable Therefor, through the above we can know that the overall performance of MIA is better than IA

 III  T HE ASSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON MIA A  The design of coding transaction database is mainly used for the discovery of association rules, and some datas\(that is, the values of attributes be interested by users\ are the specific object application. Therefor, in this paper we adopt the method of real-coded. The real number is used to express the data \(that is, antigen\ which is disposed in data mining, and the antibody X is made up of a set of real numbers Suppose that the fact table is composed of age, sex,income occuption, category of commodity\(where the age has five values, the sex has two values, the income has ten values, the occuption has twenty values, the category of commodity has thirty values\ the range of coding is from 0 0 0 0 0 to 5 2 10 20 30, where the attributes not chosed are expressed by the number 0 B  The structure of the fitness function The fitness is the sole basis of selection operation of immune algorithm, and it is the symbol of immune algorithm which is directed search different from random blind search The fitness function react as bridge between optimization problem and immune algorithm, therefore, the design of the fitness function directly affects the performance and efficiency of immune algorithm when it solves practical problems. MIA must needs in accordance with the value of the fitness function when searching. Therefore, we must solve assessment question of individual in order to  assess the advantage and disadvantage of each individual In the association rules mining, the rules discovered must meet some certain Conf\(x\pp\(x\, that is, Conf\(x Supp\(x\ are the two important parameters of association rules. Therefor, in this paper we take the fitness function as follows 002 3 002   Where Ws+Wc=1, Ws 006 0, Wc 006 0, Suppmin is the threshold of support, Confmin is the threshold of confidence C  The algorithm steps of association rules mining based on MIA   Randomly generate value of each attribute, select this value by the probability i 007 which takes zero take the others values of attribute by the probability 002 1i 007 002 its range is an integer which is randomly chosed from one to the number of this attribute When the corresponding selected probability i 007 of some attribute is zero, this attribute must exist in association rules mining, and if i 007 is not zero, then the corresponding attribute does not necessarily exist in association rules mining. Choose n original antibodies by circulation, the order of each attribute of these antibodies is the same while ensuring that each attribute meets the condition of the threshold of support. Thereout, the original group of antibody A 0  is formed   Calculate the value of fitness of each antibody according to the formula \(3   If the current group has included the optimal solution that is, the antibodies which have been got meet the minimum support and minimum confidence at the same time\ the algorithm output the antibodies revert them to the original values of attribute and interpret rules, but still restore them in the group. If the iteration numbers meet the condition of stop, the algorithm would stop running and output the result Otherwise continue   Extract the vaccines H based on the best antibodies which are generated   Carry out mutation operation for the current group of father A k extract antibody from A k by the probability of Pm, carry out mutation of real number for one or more attributes, randomly make them to others values of attributes by some probability Carry out crossover operation for the current group B k in this paper we adopt discrete recombination rule. Delete the antibodies which do not meet the condition of support   Carry out the operation of vaccination based on the best vaccines which are extracted   Take the criterion of Metropolis selection for the antibodies which have been inoculated, if the fitness of offspring is better than the parent generation, it will enter into the next generation instead of the parent. If the fitness of offspring is smaller than the parent generation, this group enter into the next group by the probability P t of the formula \(1\hen transferre to step two IV  T HE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT  In this paper, according to one thousand record datas of transaction of customers which are extracted in e-shopping we conduct the corresponding mining of association rules and discover the habit of customers who used to buy goods by using MIA For some basic informations of customers and the names of commodities \(that is, the fields of database\uch as the customer's age, occupation, income and the category of the electronic commodity and so on, we express them by means of the real-code. Some values of the attributes  are encoded in the following table 1 In the experiment the parameters of algorithm are: the initial group is 50, the numbers of iteration are 100 times the mutation probability Pm is 0.3, the crossover probability Pc is 0.5; The parameter Tk in the Metropolis selection meets the formula: Tk= ln[T 0 k w h e re T 0 100\ the threshold of confidence is 70%, the threshold of support is 4%.

These rules meet the actual conditions, thus show that this algorithm is effective and feasible when used in the association rules mining V  C ONCLUSION  In this paper we propose an improved immune algorithm\(that is, MIA\ through combining with the character of the simulated annealing mechanism. Compared with traditional IA, through theoretical analysis and the result of experiment, MIA can further solve the degenerate phenomenon of the current algorithm and improve the speed of convergence after introducing the Metropolis criterion Then we try to use this algorithm to excavate association rules, propose a new algorithm of association rule mining Through theoretical analysis and experimental results we can verify that the algorithm is feasible and effective A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province No: F2006000658 and National Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province No F2008000752 R EFERENCES  1  Agrawal R, Imiclinski T, Swami A, Database Mining: A performance perspective.

From Table IV, we attempt to relate the links between the association rules in Table III. From two tables, we gain knowledge that is displayed in Fig. 1. From that figure, it showed only four clusters. This is because in the 30 association rules, association only occurred in C0, C1, C2 and C5. In C3 and C4, association does not happen between the objects Figure 1 Association and clustering between attributes V C ONCLUSIONS In manufacturing the environments, numerous factors contribute to the productivity. These factors such as the personnel, machine capacity or material are conditionally dependent on one another. Due to this, the data mining techniques can be applied on manufacturing data to assist the manufacturer in getting an interesting and valuable knowledge. In this paper, we used the Apriori algorithm to obtain association rules and predict when the most frequent production occurs in the plastic company. Also, we use the k-means algorithm to uncover the link between the observed frequent patterns. From the experiments, we obtained the association prediction model and found two most produced products, i.e. housing and retaining ring. Also, week 19 and week 33 are the frequent weeks  so it can be concluded that the production is massive in week 19 and week 33 Further analysis can be done using other techniques in association rules or clustering. Data in manufacturing possess the characteristics of imbalance and fluctuate. This will be an interesting challenge to the data mining researchers to obtain interesting and valuable information This study can also be viewed from other angle to solve another issue that might be raised in the plastic industry such as the cycle time production, capacity, maintenance or quality control R EFERENCES 1 Hi ll T   L e w i c k i P   20 10 I n t r odu ct i o n  t o  d a t a m i ni n g    STATISTICA Data Mining. http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/datamining-techniques/ [06 June 2  2  Rav iw o n g s e  R  A l l a da V   S a nd idg e J r  T   20 0 0  P l as t i c  Manufacturing Process Selection Methodology Using SelfOrganising Map \(SOM\/Fuzzy Analysis Int.

with the Alignment and NQueens benchmarks Results are similar with both versions Although a deeper analysis will be needed the results suggest two main hypothesis 017 The Intel Compiler does not implement thread switching and thus untied tasks cannot bene\002t from this feature which should avoid imbalances This is particularly evident in the Alignment benchmark which has been reported to scale 017 Task scheduling constraints do not seem to impact signi\002cantly the performance results at most there is a 4 difference between the versions The other applications show a similar behavior D Other opportunities for analysis The Intel Compiler does not implement mechanisms that allow the user choose among different task scheduling policies but other OpenMP compilers e 16 that have such capabilities One interesting study is to 002nd how task scheduling policies and how they can mantain locality across tasks can affect the performance results of the benchmarks of the suite In previous sections we have discussed how implementing a cut-off mechanism can affect application performance but we have not discussed due to space limitations how the different cut-off values i.e at which point in the recursion we cut relate with the creation of parallelism and the overall performance Choosing a low cut-off value can restrict parallelism opportunities but choosing a high cut-off value can saturate the system with a large amount of tasks which have no thread available to execute them The right choice depends many times of the input data set Comparing the application behaviour using different cut-off values or testing runtime features which allow to modify dynamically the cut-off can also be interesting analyses The quality of implementations for different task generation schemes e.g in the SparseLU benchmark which can use a single or multiple generator scheme taskwait constructs or other task related implementation details could also be analyzed with our benchmark suite proposal V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE WORK We have presented BOTS  Barcelona OpenMP Task Suite  built with the double motivation of coping with the great characteristics of the multicore processors and offer a set of benchmarks to evaluate OpenMP tasking We think that BOTS will help implementors and programmers to have a better understanding of the OpenMP tasking model and its performance implications Each of these benchmarks comes also with different versions to test different aspects of the tasking model For example they can be used to evaluate task scheduling alternatives tiedness   Also a number of input sets are provided so that benchmarks can be used as tests or really stress the processors and memory system in your machine It is interesting to note that we have tried to select benchmarks with diverse characteristics In this paper we have highlighted the differences and we have shown their evaluation on an SGI Altix machine with up to 32 processors and we report some of their characteristics per task e.g operations memory writes    Their evaluation also shows that there is plenty of work to do at all levels  architecture compiler runtime system programming model to improve certain benchmarks given that their current scalability is very limited This suite can be used to obtain useful data of the strenghts and weaknesses of an OpenMP implementation that can help developers to improve it Currently we are working to add new benchmarks to the suite to cover more problem domains and scenarios We are as well planning to do a full cross-vendor evaluation to 002nd which is the current state of the OpenMP tasking implementations A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation contracts no TIN2007-60625 and CSD2007-00050 the European Commission in the context of the SARC project contract no 27648 the HiPEAC Network of Excellence contract no IST-004408 the IBM CAS Program and the Mare Incognito project under the BSC-IBM collaboration agreement R EFERENCES  O ARB OpenMP Applicati on Program Interf ace v  3.0  May 2008  J M Bull Measuring Synchronizati on and Scheduling Ov er heads in OpenMP in First European Workshop on OpenMP  September 1999  LLNL OpenMP Performance Suite Description 2001 A v ailable https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/RTS Report/openmp perf.html  A Dorta C Rodriguez F  de Sande and A Gonzalez The OpenMP Source Code Repository Euromicro Conference on Parallel Distributed and Network-Based Processing  vol 0 pp 244–250 2005  C Bienia S K umar  J P  Singh and K Li The P ARSEC Benchmark Suite Characterization and Architectural Implications in Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques  2008 pp 72–81  H Jin M Frumkin and J Y an The OpenMP Implementation of NAS Parallel Benchmarks and Its Performance NASA Ames Research Center Technical Report NAS-99-011 1999 A v ailable citeseer.ist.psu.edu/408248.html
