data mining association rules Apriori algorithm football match I INTRODUCTION With the increasing development of information technology and the continued large-scale of the data scale various professions the data mining technology is unceasingly mature and develops gradually to the domain application direction Data mining is a kind of technology which extracts the non-ordinary implicit unknown potentially useful information from the large-scale data 1 As the continuous development of the cause of the sports information the sports field has accumulated large amounts of data so it will become 
Index Terms 
a trend that data mining is applied to the data analysis in sports field especially competitive and adversarial sports Data mining's analysis methods are various such as association rule mining and clustering analysis In this paper association rule mining as well as the improved Apriori algorithm are used to analyze the technology movements in football games The correlation between movements therefore can be obtained so that the rate of shoot goals for the players will be enhanced which will provide a scientific basis for the training II ASSOCIA TION RULES AND ApRIORI ALGORITHM Association rules which reflect the mutual dependency and the relatedness between matters are an important highly active 
area of data mining The extraction of association rules is to dig out the interesting association or correlation between the item sets in a large number of data Apriori algorithm is the classical algorithm of the model in association rules and it is the improved algorithm introduced by R Agrawal et al in 1994 which is based on AIS algorithm Apriori algorithm uses a technology called floor by floor search of the iterative method of which the basic idea is to use recursive layer by layer approach First scan the database resulting in frequent item sets and then Apriori-gen makes use of the connection of the members of L k 1 to produce candidates 
for frequent item sets Ck especially after the members being pruned The supported numbers of each candidate frequent item sets 978-1-4244-4543-1/09/$25.00 2512009 IEEE 178 Lina Wang No.2 middle school of Handan city Handan China wanglinaenglish 126.com thereby can be calculated by scanning the transaction database According to the comparison with the user-specified minimum supports the item sets which are greater than the minimum supports are combined into K number of frequent item sets L 
The algorithm shall be carried on until no candidate frequent item sets are generated As a result all the frequent item sets are combined The biggest advantage of the Apriori 
k 225 
algorithm is that algorithm's idea is relatively simple which is based on recursive statistic generating frequent item sets Although it is easy to implement the Apriori algorithm itself has a number of disadvantages such as 1 Multiple scan of the transaction database will come into being When a large number of transactional data are stored in the database each scan time will be very long In this way their efficiency will be very low 2 A large number of candidate item sets will be produced The k-1 candidate sets produced by L k 1 are presenting exponential growth III ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM A matrix representation of the database is given the methods 
of which are following item sets are arranged in sequence and transaction sets are also ranked in order Item sets stand for row vector while the panel stands for column vector If the 
i i 
column in the matrix is 1 otherwise it is 0 which will be accordingly called Boolean matrix of the database As is known from the analysis anyone transaction needs scanning only one time and then a Boolean matrix 4 corresponding to the database can be gotten For the inadequacies of Apriori algorithm this paper adopts Association Rules of 
item set is in the affairs then the value of the row and the 
Boolean Matrix Algorithm Association Rules Algorithm Based on Boolean Matrix abbrev ARABBM and gives the basic design ideas and description of the algorithm Compared with the classical algorithm the algorithm only scans the database once to accelerate the speed of scanning the frequent item sets Boolean matrix is a good data representation ARABBM algorithm transmits the transaction database into a Boolean matrix form and then stores in bits and finally saves a lot of memory space frequent item sets instead of candidate item sets are directly generated by Boolean algorithm Therefore on one hand bottlenecks problems of iteratively producing PElTS 2009

CAN algorithm  Figure 6. Collaborative Filtering Method Tree Traditional CF is most simple recommendation algorithm which only adapt to situation where all recommended items belong to alone interest title or do main. If the condition can not be satisfied, CFC algorithm is considered. But only when rating is enough dense, community neighborhood of every user in each community can be determined. Otherwise, CFC based on pre-filling is used. Although there are many prefilling method, generally, PUC is suggested to be exploited But if there is no enough data, VPF and HPV are alternative In order to use CFC-PUC, rating data should be enough dense so rating of each user-community can be computed, otherwise CAN should be performed. The flow chart of various methods is shown in Figure 7  Figure 7.  Collaborative Filtering Method Flowing Chart In the following, various methods are evaluated through experiments  VII  EXPERIMENT  EVALUATION A  Dataset Datasets employed in our experiment are from EachMovie  collaborative filtering service. The EachMovie service was part of a research project at the Systems Research Center of Digital Equipment Corporation. The service was available for a period of 18 months and was shut down in September 1997 During that time the database grew to a fairly large size containing ratings from 72,916 users on 1,628 movies. User ratings were recorded on a numeric six-point scale \(0.0, 0.2 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0\The data set is publicly available and can be obtained from Digital Equipment Corporation  Although the data from 72,916 users is available, we restrict the analysis to the 450 users in the database. These 450 users provided ratings for 300 different movies. In order to test the performance of various algorithms under different conditions Dense or Sparse\ets used in our experiment are grouped into group A and group B. Dataset in group A is denseness dataset in which users have more ratings, and dataset in group B is sparse dataset in which user have little ratings. Datasets in group A are named according to its number of users. Altogether, five datasets is used in our experiment, respectively as A50, A150, A250, A350, A450 in which users respectively are the top 50, 150, 250, 350, 450 users that have the most ratings. Datasets in group B consist of ratings of top 50 150 250 350 450 user by userID for top 250 movies. They are dataset B50 B150 B250 B350 B450. Dataset in group B have heavy sparsity comparing with datasets in group A Y Y Y N N N  Community neighborhood of user for a community can not be determined Rating of use r communit y can not be computed for sparse ratings of user-item There exist multi-interest or multi-domain CAN CF CFC CFC-PUC CF CFC CFC-VPF CFC-PUC CAN CFC-HPF

So, 10 experiments are made for each datasets, in where, the best result is used to analyze in the following. For each experiment Top-N recommendation tactics is exploited, and number of recommended movie is fixed as 30 for comparing the performance of various algorithms In the algorithm CAN, movie communities in dataset Eachmovie are determined according to the type of movie provided by dataset. So, there are ten movie communities in our experiment, respectively Action, Animation, Art_Foreign Classic, Comedy, Drama, Family, Horror, Romance, and Thriller Mean Absolute Error MAE\ween ratings and predictions is a widely used metric. It is exploited in our experiment  N q p MAE N i i i     1  In the experiment, Climentine11.0 is used in association rule and Delphi is used to write other part code in all algorithms The algorithm proceeding is run in IBM T60 PC Note 0.120 0.140 0.160 0.180 0.200 0.220 0.240 A50 A150 A250 A350 A450 Dens e DataSet MAE CAN CFC-P UC CFC-VP F CFC-HP F CFC CF  Figure 8.

Comparing of Performance under sparse dataset C  Experiment Result In this section, several findings though experiment are given. Detail experiment result is shown in Figure 8 and 9 First, it is shown in Figure 8 and 9 that all five methods based on community, CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF, CFC-HPV and CFC respectively, generally achieve better performance than CF. It is explained that there exist general neighborhood problem in traditional co llaborative filtering and that community neighborhood is effective to overcome the general neighborhood in CF.  It is noticed that CFC has no advantage over CF, especially under sparsity. As shown in Figure 9, CFC show worse performance than CF. It is explained that CFC suffers from severer sparsity than CF. It tells us that simply considering community in collaborative filtering is not always good strategy Secondly, as shown in Figure 8 and 9, generally, four CFC methods based on pre-filling, CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV respectively, have advantage over CFC, especially under sparsity situation. By comparing Figure 8 with Figure 9 advantage of CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV over CFC is more obvious under sparse data \(Figure 9\an under dense data \(Figure 8\It is explained that CFC could suffer from severe sparsity, and pre-filling based on community is help for overcoming the sparsity Thirdly, it is noticed that CFC-PUC generally has better performance than CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV.  It is shown that pre-filling based on user-community is better selecting Finally, it also is shown in Figure 8 and 9 that CAN generally achieve better performance than CFC-PUC. It is explained that it is not enough to pre-fill simply based on usercommunity because it is possible that certain user-community could be null, and pre-filling could not succeed. In fact, it is discovered that CAN has more obvious advantage over CFCPUC under sparse data than under dense data VIII  CONCLUSION Recommender systems are a powerful new technology for extracting additional value for a business from its user databases. Collaborative filtering is the most important 


method widely used in recommender systems. In this paper starting from general neighborhood problem, various methods are proposed and a complete collaborative filtering method system is build. Also, various methods are compared empirically each other. Although experiments elementally support our ideas, it is still need more experiments to verify them with more dataset in the future. More research need to be made to enhance CFC by other methods, such as ontology A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was partly supported by National Science Foundation of China under grants No.70871115, \(Renmin University of China\C Publishing Plan for International Journal under grants No.10XNK090.

We can see that the positive effect of genetic lateral tuning became weaker as became larger for the low imbalance data sets. On the other hand, the approaches with candidate rule addition and ge netic lateral tuning \(i.e., EC and ECW*\kept good ranking in almost all cases. This observation may indicate that the proposed extensions are effective especially for the high imbalanced data sets V   C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed two extensions of our genetic fuzzy rule selection for designi ng more accurate classifiers One extension is to add compatible rules with misclassified patterns into candidate rules for genetic fuzzy rule selection The other extension is to tune membership functions by genetic lateral tuning after genetic fuzzy rule selection Experimental results showed that the candidate rule addition can improve the training data accuracy. This is because the possibility that the misclassified training patterns are classified by additional rules becomes high. Experimental results also showed that the genetic lateral tuning can improve the test data accuracy as well as the training data accuracy, since fuzzy membersh ip functions are properly adjusted according to the pattern distributions. The combination of the proposed two extensions would be the best choice As a future study, we will examine the effects of the proposed extensions using a large number of data sets TABLE  VI A DJUSTED P VALUES OBTAINED BY N EMENYI 222 S T EST   H OLM 222 S T EST   S HAFFER 222 S T EST  AND B ERGMANN H OMMEL P ROCEDURE FOR THE T EST D ATA A CCURACY OBTAINED IN OUR C OMPUTATIONAL E XPERIMENTS  i Hypothesis Unadjusted p  p Neme  p Holm  p Shaf  p Berg  1 Pareto vs. ECW 3.1 x 10 10 4.8 x 10 9 4.8 x 10 9 4.8 x 10 9 4.9 x 10 9  2 Pareto vs. EC 1.6 x 10 7 2.4 x 10 6 2.2 x 10 6 1.6 x 10 6 1.6 x 10 6  3 EC vs. ECW 1.6 x 10 4 0.0024 0.0021 0.0016 0.0016 4 Pareto vs. ECW 8.0 x 10 4 0.0119 0.0095 0.0080 0.0056 5 Pareto* vs. ECW 0.0012 0.0173 0 0127 0.0116 0.0081 6 Pareto vs. Pareto 0.0024 0.0355 0 0237 0.0237 0.0142 7 ECW vs. ECW 0 0033 0.0500 0.0300 0.0237 0.0142 8 EC vs. EC 0.0064 0.0963 0.0514 0.0449 0.0385 9 Pareto vs. EC 0 0119 0.1781 0.0831 0.0831 0.0475 10 Pareto* vs. EC 0 0277 0.4156 0.1662 0.1662 0.0831 11 ECW vs. EC 0.0592 0.8876 0.2959 0.2367 0.1183 12 EC* vs. ECW 0 2945 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 13 EC vs. ECW 0.4017 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 14 EC vs. Pareto 0 6002 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 15 ECW vs. Pareto 0 7532 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 


   including data sets with more than two classes. We also have to compare the proposed method with other learning algorithms. There are still a lot of things we have to improve in the proposed extensions, es pecially the search space and genetic operations in the lateral tuning. The discussion on the tradeoff relation among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability is also another important future research issue  Pareto EC ECW Pareto EC ECW  0.00 0.01 0.05 0.10 0 2 4 6 Average rank  Fig. 9.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
