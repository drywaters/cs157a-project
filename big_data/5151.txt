In recent years the quantity of teletrafìc is rapidly growing because of the explosive increase of Internet users and its applications The needs of collection storage management analysis and measurement of the subsequent teletrafìc have been emerged as one of very important issues So far many studies for detecting anomaly teletrafìc have been done However measurement and analysis studies for big data in cloud computing environments are not actively being made based on Hadoop Thus this paper presents for detecting anomaly teletrafìc using stochastic self-similarity based on Hadoop All simulations are conducted under control of our proposed platform called AT M 
tool for anomaly teletrafìc intrusion detection system on Hadoop Our numerical results show that the values of the estimated Hurst parameter obtained from the anomaly teletrafìc are much higher when compared to ordinary local area network trafìc Keywords Anomaly teletrafìc detection stochastic selfsimilarity Hurst parameter Hadoop big data cloud computing I I NTRODUCTION The number of users of the Internet and mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets has increased greatly in recent years They could lead to the explosive growth of the amount of teletrafìc Resulting in exponentially growing 
amount of data big data era that these data become an economic asset has arrived there In order to successfully and effectively use of big data in information and communication education health care and nancial services we need to consider three major components resources technology for data processing and analysis and experts who gain an insight into the meaning of the data We focus on the second element of the data processing and analysis technology to detect anomaly teletrafìc using stochastic similarity on our proposed Hadoop-based platform Hadoop is basically a large scaled data processing system operated by a distributed computing platform in which 
distrib ution is a core frame concept 1 Hence Hadoop efìciently enriches data storage spaces and computation capability based on parallel processing and it can enable implementation of the MapReduce programming model for cloud computing The core fraction of Hadoop is a distributed le system Meanwhile the explosive growth of teletrafìc for user services threatens the current networks and we face menaces from various kinds of intrusive incidents through the Internet A variety of network attacks on network resources such as DDoS Distributed Denial of Service and PDoS Permanent DoS have continuously made serious damage 3  Therefore acti v e and adv anced technologies for early 
detecting of anomaly teletrafìc on Hadoop-based platforms should be understood In this paper we have developed an automated A nomaly T eletrafìc detection M easurement analysis tool called AT M tool Some problems and solutions for those systems have been also suggested All simulations were executed under control of the AT M tool to investigate how input anomaly teletrafìc with DDoS attacks can be different from ordinary local area network LAN trafìc The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section

Figure 1 Hadoop architecture Hadoop Distributed File System and the distributed processing MapReduce Hadoop increases the storage space and the processing power by uniting many computers into one A small Hadoop cluster will include a single master and multiple worker nodes slaves as in Figure 1 The master node consists of a Job Tracker TaskTracker NameNode and DataNode A slave or worker node acts as both a DataNode and TaskTracker In a large cluster HDFS is managed through a dedicated NameNode server to host the le system index and a secondary NameNode that can generate snapshots of the NameNodeês memory structures thus preventing le system corruption and reducing loss of data 1 Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS is a distributed scalable and portable le system written in Java for the Hadoop framework Each node in a Hadoop instance typically has a single DataNode A cluster of DataNodes form the HDFS cluster that has a NameNode in a role of metadata server A NameNode performs various utilities of the le system namespace such as open close rename and etc for les and directories A le is divided into more than a block that is stored in a DataNode and HDFS determines mapping between DataNodes and blocks DataNodes run operations such as read and write that le system clients require Since HDFS is written in Java any Java-operating computers run NameNode or DataNode software which saves the huge cost at the hardware architect phase and the management phase HDFS is a common le system in Hadoop but is not the only le system For example Elastic Computer Cloud EC2 of Amazone uses S3 its own le system instead of HDFS Brisk of DataStax uses Cassandra File System that includes data query and analytic functions for integration of real-time data storage and analysis 2 MapReduce MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data multi-terabyte data-sets in-parallel on large clusters thousands of nodes of commodity hardware in a reliable fault-tolerant manner Above the le systems come the MapReduce engine which consists of one JobTracker to which client applications submit MapReduce jobs The JobTracker pushes work out to available TaskTracker nodes in the cluster striving to keep the work as close to the data as possible With a rack-aware le system the JobTracker knows which node contains the data and which other machines are nearby If the work cannot be hosted on the actual node where the data resides priority is given to nodes in the same rack This reduces network trafìc on the main backbone network If a TaskTracker fails or times out that part of the job is rescheduled The TaskTracker on each node spawns off a separate Java Virtual Machine process to prevent the TaskTracker itself from failing if the running job crashes the JVM A heartbeat is sent from the TaskTracker to the JobTracker every few minutes to check its status The Job Tracker and TaskTracker status and information is exposed by Jetty and can be viewed from a web browser A limitation of Hadoop is that it cannot be directly mounted to an existing operating system Getting data into and out of the HDFS le system an action that often needs to be performed before and after executing a job can be inconvenient Another limitation is that Hadoop is not efìcient for sub-second data reports and frequent data changes Hadoop is less effective than RDBMS where frequent data insertion deletion and update occur and the complete multi-step transaction is used for data processing An advantage of Hadoop is scalability which Yahoo and Facebook show very well Another advantage is costeffectiveness A lot of data cause an intensive amount of RDBMS data storage by keeping raw data in isolation Hadoop considers the signiìcance of raw data and processed data equally B Anomaly Teletrafìc Intrusion Detection System An Intrusion Detection System IDS is a security tool and the goal is to strengthen the security of information and communication systems by monitoring network or system activities identifying intrusions and making reports  9 In terms of analysis technologies IDSes can be classiìed into two types Signature-based Teletrafìc Intrusion Detection System ST-IDS 1 and Anomaly-based Teletrafìc Intrusion Detection System AT-IDS ST-IDSes apply patterns of known attacks to nd attacks For this approach it is necessary to build a signature database expressing known attacks in advance However ST-IDSes 1 ST-IDS is also called as Misuse-based Teletrafìc Intrusion Detection System

Figure 2 Techniques for anomaly teletrafìc intrusion detection are not effective against new or unknown attacks in spite of their efìciency On the other hand AT-IDSes decide if an attack happens by checking if the deviation between a given event and the normal behavior is greater than a predeìned threshold It is worthwhile to note that this approach can detect previously unseen attacks In considering the characteristics of the Hadoop framework we focus on the AT-IDS approach for its security in this paper Anomaly detection technologies in Figure 2 can be categorized into three types statistical-based knowledgebased and machine learning-based approaches First the statistical-based approach obtains the system or network trafìc activity and then generates a proìle corresponding to its stochastic behavior Through this proìle observed events are checked by the deviation between their behavior and the normal one This approach involves univariate multivariate time series and self-similar models Second in the knowledge-based approach audited events are classiìed based on the pre-deìned rules such as knowledge This approach includes nite state machines description languages and expert systems Finally the last approach including Markov models genetic algorithms neural networks Bayesian networks fussy logic and clustering and outlier detection applies the machine learning method to detect attacks Figure 2 and Table I show the three approaches and their related technologies For details also see III S ELF SIMILAR S TOCHASTIC P ROCESSES Self-similar or fractal long-range dependent stochastic processes occur in many natural and man-made systems In particular since such processes were discovered in the Internet and other multimedia telecommunication networks more than a decade ago 11 the y h a v e become the subject of numerous research investigations of their nature and consequences A Deìnitions of Self-similar Stochastic Processes Theoretically one can distinguish two types of stochastic self-similarity A continuous-time stochastic process Y t   Y t 1 Y t 2   is strictly self-similar with Hurst parameter  H 0  5 H 1 if Y ct and c H Y t the rescaled process with time scale ct  have identical nite-dimensional distribution for any stretching factor c  c 0  13  This means that for an y sequence of time points t 1 t 2 t n   Y ct 1 Y ct 2 Y ct n  d   c H Y t 1 c H Y t 2 c H Y t n   1 where d  denotes equivalence in distribution Thus a strictly self-similar process or self-similar in a narrow sense is self-similar in the sense of probability distribution Weak self-similarity of stochastic processes or selfsimilarity in a broad sense becomes relevant when one restricts analysis of stochastic processes to their rst two moments only  i.e to their means variances and covariances Because of that it is also known as second-order self-similarity For example let a sequence  X 1 X 2   be a time-stationary stochastic process deìned at discrete time instances i 1  2  3   Let E  X i  EX  Var  X i  VarX  and  k  E  X i  EX   X i  k  EX  V arX denote its mean variance and autocorrelation coefìcient of lag k respectively Having grouped this sequence of random variables into batches of size m  m  1  we can deìne the aggregated process of X  m    X  m  1 X  m  2    at a given aggregation level m  where X  m  i  1  m  X im  m 1    X im  i  1  If  X 1 X 2   is a weakly self-similar time-stationary process with 0  5 H 1  then Var  X  m  i  m 2 H  2 VarX 2 and   m  k   k k  0  3 where   m  k is the autocorrelation coefìcient of lag k of the aggregated process X  m   Equation 3 means that the original process and its aggregated version have an identical correlation structure Further it can be proved that in any weakly self-similar process with 0  5 H 1   k  H 2 H  1 k 2 H  2  4 as k   and k    k    k    5 see for example Thus the autocorrelation function decays very slowly hyperbolically with k  Because of these properties these processes are also known as long-range dependent  or strongly correlated The Hurst parameter H  known as the self-similarity parameter  is the simplest numerical characteristic of stochastic

detect anomaly teletrafìc in an LAN environment collector storage analyzer and graphic user interface GUI The AT M tool was implemented in Java and has been tested at Korean Bible University under the 64-bit Windows 7 1 Collector module collects web page data SNS data and system log data from SNS open API e.g Facebook Twitter distributed le collection tools data collection robots and data aggregators 2 Storage module is used to store and manage big data in le storages data storages and structured data storages through lters and real-time analysis 3 Analyzer module analyzes clusters and classiìes parallel and distributed data This module also plays an important role in contents analysis descriptive analysis predictive analysis natural language processing text mining etc Especially AT-IDS is implemented to detect anomaly teletrafìc using the MapReduce framework 4 GUI module provides automated statistical analysis of results such as starting and monitoring the system obtaining information about real-time status of the system and real-time statistics for AT-IDS V N UMERICAL R ESULTS All simulations were executed under control of the AT M tool to investigate how input anomaly teletrafìc with DDoS attacks can be different from ordinary LAN trafìc The AT M tool was used to generate collect and analyze tenhour long data including ordinary LAN and anomaly trafìc The estimates of the Hurst parameter obtained from the R/S-statistic and the Abry-Veitch DWB were used to analyze LAN and anomaly trafìc  The plot of R/S-statistic in Fig 4 b indicates the asymptotic slope approximates to slope 1 but the slope of the R/S-statistic in Fig 4 a obtained from the LAN trafìc is lower than Fig 4 b The estimated Hurst parameters of Fig 4 b and a obtained from the R/Sstatistic plot were 0.9014 and 0.8984 respectively  The Abry-Veitch DWB estimator provides both an estimated Hurst parameter and a conìdence interval The results for LAN and anomaly trafìc obtained from Abry-Veitch DWB estimator were 0.919 0.889 and 1.248 1.218 2  respectively also see Fig 5 Our numerical results showed that the value of the estimated Hurst parameter for anomaly trafìc is 35.8 higher than LAN Therefore our numerical results for anomaly trafìc showed that the values of the estimated Hurst parameter 2 First note that  k 1  2 k 2 H g  k  1   where g  x 1 x  2 H  2+\(1  x  2 H For H 1  g  k  1  diverges to inìnity This contradicts the fact that  k must be between 1 and 1 F o r anomaly traf c with DDoS attacks the Abry-Veitch DWB estimator over all other scales shows an unexpected slope of the estimated Hurst parameter of H  1.248 because of the discontinuity signature and the missing scales phenomenon It is not even consistent with stationarity For detailed discussion also see obtained from the different estimation techniques were much higher when compared to LAN trafìc VI C ONCLUSIONS The massive volume of data called big data for user services threatens the current networks and we have faced menaces from various kinds of intrusive incidents through the Internet A variety of network attacks on network resources have continuously created serious damage Therefore active and advanced technologies for early detecting of anomaly teletrafìc on a Hadoop-based platform are required In this paper we proposed an automated anomaly teletrafìc measurement analysis tool called AT M  and some problems and solutions for this system have been also investigated Our numerical results showed that the values of the estimated Hurst parameter obtained from the anomaly teletrafìc are much higher when compared to ordinary LAN trafìc A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to give thanks to the funding agencies for providing nancial support Parts of this work were

C ONCLUSION  In this paper we propose a new text document clustering algorithm named STC-NER, which stands for Suffix Tree Clustering with Named Entity Recognition. This algorithm is supposed to cluster news reports written in Chinese returned from news search engine. Due to the characteristics of news reports, we import the method of entities extraction by means of named entity recognition into the document preprocessing This helps to reduce the high dimension of the documents by reducing the number of key words. After the preprocessing number of nodes in the suffix tree model decreases, which makes the algorithm more effective As the STC algorithm was proposed for clustering English documents, we adapt Chinese words segmentation to make the algorithm suitable for Chinese do cuments as well. The Chinese words segmentation is accomplished with the open source tool NLPIR. In this way all documents written in Chinese are also treated as strings and they are appropriate for the STC algorithm We also proposed a new structure for the suffix tree model by moving labels of the string from edges to the nodes. Each node is a storage unit, together with all the necessary information like document index numbers, start point of substrings, child node pointer and so on. This facilitates the traversing and operation of the algorithm During the experiments, we found that the threshold is appropriate to conduct the document clustering. We used two groups of data sets to conduct the experiments. We can see from the results that our STC-NER algorithm gets better performance than conventional STC algorithm in both precision and efficiency when clustering news searching results returned by the search engines ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by National 863 Program No. 2011AA01A204\, P.

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
