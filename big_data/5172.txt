was proposed in and used in 15 W e use the FURS technique for training and validation set selection For large scale networks the training data comprises the adjacency list of all the nodes v i i 1 N tr  Let the training set of nodes be represented by V tr and the training set cardinality be N tr  The validation and test set of nodes are represented by V valid and V test respectively The cardinality of these sets are N valid and N test respectively These sets of adjacency lists can efìciently be stored in the memory as real world networks are highly sparse and there are limited connections for each node v i  V tr  The maximum length of the adjacency list can be equal to N  This is the case when a node is connected to all the other nodes in a network A Model Building and overcoming any kernel parameters For V tr training nodes D   x i  N tr i 1  such that x i  R N  Given D and a user-deìned k maximum number of clusters in the network the primal formulation of the weighted kernel PCA is gi v e n by min w  l  e  l  b l 1  2 k  1  l 1 w  l   w  l   1 2 N tr k  1  l 1  l e  l   D  1  e  l  such that e  l   w  l   b l 1 N tr l 1 k  1 1 where e  l   e  l  1 e  l  N tr   are the projections onto the eigenspace l 1 k  1 indicates the number of score variables required to encode the k communities D  1   R N tr  N tr is the inverse of the degree matrix associated to the kernel matrix    is the N tr  d h feature matrix     x 1        x N tr    and  l  R  are the regularization constants We note that N tr  N i.e the number of nodes in the training set is much less than the total number of nodes in the large scale network The kernel matrix  is obtained by calculating the similarity between the adjacency list of each pair of nodes in the training set Each element of   denoted as  ij  K  x i x j    x i     x j  is obtained by calculating the cosine similarity between the adjacency lists x i and x j which has been shown to be an effective similarity measure for large scale data Thus  ij  x  i x j  x i  x j  can be calculated efìciently using notions of set unions and intersections This corresponds to using a normalized linear kernel function K  x z  x  z  x  z   The clustering model is then represented by e  l  i  w  l     x i  b l i 1 N tr 2 where   R N  R d h is the mapping to a high-dimensional feature space d h  b l are the bias terms l 1 k  1  However for large scale networks we can utilize the explicit expression of the underlying feature map and d h  N  Since the KSC formulation is valid for any positive deìnite kernel we use a normalized linear kernel function to avoid any kernel parameter The projections e  l  i represent the latent variables of a set of k  1 binary cluster indicators given by sign e  l  i  which can be combined with the nal groups using an encoding/decoding scheme The dual problem corresponding to this primal formulation is D  1  M D    l    l   l  3 where M D  I N tr  1 N tr 1  N tr D  1   1  N tr D  1  1 N tr   The   l  are the dual variables and the kernel function K  R N  R N  R plays the role of similarity function B Encoding/Decoding Scheme Ideally when the communities are non-overlapping we will obtain k well separated clusters and the normalized Laplacian has k piece-wise constant eigenvectors This is because the multiplicity of the largest eigenvalue i.e 1 is k as depicted in In case of KSC due to the centering matrix M D the eigenvectors have zero mean and the optimal threshold for binarizing the eigenvectors is self-determined equal to 0  So we need k 1 eigenvectors In the eigenspace every cluster A p  p 1 k is a point and is represented with a unique codebook c p  1  1  k  1  To obtain this codebook CB   c p  k p 1 we transform the rows of the projected vector matrix obtained from the training data by binarizing it i.e sign e 1   sign e  k  1   The codebook set CB is obtained by selecting the top k most frequent codebook vectors However in real world networks the communities do overlap and we do not have piece-wise constant eigenvectors For the matrix D  1 M D  each eigenvector contains information about binary clustering However using the one versus all encoding scheme the number of score variables needed to encode k clusters is k  1  The decoding scheme consists of comparing the cluster indicators obtained in the validation/test stage with the codebook and selecting the nearest codebook based on Hamming distance This scheme corresponds to the ECOC decoding procedure and is used in out-of-sample extensions as well The out-of-sample extension is based on the score variables which correspond to the projections of the mapped out-of-sample points onto the eigenvectors found in the training stage The cluster indicators can be obtained by binarizing the score variables for the out-of-sample points as sign e  l  test   sign test   l   b l 1 N test  4 where l 1 k  1   test is the N test  N tr kernel matrix evaluated using the test points with entries  r,i  K  x r x i   r 1 N test and i 1 N tr  This natural extension to out-of-sample points is the main advantage of KSC In this way the clustering model can be trained validated and tested in an unsupervised learning procedure For the test set we use the entire network If the network cannot t in memory we divide it into chunks to calculate the cluster memberships for each test chunk in parallel C Model Selection or Estimation of k In the authors proposed a criterion called Balanced Angular Fit  BAF  which tries to estimate the number of clusters using the validation set of nodes The BAF criterion is based on the principle that the nodes which belong to the same cluster have nearly zero or very small angular distance in the eigenspace w.r.t each other in comparison to the nodes belonging to different clusters To determine the number of clusters the end-user provides a maximum possible number of clusters  maxk  The KSC model is built using this maxk i.e 386 


we perform an eigen-decomposition of the D  1 M D  matrix and select the top maxk eigenvectors The BAF criterion is iteratively evaluated for k 2 to k  maxk  1  The value of k for which the BAF is maximum is provided to the end-user as the ideal number of clusters The method works well but requires to iterate over all values of k from 2 to maxk  1  Hence it doesnêt automatically determine the ideal value of k in a few steps Another approach to automatically determine the ideal value of k was proposed in using the structure of the eigenvectors However the underlying assumption is that the eigenvector matrix Z comprises k piece-wise constant eigenvectors and there is at most one non-zero entry in every row Both these assumptions do not hold for the KSC model for real world overlapping networks Algorithm 1 provides a summary of the Original KSC method  Algorithm 1 Original KSC Algorithm Data  Given a graph G  V E   Result  The partitions of the graph G  i.e divide graph into k

removing the subgraph S corresponding to X tr using FURS 4 Calculate the kernel matrix  by applying cosine similarity operations on sparse adjacency lists of  i j v i v j  X tr  5 Perform eigen-decomposition of  to obtain the model i.e   l  b l  6 Use out-of-sample extension property to obtain the projection values for the validation set i.e e  l  valid  7 Use BAF and e  l  valid to estimate the number of clusters k   This is the step which is automated by our proposed approach 8 After estimating k  use the out-of-sample property to assign clusters to unseen test nodes We use the entire network as test data III S ELF T UNED K ERNEL S PECTRAL C LUSTERING In section II-A we have shown that for large scale networks the normalized linear kernel function is sufìcient The only parameter left is the number of clusters to be identiìed  k  We propose a novel technique to determine the number of clusters  k  automatically in a few steps We exploit the projections of the validation nodes in the eigenspace The proposed approach is based on the simple idea that the projections of the validation nodes which belong to the same cluster have very small or nearly zero angular distance from each other in comparison with the nodes belonging to different clusters Before we explain the technique we mention a few prerequisites All the experiments were performed on a single machine with 8 Gb RAM 2.4Ghz Intel I-7 processor The maximum size matrix that can be stored in memory is 5  000  5  000  The training set size is xed as N tr  min\(15 of N  5000 i.e minimum between 15 of the total nodes in the network  N  and 5  000 nodes The subset size of 15 of the nodes in the network is chosen as per experimental analysis in W e set the v alidation set size N valid to be the same as N tr  We put the condition that minimum size of a cluster is M inCsize  max\(0  01 of N valid  5 i.e maximum between 0  01 of the number of nodes in the validation set and 5 nodes Since for estimation of the number of clusters we use the validation set we put the minimum size constraint on the validation set This constraint is to prevent the selection of outlier groups of small size as a cluster Thus suppose the training set size is 5  000 nodes then the minimum size of cluster has to be 5  The maxk value is determined as  N tr M inCsize   Thus if the minimum size of the cluster is 5 and maximum size of the validation set is 5  000 then the maximum number of clusters that can be detected is 1  000  The runtime complexity of KSC approach is O  N 3 tr  O  N tr  N test   However testing can be done in parallel and the second term in time complexity can be reduced signiìcantly A Identifying the number of clusters We obtain the projection of the validation nodes v j  V valid in the eigenspace using the out-of-sample extension and binarize the score variables as follows sign e  l  valid   sign valid   l   b l 1 N valid  5 Let the latent variable matrix be represented as E  The size of the this matrix is N valid   maxk  1  The matrix E is deìned as  e 1 e N valid    We then create a new symmetric afìnity matrix A from the latent variable matrix E  Since we already stated that the maximum size of the validation set is 5  000 nodes the maximum size of the A matrix is 5  000  5  000  The afìnity matrix is build using cosine distance as A  i j  CosDist  e i e j   cos e i e j   e  i e j  e i  e j  The CosDist  function can take values between 0  2 We use the concept that nodes which belong to the same community have smaller or nearly zero angular distance w.r.t the nodes within the community and more angular distance w.r.t nodes belonging to different communities Thus the nodes which belong to the same cluster will have very small or nearly zero CosDist  e i e j    i j in the same cluster Figure 1 highlights this idea on a synthetic network of 1  000 nodes generated by the software proposed in with mixing parameter  0  1  The mixing parameter implies the extent of overlap in the communities with smaller values representing less overlap In Figure 1a we obtain the projections of the validation nodes in 2 dimensional space as we set maxk  3 for the purpose of visualization Figure 1b showcases the presence of a block diagonal structure for the afìnity matrix A  To obtain this block diagonal matrix we used the groundtruth cluster memberships for the validation set of nodes We then sort the validation nodes using the groundtruth information on 387 


a Validation node projections b Afìnity matrix A w.r.t groundtruth Fig 1 First two steps for identifying the number of clusters in a given network the basis of their cluster afìliation and construct the afìnity matrix A  The black shaded regions represent the part of the afìnity matrix where the CosDist  e i e j  values are zero and nearly equal to zero The aim is to identify the number of such block diagonals which determine the number of clusters k in the given network Real world networks have overlapping communities However the extent of overlap in these communities is not known beforehand Also the groundtruth is not available in most real world large scale networks Thus the afìnity matrix A  though contains a block-diagonal structure need not necessarily be ordered in block-diagonal format We observe from Figure 1a that projection of nodes which belong to the same cluster do not necessarily have zero angular distance due to presence of overlap But the angle between two projection vectors say e i and e j belonging to the p th cluster  C p  is mostly less than 90  leading to 0  cos e i e j   1  After little algebraic manipulation we obtain that 0  CosDist  e i e j   1 for two nodes i and j belonging to cluster p  C p  Since the extent of overlap in terms of angular distance is not known beforehand we setup a threshold td  0  1  0  2  1  We need to investigate only 10 different threshold values which is much less than iteratively solving for each k 2 to k  maxk  1 in increments of 1  Generally as the value of threshold increases the number of clusters decreases as more validation nodes satisfy the threshold and fall in the same cluster For a given value of threshold t  td  we rst identify that validation node  e i  for which the number of nodes with CosDist  e i e j   t is maximum We keep the count of this number of nodes in a vector We obtain the indices of all those validation nodes and shrink the afìnity matrix A by removing the rows and columns corresponding to these indices We repeat this process recursively till it results in an empty matrix This procedure is equivalent to identifying the block diagonal structure As a result of this procedure for each value of threshold t  we obtain a vector  SizeC t  containing information about the size of clusters for that value of threshold t  In order to determine the ideal number of clusters k we use the notion of entropy and balance w.r.t the size of the clusters For each value of threshold t we have the vector SizeC t  We also put the constraint that the minimum size of a cluster is greater than or equal to M inCsize Sowe remove from SizeC t vector all the size of clusters which are less than M inCsize  The Shannon entropy for a discrete set of probabilities is deìned as H  s  t   k  i 1 p  s i  t log p  s t i    t  td 6 where H  s  t is the entropy corresponding to the vector SizeC t for the threshold t  Here s t i is the size of the i th cluster and p  s t i  is deìned as ratio between the size of i th cluster corresponding to threshold t and the size of the validation set  N valid  Entropy values are higher when there is a larger number of uniformly sized clusters Balance is generally deìned as the ratio between the minimum size cluster in SizeC t and the maximum size cluster in SizeC t  The aim of using balance is to prevent one or more large community from being superior over all other communities Higher balance promotes uniformly sized clusters and prevents few extremely large communities from being dominant This leads to more number of communities In this paper we use the overall balance criterion which is the sum of balance for all the clusters in SizeC t and deìned as B  s  t  k  i 1 s t i  max s t 1 s t k    t  td 7 where s t i represents the size of the i th cluster corresponding to threshold t  The denominator in 7 refers to maximum sized cluster for the threshold t  The higher the overall balance in the clusters the closer the value of B  s  t is to k  388 


We calculate the entropy and overall balance for each of these SizeC t and use the harmonic mean or an F-measure to determine the best of both entropy and overall balance as their values are comparable The F-measure is deìned as F  s  t  2 H  s  t B  s  t  H  s  t  B  s  t   t  td 8 where H  s  t and B  s  t represents the entropy and expected balance for threshold t  We evaluate F  s  t for all values of threshold t  td and output that value of threshold t say maxt for which F  s  t is maximum The number of clusters  k  is obtained from the vector SizeC maxt and is equal to the number of terms in this vector Algorithm 2 summarizes the proposed method for identifying the number of clusters  k n a given large scale network Algorithm 2 Algorithm to automatically identify k communities Data  E  e 1 e 2 e N valid  Result  The number of clusters k in the given large scale network 1 Construct an afìnity matrix A using the projection vectors e i  P and the similarity function CosDist   2 Set td 0  1  0  2  1  3 for each t  td do 4 Save A in a temporary variable B i.e B  A  5 Initialize the SizeC t as an empty vector 6 while B is not an empty matrix do 7 Locate the projection of validation node e i for which the number of nodes with CosDist  e i e j   t is maximum 8 Count the number of these nodes and locate the indices of these nodes 9 Append the count of these nodes to the vector SizeC t  10 Remove rows and columns corresponding to these indices 11 end 12 Calculate the entropy H  s  t from SizeC t  13 Calculate the expected balance B  s  t from SizeC t  14 Calculate the F-measure F  s  t using H  s  t and B  s  t  15 end 16 Obtain the threshold corresponding to which the F-measure is maximum as maxt  17 Estimate k as the number of terms in the vector SizeC maxt  IV E XPERIMENTS We conducted experiments on several synthetic and real world networks The synthetic networks are generated from the software proposed in with v arying the size of the network and the mixing parameter   The mixing parameter contains information about the extent of overlap between the communities in the large scale network A Experiments on Synthetic networks Figures 2,3 4 and 5 show the result of our proposed approach for identifying the number of clusters k on synthetic networks made of 5  000  10  000  25  000 and 50  000 nodes respectively We show the results for two different mixing parameters  0  1 and  0  5  For smaller  the extent of overlap is less in comparison to higher value of  and detecting communities is less difìcult From Figures 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b 5a and 5b we show that the proposed method identiìes exactly or close to the exact number of clusters present in the network even when the extent of overlap is high The adjusted rand index ARI values are also quite high suggesting that the clusters obtained via KSC are meaningful We also observe that the threshold corresponding to which we obtain the maximum F-measure is related to the mixing parameter   For the smaller mixing parameter  0  1  the threshold value t for which the F-measure is maximum is less than or equal to the threshold value corresponding to higher mixing parameter 0  5 as observed from Figures 2c 2d 3c 3d 4c 4d 5c and 5d B Experiments on Real World Datasets We conducted experiments on several real-world large scale networks ranging from trust networks PGPnet collaboration networks Cond-mat citation networks HepPh communication networks Enron social networks Epinion web graphs Youtube actor networks Imdb-actor to road networks roadCA Details about these networks are available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html Table I provides a few key statistics of each dataset Dataset Vertices Edges CCF PGPnet 10,876 39,994 0.008 Cond-mat 23,133 186,936 0.6334 HepPh 34,401 421,578 0.1457 Enron 36,692 367,662 0.497 Epinions 75,879 508,837 0.2283 Imdb-actor 383,640 1,342,595 0.453 Youtube 1,134,890 2,987,624 0.173 roadCA 1,965,206 5,533,214 0.0464 TABLE I Vertices V Edges E and Clustering Coefìcients CCF for each dataset We use the entire large scale network as test set in our experiments We use the clusters obtained by Louvain Infomap and Bigclam 28 methods as groundtruth for these networks We compare the clusters obtained via the Original KSC method w.r.t these groundtruth clusters Then we modify the Original KSC method by automatically determining the number of clusters  k  We combine our proposed approach with the original out-of-sample extension property of the KSC model to obtain the Self-Tuned KSC ST-KSC method In order to perform a comprehensive evaluation once we automatically obtain the value of k  we perform k means on the projections in the eigenspace for the validation set to obtain the centroids We obtain the projections of the test set in the eigenspace and assign the cluster membership corresponding to the centroid to which it is the closest This method is referred as Self-Tuned k means KSC ST k means KSC We 389

w.r.t Louvain Infomap and Bigclam methods The highlighted numbers represent the best results Original KSC method performs better w.r.t VI while the ST-KSC and ST k means KSC methods perform well w.r.t ARI and MI Bigclam method From Figure 6b we observe that the clusters obtained by all the KSC methods have high VI and low ARI values in comparison to the clusters obtained by Louvain and Infomap method This is because the mean number of clusters obtained by Louvain and Infomap method are 3  000 and 65  807 respectively over 10 randomizations This is much larger in comparison to the number of clusters obtained by Original KSC  3  and 39 obtained by the proposed approach However the Bigclam method identiìes 40 clusters The clusters obtained by Bigclam method have best result w.r.t VI with Original KSC method  1  075  w.r.t ARI with ST k means KSC  0  17  and w.r.t MI with ST-KSC  1  26  V C ONCLUSION In this paper we proposed an approach to make the kernel spectral clustering method free of parameters for large scale networks We used the normalized linear kernel for large scale networks and devised an approach to automatically identify the number of clusters k in the given network For achieving this we exploit the projections of the validation nodes in the eigenspace by creating an afìnity matrix which had block-diagonal structure We used the concepts of entropy and balance to identify these block-diagonals and obtain the number of clusters We compared the resulting KSC methods with large scale community detection methods like Louvain Infomap and Bigclam methods In future work we plan to evaluate the clusters obtained by the KSC methods using other likelihood based techniques like BIC and AIC Acknowledgements This work was supported by Research Council KUL

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
