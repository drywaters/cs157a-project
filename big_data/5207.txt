From Assets to Stories via the Google Cultural Institute Platform W Brent Seales Professor Computer Science University of Kentucky Lexington Kentucky USA seales@uky.edu Steve Crossan Founder Cultural Institute Google Paris France scrossan@google.com Mark Yoshitake Product Manager Cultural Institute Google Paris France myoshitake@google.com Sertan Girgin Software Engineer Google Paris France sertan@google.com Abstract The Google Cultural Institute Platform 1 is a largescale system for ingesting archiving organizing and interacting with digital assets of cultural material This paper explains the components through which the platform contextualizes individual assets in order to enable storytelling Contextualization is an inverse problem given assets that are instances of cultural material infer their precise context and use that as a way to support the storytelling process The approach is based on three components extraction knowledge and scale Extraction is the inference of context from two sources of information explicitly provided metadata and automatically extracted features Knowledge is the use of a large reference fact database for further contextualizing an asset based on its descriptors And scale achieved through global selfserve enables massively expanded coverage of the knowledge database and crowdsource potential for metadata re“nement Together these components sustain a storytelling framework and a compelling user experience that has the potential to become the largest repository of cultural information and coherent narrative in history Keywords knowledge management semantic web text analysis image analysis I I NTRODUCTION The Google Cultural Institute CI has launched a uni“ed platform for storing searching and interpreting cultural material 2 This platform is based on digital assets in the form of images video and associated metadata together with tools to manage their ingestion and artful placement within a broader narrative context via digital exhibits While a primary focus of the system is to provide a compelling engaging user experience through storytelling with cultural material in this paper we focus on the challenge of positioning assets within their correct knowledge context in order to support the construction of compelling stories Successfully meeting this challenge is important for the end users of the system who avoid tricky and burdensome constraints at asset ingestion and are rewarded with high level organized tools for compelling accurate storytelling over the appropriate assets Rather than considering ingested assets only as something to archive and retrieve the CI platform considers assets as instances of knowledge represented in a large and growing 1 google.com/culturalinstitute Figure 1 President John F Kennedy arriving at Love Field Identifying the people in the photograph together with the date or location allows to link the asset with his assassination LIFE Photo collection Arthur Rickerby fact database e.g Freebase When an asset is correctly associated with knowledge it unlocks much more contextual information about the asset than may have been provided by the user during ingestion For example an image of John F Kennedy may be dif“cult to interpret from knowing only that the image is of a person But once the person is identi“ed as Kennedy with his life carefully and completely represented by the fact database the scene can invoke a very speci“c context Fig 1 This is a kind of inverse problem inferring the place in which an asset should sit within the broader context of the knowledge represented in a fact database As such it is typically under-constrained making it a real challenge to solve There are three sets of information to exploit in relating an asset to appropriate portions of the fact database First is the asset itself which embeds unstructured information that is challenging to extract through automatic means Second is the metadata supplied by a user in the form of for example category tags and textual descriptions And third is the separate fact database which can guide inference because of the extensive set of fact and entity relationships it encodes The fact database is useless however without solving a dif“cult matching problem where assets must be associated with the correct portions of the fact database in 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 71 


order to leverage its use The interplay between the kinds of information revolving around asset ingestion sets up an interesting set of challenges Should the user be required to supply more or less direct metadata How much can be automatically extracted How reliable are the results from the automatic extraction Once a composite set of descriptors is obtained how hard is it to reliably match an asset to a precise place or set of places in the fact database In this paper we describe three components in the Cultural Institute Platform that work together at the interplay of assets and their descriptors The rst component is extraction The platform provides a straightforward ingestion operation with the ability to specify descriptive metadata in a systematic schema This metadata is valuable in understanding the asset to which it is attached In addition the platform applies a series of independent extraction algorithms to the asset in order to understand its content independently from the supplied metadata This operation can be applied in parallel and can even be periodically re-executed as they are improved The content extraction pipelines can be trained and tuned on large and independent image and video sets in order to improve performance The descriptors from this process are collected and evaluated as to their reliability and together with the provided metadata represent all that is known about the asset without reference to an external source The second component is knowledge Rather than building only a scalable storage repository for assets with associated metadata the platform views cultural assets as instances of entities in a larger independent graph of knowledge such as that embodied in a large fact database Thus ingested assets as instances of information in the graph are viewed as a means through which graph entities and relationships can be constructed con“rmed and illustrated It is arguable that cultural and historical entities can be reliably constructed only through such means where large repositories dedicated to culture and history participate actively in its emergence How to build the inference algorithms in order to correctly relate asset instances to entities is a major challenge The third component is scale through democratization The CI platform embraces and embodies the desire to preserve organize and share our collective human cultural experience Through the mechanism of self-serve and clickto-accept service agreements the platform allows broad participation from groups who can ingest assets and build exhibits Ingestion and exhibit tools are built to be accessible by average non-expert users which can inspire researchers teachers independent artists historians and virtually any group or individual working with assets in the cultural sector to share them and grow the repository toward a truly largescale system that is diverse and representative of almost all areas of human cultural experience II S TORYTELLING The CI platform is hierarchical allowing curators to form compelling and nuanced narrative presentations from underlying ingested assets This storytelling component is compelling for users who bene“t from a narrative context for individual assets and it sets the stage for the construction of context in the form of artful narrative sequences that relates sets of assets to each other Once a digital exhibit is constructed and approved it can be viewed by a global audience allowing users to engage with the story and at any time independently explore a particular asset For example the digital exhibit Bletchley Park Home of the Codebreakers Fig 2 shows the title slide of the story around the work at Bletchley Park The entry slide shows the exhibit title an overview bar along the bottom of the overall story with icons representing individual assets involved in the exhibit and the rst asset in the story an image of Her Majesty the Queen at the public memorial for Bletchley Park veterans and its outstations taken on 15 July 2011 The user can advance through the story which includes writing and images and video positioned in sequence Two assets from the exhibit Fig 3 illustrate how the nuanced context of a story can relate potentially disparate assets on one hand Her Majesty the Queen and on the other an image of the Enigma Associating these assets makes perfect sense in the context of the narrative surrounding Bletchley and more broadly the events around the Second World War The storytelling platform is premised rst on the ingestion of assets over which stories are constructed But in order for it to be easy for stories over assets to be formed it is crucial that relevant assets be organized and readily surfaced for the storyteller With storytelling as a goal the underlying components of extraction knowledge and scale must be well-managed and mutually supportive which is a major challenge III E XTRACTION Ingestion is the process of establishing an asset within the repository An asset is a composite object consisting of content e.g digital image video and metadata The ingestion process is centrally important for a number of reasons From the users perspective a simple and straightforward ingestion process facilitates rapid and ef“cient movement toward the higher-level goal of storytelling In terms of the platform and its structure ingestion is a crucial point where the asset can be contextualized and prepared for future requests such as search and use within digital exhibits And from the archivists perspective ingestion is where the asset is de“nitively speci“ed and registered within the system for safekeeping and future canonical retrieval In the CI platform the metadata of an asset consists of a set of attributes such as title description and creator Each attribute belongs to a schema either the core schema that encapsulates common attributes or a partner-speci“c 72 


Figure 2 A digital exhibit about Bletchley Park Figure 3 Examples of digital assets images used in the Bletchley Park exhibit one and has a particular type Attributes may be optional or repeatable e.g a title is required description may or may not be present and there can be multiple creators and it is possible to re“ne them in a hierarchical manner by using suf“xes e.g creator.author which enables encoding negrained semantic relationships Fig 4 shows a schematic of the components of the ingestion process At the end of the process the asset becomes a part of the repository But before that is possible the platform attempts to improve the ability to contextualize the asset using three strategies These strategies and their results are coordinated through an inference engine that can assess the reliability of these attempts at extraction and asset contextualization The feature extraction process searches the content directly for indications of objects and their attributes based on the content and on hints from the provided metadata For example The Starry Night is a mostly blue postimpressionist oil painting by Vincent van Gogh depicting a night sky Extracting the object references and attributes requires syntactic and semantic analysis of metadata and computer vision in particular image recognition and identi“cation The repository can be consulted by the inference engine to determine if the asset is similar to content that has already been ingested The result of these methods provided metadata extracted features similarity search produces a set of annotations entity annotations for the asset For a fully and completely speci“ed asset or one that is a perfect match with an already-ingested asset the resulting annotations may be very speci“c and fully-formed at this point However it may also be the case that the annotation results are incomplete and less 73 


Figure 4 Components in the ingestion and extraction pipeline speci“c than desired This is mostly due to the fact that the value of metadata attributes are usually available in freetext form only and not canonical For example the value of the location attribute may simply be Paris instead of explicit geographical coordinates Without any additional information this leads to ambiguity as it may refer to the capital of France a city in Texas USA and 15 other states or a hamlet in Denmark The rst interpretation is more likely but others are also possible Paris Europe is less ambiguous and Paris France uniquely identi“es the location Furthermore content-based recognition is also subject to noise and may not be 100 accurate The platform includes a powerful follow-on step to improve the entity annotations indicated by the dotted line in Fig 4 between entity annotations and the knowledge base which is more fully described in the next section This link sets up a feedback loop between the other ingestion and extraction components allowing for entity annotation re“nement and reference over a very large fact database The components of this ingestion pipeline driven by the inference engine make it possible to derive accurate entity annotations rather than simply requiring the used to specify them The accuracy of the derivation is dependent on reference to sources of information beyond what is initially speci“ed in the form of the existing presumably large repository the extraction algorithms trained for accurate extraction on a large corpus of material and the separate knowledge database Fig 5 shows examples of the extraction algorithms for annotations such as wood chair Fig 5a sea horizon and shore Fig 5b IV K NOWLEDGE A large fact database made of entities person place thing which have attributes and relationships can be used to solve the challenging problem of understanding the precise context of ingested assets The CI Platform uses a fact database in order to associate ingested assets with broader contextual information than what may have been provided at ingestion time This component is important as a support for storytelling because it makes it possible to produce assets during a search that are connected with the broader fact database instead of just the potentially limited metadata provided at ingestion This means that many more assets can become discoverable to the storyteller for use in the process of constructing digital exhibits The platform uses two complementary approaches in order to associate an asset with facts in the database First is the search for similar assets When an ingested asset is determined to be similar to one that is already present in the repository that association makes it possible to infer that the new asset can inherit all the context already attributed to the existing similar asset When this similarity association can be established it powerfully contextualizes the new asset Fig 4 shows the inference engines connection to the existing repository the similarity search gives the inference engine access to established annotations on similar assets Second is the attempt to infer a relationship between facts in the database and the asset metadata either that has been either provided or extracted The inference algorithm uses the assets provided and extracted metadata and searches for matching support among the fact database This is a challenging imperfect process that depends on continued analysis in order to establish con“dence thresholds that exclude spurious associations Fig 4 shows the inference engines access to the knowledge base for the purpose of this matching process The current platform contains all the components shown in Fig 4 and thus gives a unique opportunity for building and evaluating algorithms for extraction and for inference that 74 


a b Figure 5 Examples of automatic extraction of visual content objects annotated with a wood and chair and b sea horizon and shore are accurate It is important to note that nuanced annotations are notoriously dif“cult to extract automatically and it is still true that the best way to arrive at correct annotations is through human involvement The valuable by-product of the CI platform which integrates its canonical repository with storytelling through digital exhibits is that it admits a human-driven crowdsourcing for entity annotations and corrections Storytellers as well as those users immersed in stories told over annotated assets notice annotation gaps and can be encouraged to correct them This aspect of the platform is likely to become an important part of the iterative inference engine as assets and stories grow to scale With crowdsourcing in mind the platform provides a number of other attractive features that will engage users and attract them to the place where they can view evaluate and supply more information about assets For example users can construct their own exhibits with assets that they deem interesting and those assets can be compared with a visual and interactive compare tool that makes side-by-side and layer-based comparisons simple and compelling These exhibits can appear for other users in searches inspiring new storylines and comparisons among ingested assets to continue appearing as the repository grows These aspects of the platform lead toward the nal crucial component growing the number of assets and the number of digital exhibits to a very large scale V S CALE The potential scale of a repository that collects and maintains instances of cultural information is enormous Even with a very narrow de“nition of cultural such as art it is clear that the potential for large-scale information repositories is almost unbounded In fact the de“nition of culture is very broad and it is important to build coverage over the diversity and entirety of human experience While scale represents an engineering challenge it brings many potential bene“ts for the CI platform First a diverse and large-scale repository appeals to many more users allowing them to personally connect to the material and the stories As the number of assets and stories grows the number of people who connect with the material will also grow As a canonical reference platform growing to scale and covering more of the human experience allows a democratization of those experiences giving voice to a diverse range of stories And with precise organization of assets instances can be produced for users who search for speci“c examples In a very practical way growing the repository to scale will improve each of the components of the system as it is currently constructed The ingestion and extraction phase will become more streamlined as the asset repository grows systematically reducing the need for the speci“cation of large amounts of metadata with each ingested asset Scale also has a positive impact on the extraction algorithms which can be trained to be more precise at extracting visual content over a larger and larger corpus of examples Perhaps most important is the construction of the knowledge database As assets are added to a scaled-up repository the knowledge database can be extended to cover more and more facts that form a sort of entity backplate for the human experience As this database is grown the entities it contains become richly exhibited as instances of assets and stories in the platform It is currently a challenge to grow the fact database from scaled-up asset collection while preserving its accuracy and eliminating redundancies But the fact database remains a powerful approach for contextualizing assets and for supplying context for storytelling and education The CI platform will enable scale-up through a democratized approach to ingestion and storytelling Any user interested in using the platform is enabled through a simple terms-of-use agreement to provide content and supply digital exhibits Increased usage through this worldwide availability has the potential to provide the kind of scale that can lead to radical improvements in content extraction inference of complex annotations from content similarity and automated 75 


contextualization of content using the knowledge base VI C ONCLUSION The Cultural Institute platform is an integrated repository of digital content related to cultural themes art history and artifacts from antiquity The platform provides a unique way to contextualize the digital assets it ingests for the purpose of storytelling By providing an architecture and algorithms that exploit the mutually supportive components of extraction knowledge and scale the system can offer both canonical storage and an engaging user experience through digital exhibitions The challenge of requiring the content provider to supply exhaustive metadata around each and every ingested asset is made easier through automated matching algorithms that search for similar assets as well as visual content extraction to identify latent content that is not necessarily speci“ed in the metadata In addition access to a large fact database enables an inference engine to contextualize assets within a large and growing set of entities properties and relationships The architecture is built to scale through selfserve ingestion and individual users who are empowered to provide content Scaling the number of assets the size of the fact database and the power of the visual content extraction algorithms then makes the system increasingly more accurate and re“ned in its organization and contextualization of its holdings This platform uniquely supports artful and compelling storytelling premised on the components of extraction knowledge and scale The user experience is signi“cantly improved for each of the user actions content ingestion creation of digital exhibits viewing content and understanding its interpretive framework through these components Ultimately it will be user inspiration that drives such a collection to become large well-organized and compelling to explore A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank Victor Ribeiro and the CI Engineering team at Google Paris for continued impact through implementation of the platform W B Seales was a visiting researcher at the Google Cultural Institute during the 201213 academic year R EFERENCES  E Pf anner  Quietly  Google puts history online  The New York Times  11 2011 A v ailable http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/technology/quietlygoogle-puts-history-online.html  Google Cultural Institute launches ne w platform for cultural sector Collections Trust 10 2012 A v ailable http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk/googleinstitute  B R Schatz and H Chen Building lar ge-scale digital libraries IEEE Computer  vol 29 no 5 pp 22…26 1996  K Bollack er  C  E v ans P  P aritosh T  Stur ge and J T aylor  Freebase a collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge in SIGMOD 08 Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  New York NY USA ACM 2008 pp 1247…1250  D Zhang M M Islam and G Lu  A r e vie w o n automatic image annotation techniques Pattern Recognition  vol 45 no 1 pp 346…362 2012 76

tionship between beer brands and customers Our proposed criterion played an important role in determining the number of clusters in this analysis We nally compare our proposed criterion with other ones For example AIC discovered four customer clusters and the customer behavior suggested by each cluster is rather different from that given by NML ICL selected only ve brand clusters whereas results of NML also distinguished brand clusters B and E Each of these results shows certain aspects of the data but we emphasize that the model selection results given by NML are justi“ed from the perspective of data compression VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have addressed the issue of statistical model selection in GRD modeling From the viewpoint of the MDL principle we have clari“ed the asymptotic property of NML in GRD modeling and have proposed a new model selection criterion We have applied our proposed criterion to the issue of model selection in SBM learning and have derived a new and ef“cient method of calculating the NML code-length for SBM The effectiveness of our NML-based criterion has been demonstrated experimentally using arti“cial data and real beer-purchase data Thus for the rst time we have realized a model selection technique that considers the statistical characteristics of GRD models We will extend our discussion to other problems and criteria A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by MEXT KAKENHI 23240019 by the Aihara Project the FIRST program from JSPS initiated by CSTP by HAKUHODO Inc and by MACROMILL Inc R EFERENCES  B Long Z Zhang and P  S Y u  Relational Data Clustering Models Algorithms and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2010  T  Roos T  Silander  P  K ontkanen and P  Myllymaki Bayesian network structure learning using factorized NML universal models in Information Theory and Applications Workshop  Feb 2008 pp 272 276  P  K ontkanen P  Myllym  aki W Buntine J Rissanen and H Tirri An MDL framework for data clustering in Advances in Minimum Description Length Theory and Applications  MIT Press 2005  A T  Cemgil Bayesian inference for nonne gati v e matrix factorisation models Intell Neuroscience  vol 2009 pp 4:1…4:17 Jan 2009  H Akaik e  A ne w look at the statistical model identi“cation  IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control  vol 19 no 6 pp 716  723 Dec 1974  G E Schw arz Estimating the dimension of a model  Annals of Statistics  vol 6 pp 461…464 1978  E M Airoldi D M Blei S E Fienber g and E P  Xing Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels J Mach Learn Res  vol 9 pp 1981…2014 Jun 2008  J Rissanen Modeling by shortest data description  Automatica  vol 14 no 5 pp 465  471 1978   Fisher information and stochastic comple xity   IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 42 no 1 pp 40 47 Jan 1996  Y  M Shtark o v  Uni v ersal sequential coding of single messages Problems of Information Transmission  vol 23 no 3 pp 3…17 1987  S Hirai and K Y amanishi Ef cient computation of normalized maximum likelihood coding for Gaussian mixtures with its applications to optimal clustering in Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ISIT  Aug 2011 pp 1031 1035  J Rissanen MDL denoising  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 46 no 7 pp 2537 2543 Nov 2000  Y  Hayashi and K Y amanishi Sequential netw ork change detection with its applications to ad impact relation analysis in IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM2012  2012 pp 280…289  T  A Snijders and K No wicki Estimation and prediction for stochastic blockmodels for graphs with latent block structure Journal of Classi“cation  vol 14 pp 75…100 1997  N Friedman L Getoor  D  K oller  and A Pfef fer  Learning probabilistic relational models in Proceedings of the 16th international joint conference on Arti“cial intelligence  vol 2 1999 pp 1300…1307  J.-J Daudin F  Picard and S Robin A mixture model for random graphs Statistics and Computing  vol 18 no 2 pp 173…183 2008  C K emp J B T enenbaum T  L Grif ths T  Y amada and N Ueda Learning systems of concepts with an in“nite relational model in Proceedings of the 21st national conference on Arti“cial intelligence  2006 pp 381…388  C S W allace and P  R Freeman Estimation and inference by compact coding Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B Methodological  vol 49 no 3 pp pp 240…265 1987  C Biernacki G Celeux and G Go v aert  Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence IEEE Transactions on  vol 22 no 7 pp 719…725 2000  H Jef fre ys  A n i n v ariant form for the prior probability in estimation problems in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A Mathematical and Physical Sciences  vol 186 no 1007 1946 pp 453…461  I S Dhillon S Mallela and D S Modha Informationtheoretic co-clustering in Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  2003 pp 89…98 429

and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US foreign policy  This paper has multiple limitations on its research. The datasets included are only for the three most recent female Secretar ies of State and cannot be used to generalize an overall US foreign policy message. Also, there is a gap between the three female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary Powell was not included Another limitation is the lack of keyword in context analysis. Although these keywords and phrases are important due to their number of times used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of these important keywords and phrases will lead to deeper insights and more complex nuances  This study is an initial analysis on three separate datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to deeper understandings of the frequently occurring keywords and phrases that are predominant from each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will provide further unpacking a nd clearer definitions of what each keyword or phrase means when the Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and geography. This analysis will be completed on Secretary Rice and Secretary Albrights datasets as well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powells tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes are consistent with those before and after his term Future research will also include the final two approaches from the ASSANA Methodology traditional hand coding as well as the High Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating these other approaches will allow for a full review of the differences in findings and time for analysis between each approach
