  Abstract 227 Grid computing is evolving fast, with specific needs for computing power, storage capacity and available bandwidth.  Network security is a big concern for grid networks because attacks can endanger the availability of grid usual services. High amounts of data transferred between sites can make difficult the traffic analysis needed to identify possible cyber-attacks. This paper presents some aspects about network 
specific security improvements done in RO-LCG and how existing open-source tools can be used to gather, analyze and discover relevant information about what is happening within the network Keywords\227 grid site; netflow network security; LHCONE;ROLCG;RoEduNet;open-source I   I NTRODUCTION  Grid technology is making big contribution to scientific research, helping scientists ar 
ound the world to store and analyze massive amounts of data.  There are hundreds of thousands of servers used in grid for computing power in various domains like: biology, earth science, high-energy physics, engineering, arts and social scien a m ple for the project Large Hadron Collider \(LHC\t CERN [2 collaboration entity called Worldwide LHC Computing Grid WLCG\was created, with more than 170 grid sites in about 40 countries   
 Figure 1. Romanian grid sites  In Romania, the contribution to WLCG is represented by RO-LCG, a federation of tier 2 grid sites located at member institutions re 1 s h o w s each  R O L C G g r id s ite contribution related to processing power \(CPU\O-LCG provides about 99% of Romanian grid production F o r  each site, monitoring software in place tests the functionality of the most important grid services such as computing element, storage element and BDII \(Berkeley Database 
Information Index A generic grid infrastructure is divided in four layers, two layers for the hardware-centric part \(Network layer and Resource layer\and other two on top of them for the usercentric part \(Middleware layer and Application layer\. The architecture of a grid site is depicted in Figure 2. In every grid site there is installed a middleware responsible for the management of all resources provided by the resource layer. A number of services are provided by this layer, such as job 
management, authentication, authorization, and security. These services are 200  Computing Element \(CE\[1  is res p o n sib l e f o r jo b s  management within the site, CPU and memory resources allocation, work nodes monitoring and access rights 200  Storage Element \(SE\ is responsible for managing disk space, data access rights depending on which organization the user belongs and file management 200 
 User Interface \(UI\, is responsible for jobs to be executed submission, job cancelling, copying and deleting files from the grid system and retrieving the output of finished jobs 
200  Work nodes \(WN\, are responsible for the management and execution of jobs within the server   Figure 2. Generic grid site architecture 


 The grid sites are interconnected using national or continental education networks \(see Figure 2\. As in networking, to have the same advantages of separating functions and allowing the independent evolution of technologies, the proposed model is organized in layers starting with hardware-centric and ending with user-centric layers  Since the grid sites are interconnected it is possible that they are exposed to cyber-attacks. In this paper, we will describe the monitoring process of cyber-attacks in the national grid sites that helps us to improve the security level and to fix some problems II  N ETWORK I NFRASTRUCTURE  Data communication between RO-LCG sites and with other WLCG members is done using RoEduNet \(Romanian Education Network\ infrastructure. RoEduNet is the name of the Romanian National Research and Education Network NREN\, which participates with other NRENs in forming the pan-European GEANT network  [5   RoEduNet uses optical fiber and DWDM equipment to provide needed capacity parameters for data circuits. Data is passed through the optical network using routing equipment installed in Network Operation Centers \(NOCs\. This equipment is interconnected with multiple 10 Gbps circuits and 100 Gbps lambdas\ to achieve redundancy Figure 3 shows the relevant part of RoEduNet network area surrounded with dashed line\ and existing Romanian grid sites, members or not of RO-LCG  Figure 3. RoEduNet and Romanian grid sites  Connectivity between GRID sites and RoEduNet NOCs is done using optical fiber. In Bucharest NOCs \(labeled as NAT and BUC in Figure 3\ and Cluj NOC \(CLU\, GRID sites were connected within the metropolitan area, while in Iasi NOC IAS\the RO-16-UAIC site is co-located within RoEduNet Iasi NOC datacenter Recently RoEduNet DWDM network was extended from Bucharest NOC to Magurele \(MAG\tes, using a point of presence installed at IFIN-HH premises. Using DWDM technology, available capacity for sites connected to MAG can be easily increased as needed, with costs covering new transponders procurement and installation Upstream communication is done using the connection between RoEduNet border router and Bucharest GEANT POP 5  b o th in stal le d in  Ro E d u Ne t d a t a c e n t e r at  NOC NA T  Data traffic of GRID sites uses same physical infrastructure as other institutions connected to RoEduNet. In November 2012 RoEduNet joined LHCONE networ w h i c h a i ms t o  connect CERN LHC project sites within at least a logically separated network. Traffic separation is done using the socalled L3 VPN with VRF technology \(VPN Routing and Forwarding\  [7 V R F t e c hnol o g y i m p l i e s t h e us e o f a n  MPLS  core, a separate forwarding table within the routing equipment and some way to classify the traffic as \223interesting\224, e.g. to be routed via dedicated LHCONE VRF. The decision to include traffic into a VRF instance can be made by incoming interface or by source IP address. For RO-LCG sites, the solution using source IP addresses is used because there were no available separate network interfaces to connect only GRID sites to RoEduNet routers. Also, we wanted to avoid complicating existing IP addressing plans Upstream connection of RoEduNet LHCONE VRF to GEANT uses a virtual interface configured over the 10G circuit between RoEduNet border router and Bucharest GEANT POP router. GEANT provides LHCONE traffic separation within its infrastructure using the same VRF solution Figure 4 shows a rough relevant map of GEANT network and LHCONE connected sites 1 also GEANT connections to other WLCG structures around the world are represented in the upper part of the picture  Figure 4. GEANT and LHCONE    1 Figure 4 uses information provided in a DANTE presentation at LHCONE Meeting held in Washington on 31 st January, 2013, and after some updates received from the author of the presentation https://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=1&resId=1&materialId=sli des&confId=212656  


 Inside GEANT, routing information needed for data transport is provided using BGP routing protocol. Each LHCONE national-level aggregator \(e.g. NREN\ announces into GEANT LHCONE VRF only IPv4 prefixes of LHCONE members within the country  III  N ETWORK M ONITORING  Because the complexity and needs of LHCONE, the usual task of network monitoring is more important. There are many software tools that can ease this. Some of the tools used in RoEduNet for network monitoring are NMIS  Ca ct i   9  and  NfSen/nfdump [1 Cacti is a solution for network graphing based on information collected using various acquisition methods. The information is stored in RRD  a nd  c a n b e vi sua l i z ed usi ng an intuitive web interface. Network traffic values, equipment environmental parameters, server\222s resources usage are some examples of graphs that can be obtained using Cacti tool Figure 5 show traffic statistics for the Romanian LHCONE community since LHCONE setup is in production. Figure 5 a shows network traffic as it is seen from RoEduNet side and it is taken from a Cacti instance running at RoEduNet network management system \(NMS\, while Figure 5 b\ is from GEANT NMS  Figure 5. a\affic RoEduNet monitored b traffic \226 GEANT monitored  Because of the data sampling used for these graphs \(once per day at 3:00 am\raffic seems to be not so big. Average values are calculated for the entire span of time covered by the graph that means one year An increase of traffic may be observed at the beginning of July, when sites from Magurele were connected to RoEduNet LHCONE VRF, after installing a new router in MAG RoEduNet site \(Figure 3 One of the widely used sets of tools for network traffic tracking and for network security incidents handling in NREN community is NfSen/nfdump. These tools are based on netflow Netflow  [12 is a p r o t o c o l u s ed t o c o l l ec t in f o rm atio n  about IP traffic. Network equipment that supports netflow can export so-called netflow records to a data collecting system where information will be stored and analyzed. Netflow records are exported using UDP, each record has relevant information about flows passed through exporting equipment Such information is ingress and egress interfaces, source and destination IPv4/IPv6 address, source and destination ports for TCP or UDP, type of service, next-hop and other, but no user data is present Nfdump is the basis of NfSen/nfdump suite, collecting and storing flow information exported by routing equipment. It is also capable to generate various traffic statistics from gathered data, beginning with plain flow listing and going to various top N statistics, being able to do filtering of displayed information according to the analysis needs of the operator Nfsen is in fact a frontend with web interface that facilitates drawing graphs from captured data and generate alerts if specified conditions are met. Current network traffic or specific profiled graphics can be created. Figure 6 is an example for the NfSen web interface used at RoEduNet, showing information for a specific profile created for Romanian grid sites  Figure 6. NfSen web interface  The Figure 6 displays network traffic and traffic values for each site, while at the bottom part of the picture there are some tools to generate reports based on pre-configured or user-based filters. Displayed information can be an overview of all collected traffic information or generated using profiles. A profile can contain filters reassembling to those used with tcpdump, such as matching a host, a network prefix, a TCP or UDP port, protocol or combinations of these  IV   RESULTS  Using network monitoring tools, it can be observed that between RO-LCG and WLCG there is traffic varying between generous values, going up to 10 Gbps. To make a detailed analysis for this traffic it is necessary a big storage space and powerful servers. One good solution for this problem is to use the NfSen/nfdump tools Using the described NfSen/nfdump suite, traffic tracking and analysis can be done for RO-LCG sites \(Figure 7\. In this a b 


graph the network traffic of the sites is represented in logarithm scale because we want to visualize the traffic per institution Sites located at Magurele are all shown as IFIN because they use IP addresses from one /24 prefix. Correlating Figure 7 with Figure 1, it can be observed that the traffic is proportional with computing power available to each institution   Figure 7. Traffic statistics RO-LCG institutions  Before Romania sites were part of LHCONE network all the grid traffic was send only to France because RO-LCG was connected to Tier-1 grid infrastructure called ATLAS FRANCE CLOUD. Now it is possible to transfer information to all Tier-1 and Tier-2 sites.

Top 5 trafic statis tic of RO-LCG ATLAS sites   Figure 8. a\ Total traffic in the Romanian LHCONE. b\ Suspect traffic in the Romanian LHCONE  It is difficult to analyze the traffic of a grid site because it is not uniform \(see Figure 6\ and may be compared with a cyberattack like distributed denial-of-service attack \(DDOS\. As a first stage, tracing and removal of the rightful known traffic from total traffic \(Figure 8 a\ is needed. To remove the legitimate traffic we configured a new profile in NfSen and we select traffic that does not use known TCP or UDP ports in grid technology. With this mechanism the amount of information to be analyzed is greatly reduced and thus we may find easier the traffic outside of WLCG scope, as it can be seen in Figure 8 a b 


For example we analyzed the top traffic between Sep 10 2013 - 15:30 - Sep 10 2013 - 19:20 and we found that 52.5 of Magurele traffic \(Figure 8 b\s on port 53 \(~400K packets and have suspect requests coming from IP addresses registered in United States, Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, Spain Kazakhstan, Syria and others that could indicate an attack method similar to the one that uses open recursive resolvers  In the top traffic between Sep 15 2013 - 13:40 - Sep 15 2013 - 22:05 we identified an possible brute force attack from United States to RO-16-UAIC, from Pakistan to RO-14-ITIM and from China and Germany to NIPNE  V  C ONCLUSIONS  This article describes the research and education network from Romania and the services offered for RO-LCG grid community, such as LHCONE access used to connect CERN LHC project sites within at least a logically separated network Another service offered by RoEduNet is Network Monitoring that helps grid sites to get traffic statistics and warnings about various attacks This paper presents a method to analyze the Romania LHCONE traffic and identify two possible cyber-attacks: brute force attack and open recursive resolvers attack A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, project number 8EU 03.01.2012, named \223National contribution to the development of the LCG computing grid for elementary particle physics\224  R EFERENCES   1  Gridcafe http://www.gridcafe.org  2  CERN http://home.web.cern.ch  3  WLCG http://wlcg.web.cern.ch  4  RO-LCG http://lcg.nipne.ro/index.php  5  G\311ANT http://www.geant.net/Pages/default.aspx  6  LHCONE http://lhcone.net  7  J.

VI Conclusion and Outlook In the given work we presented our HIG system architecture for genome data processing based on an IMDB system Based on our in-memory research activities we outlined the applicability of this technology for processing of genome data to enable its real-time analysis Furthermore we shared insights in the speciìc architecture layers from an IT perspective and outlined details about select IMDB extensions for genome data processing such as scheduling worker framework or updater framework The obtained benchmark results showed that our HIG system architecture improves overall pipeline execution time by at least 25 percent on a single compute node and up to 89 percent involving 25 compute nodes The performance boost is mainly derived from substituting intermediate processes such as sorting merging and indexing by native IMDB operations In future we will investigate the impact of optimized alignment and variant calling algorithms that directly incorporate IMDB technology We expect to further eliminate media breaks and to improve performance due to data proximity References  F  S  C ollin s et al  New Goals for the U.S Human Genome Project Science  vol 282

 7 5  S UMMARY  The purpose of this paper was to introduce a modifi ed VCM system design for near and deep space communication s Software simulation of this design was performed to  determine throughput improvements and verify the feasibility of the whole design  Problems with fra me descriptor identification were resolved by unique l ength VCM modes and inferring the VCM mode though frame marker spacing.  The simulation looked at an exampl e of a varying communications link polar orbiting CubeSat s Simulation showed that the proposed VCM system roug hly doubles throughput and slightly outperforms similar  VCM codes like SCCC and DVBS2  Future work for the proposed VCM system includes eliminating the frame descriptor from transmission developing an optimal  mode selection algorithm, and developing the proposed sy stem in hardware specifically for CubeSat application A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  The research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology und er a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the University of Alaska Fairban ks College of Engineering and Mines funded in part by  the Alaska Space Grant Program R EFERENCES  1  J   C u t t l e r  a n d  J   M a n n    G l o b a l  G r o u n d  S t a t i o n  Survey 5 th  Annual CubeSat Developers Workshop  August 2008 http://gs.engin.umich.edu/documents/Mann_etal_2008 pd f 2  M   C a f f r e y    E x p l o i t i n g  L i n k  D y n a m i c s  i n  L E O t o Ground Communications 6 th  Annual CubeSat Developerís Workshop  San Luis Obispo CA 2009 http://www.cubesat.org/images/cubesat/presentations Dev elopersWorkshop2009/4_Comm/2_CaffreyLink_Dynamics.pdf 3  F l e x i b l e  A d v a n c e d  C o d i n g  a n d  M o d u l a t i o n  S c h e m e  for High Rate Telemetry Applications CCSDS 131.2-B-1 Blue Book Issue 1 March 2012 http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x2b 1.pdf 4  T M  S y n c h r o n i z a t i o n  a n d  C h a n n e l  C o d i n g    C C S D S  131.0-B-2  Blue Book Issue 2 August 2011 http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x0b 2ec1.p df 5  J   H a m k i n s    P e r f o r m a n c e  o f  l o w d e n s i t y  p a r i t y check coded modulation Aerospace Conference 2010 IEEE  vol., no., pp.1-14, 6-13 March 2010 6  S   O l i v i e r i    M o d u l a r  F P G A B a s e d  S o f t w a r e  D e f i n ed Radio for CubeSats Worcester Polytechnic Institut e May 2011  7  D i g i t a l  V i d e o  B r o a d c a s t i n g   D V B    S e c o n d  g e n e r ation framing structure, channel coding and modulation sy stems for Broadcasting Interactive Services News Gather ing and other broadband satellite applications ETSI EN  302 307, v1.1.2,2006 B IOGRAPHIES   Thomas A Sielicki  received a B.S degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia in 2010.

real world, the price of cloud storage is different according to different usages. In the future, we will incorporate more complex pricing models in our datasets storage cost model Furthermore, methods for forecasting dataset usage frequency can be further studied, with which our T-CSB algorithm can be adapted to different types of applications more easily A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research work reported here is partly supported by Australian Research Council under DP110101340 and LP130100324, Shanghai Knowledge Service Platform Project No. ZF1213.
