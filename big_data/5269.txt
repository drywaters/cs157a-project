Web association rules mining , based on statistics, usually pays attention to the analysis on existing data ,they can\222t offer effective predictive means and optimizing measure and can not find out the latent and possible rules. This paper presents a kind of system of the Web association rules mining based on genetic algorithm, which proves by experiment that it can mend the traditional Web association mining method of lack of foreseeing in latency. And it puts forward a new ideal of Web association rules mining  
  Index Terms- Data Mining, Web Association Rules, Genetic Algorithm, Increment Mining, Machine Learning I NTRODUCTION  Through analyzing the visiting behavior of lots of Web 
users, We can get the users class attributes and Web association rules\(WAR\which describe their individuality. Its\222 form is just like production of the First-order logic, and is the important foundation for analyzing accessing and describing Web user\222s behavior characters. We can use traditional association mining algorithm based on statistics to dig out the rules correctly, but it can not do something on users learning procedure and personality growing. Genetic algorithm\(GA\ is a kind of searching and optimizing algorithm with advantage of intelligence and self-learning which simulates biology evolution procedure[1,2 A n d it w ill i m p r o v e f l ex ib ilit y  o f  association mining algorithm with combining GA and statistic mining algorithm and makes up the insufficiency of mining result which is based on users of specified class, and can capture the procedure of users\222 psychology by machine 
learning   G ENETIC ASSOCIATION MINING S YSTEM  Web users\222 accessing manner is related to a certain period of the accessing behavior. The users\222 behavior will keep steady via a period of accessing and their interest will change with   long time passed, such as a month or so long Such procedure shows self-learning and growth on the Web site, and usually Web users will go through . If we can capture the changing procedure of Web users, with association rules mined through machine learning, the results 
 of mining will take on  the excellence of foreseeing, veracity and intelligence It is the import basement of genetic association mining that we use increment mode to mine. Increment mining contains the changing of user behavior character, procedure of maturing, which is mainly basis of studying for GA 
Processing log data in the Web server for a long period will cost huge time, and low efficiency, while large Web site\222s log data size can be the level of Gigabyte\(GB\. And if we do not consider time persistence in the Web log , it will result in incorrectness or inaccurateness. Frequent items mining will partly lose or wrongly calculate out, if we don\222t use increment mining algorithm. So it is necessary that we carry out increment mining, while it is also basis and direction of GA evolution Fig.1 shows genetic association mining structure considering  increment  mining 
                          Fig.1 Genetic association mining structure From Fig.1,We use Genetic association mining to get association rules on total original transaction with increment 
mining algorithm .And then coding the association rules into chromosomes, which we can apply GA to mine under direction of rule guiding from the increment t mining result The results of researching of increment mining show that it is available to design increment mining algorithm on traditional statistic algorithm, such as SFUP  \(Super Fast Update Algorithm\increment algorithm base on Apriori

 DHP[1,3 T h ere are t w o cas es i n i n cre m ent data m i n i n g   one is keeping the support and confidence threshold stable mining the association rules on appending the increment transaction database into original database, and the other is keeping transaction database stable, mining rules considering the change of support and confidence Doctor Cheng has put forward the FUP\(Fast Update Algorithm\ that has solved the problem of case one, but in case two, the calculation procedure is more complex IUA\(Incremental Updating Algorithm\ can solve it which is described in the fourth paper in detail [4   D ESIGNING AND REALIZATION OF G ENETIC MINING FOR ASSOCIATION RULES  Association rules are hotspot  of Knowledge Discovery in Database\(KDD\d in  KDD , association rules as a kind of knowledge form are usually  defined X=>Y        \(1 X and Y are  aggregate of items which represent foreside and backside of the rule. It is basic form of association rules in data mining . In the Web association mining with GA, chromosome coding, genetic operator designing and constringency condition is core of GA applying th e W e b as s o ciation  m i n i ng s t r u ctu r e, t h e purpose is to mine association   rules base on cluster of users which fits the their behaviour characters. And in Web mining association rules form can be defined url 1 url 2 205url m url m k,url m+k+1 205,url m+m  support=? ,confidence=?   \(2 On analyzing topology of Web sites,  its\222 equal form is urlcode 1 urlcode 2 205urlcode m urlcode m+k urlcode m+k+1 205,urlcode m+m 3 Here, urlcodei represents code value of the url in layeres scheme coding ,which mainly consideres the Web topology A  Chromosome Coding  This paper introduces a kind of mutative length characters coding scheme, while Web association rules\222 property determines that its\222 length may not be equal in our experiment system Eg.  a association rule is list below\(URL codes formula the number represents corresponding in Web site  282574488338432, 2814749767106 282583078273  That corresponding chromosome code is defined 2:1#282574488338432281474976710656282583078273024 2:1 is chromosome data of structure which stands for that the foreside of chromosome is composed of two coding URL and the rearward is one, # is character for dividing In the actual GA mining, binary coding is also adopted the chromosome showed  above can be also coded as 10:1#100000001000000000000000000000000000000000000 00001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00010000000100000010000000000000000000000000000000 00 B. Designing Function of Fitness Genetic association rules mining is a kind of foreseeing mining to find out probably excellent rules ,which is a kind of special heuristic searching based on exist rules. It may causes the problem that rules mined with GA are not valid or can not easily to determine its\222 accurate confidence and support value Therefore, defining fitness function of new chromosome from genetic mining should differ from statistic mining chromosome For increment mining indicates learning procedure of Web users, we can define new chromosome\222s fitness value in increment mining as similarity degree that relates to the most like chromosome from genetic mining. And chromosome from statistic mining fitness value is mainly composed of its support and confidence Defines:Fit\(chromosome sup     1 _ _  2 cf K CF chromosome K SUP chromosome F Like chromosome F Near chromosome  If  exist chromosome0,chromosome1,chromosome2,\205chromomosome N swarm, and the nearest distance between any two chromosome is chromosome0 and chromosome1 Supposed  chromosome0=2:1#A1B1C1  chromosome1=2:1#P1Q1N1  chromosome2=2:1#X1Y1Z1 A1-P1 2 B1Q1 2 C1-N1 2  1/2  A1-X1 2 B1Y1 2 C1-Z1 2  1/2  If dis1<dis2 then F_near\(chromosome chromosome1 2  F_like\(chromesome, chromosome1  Define  F_like\(chromesome,chromosome1\=\(1-dis1/|chromosome Kcf*CF\(chromosome\p*SUP\(chromosome C. Define Genetic Operator and Convergence Condition 1  Selector operator\222s function is to select father chromosomes into mating pool according to fitness value, and its\222 scheme is betting with excellence reservation. It is same to the selector in genetic cluster, here the selector probability is set to 0.8 by experiment testing \( The detail is shown in conference 7 2    case \(1\ents chromosome mined from statistic algorithm case\(2\ents chromosome mined from genetic algorithm Kcf represents coefficient of confidence, Ksup represents coefficient of support F_like is function for that chromosome have the most similarity, F_near is function for calculating out the chromosome which is the nearest to the independent variable of chromosome. They both foundation is built on distance which can be calculated in layer-coding scheme for URL   1  Define: F_near\(chromosome0  Selector Operator  Crossover Operator 


the best matching allele selecting cross mode exchanging the alleles  Theory of selecting Crossover operator is based on knowledge tree of GA, which colony searching strategy and exchanging between individuals is the mainly based on their characters. It is kernel idea that we use GA to try, to search and make the knowledge trees evolve. And for survival of fittest, it will reserve the more high fitness value trees, while the evolvement results may not be the best. On the other hand GA adopts genes adjustment and combination that will make more high individuals and new knowledge trees. Finally we will get better new rules in the higher fitness trees There are three cases in knowledge trees for crossover operator Case 1  exchanging subtrees in the same knowledge tree Case 2  exchanging subtrees between knowledge tree Case 3  using child node\(include leaf node\cestor node\(include indirect ancestor The three cases  are showed in the Fig.2  b   c  Fig.2 Crossover in knowledge  The probability of crossover operator is usually set to over 0.9 in order to guaranteeing evolving speed. When it carrys out genetic mining crossover operator, first should make the allele on the same location, then exchanges them on each position.  Furthermore, designing of crossover operator should pay attention to chromosomes structure of gene and the operator\222s enthusiasm and scope for gene\222s exchanging in Web association mining. Fig.3 shows the flow chart of crossover operator ool  a                    Gene activity of exchanging  Conservative: That each exchanging gene belongs to same subtree and same layer Active: That each exchanging gene belongs to same layer but not same subtree Scope of exchanging Case 1  Only exchanges allele subtree of rules rear Case 2  Only exchanges allele subtree of rules head Case 2  Exchanges the allele of whole rules 3\.Mutation Operator The purpose of using mutation operator is mainly for importing new genes and not exist individuals in parents swarm. During carrying out in Web association rules mining considering mutation individuals may not actual exist ,that gene codes is according to real URL codes, we usually set mutation probability quite small , as below 0.01 ,and will validate the new genes generated by mutation 4  Constringency Condition Usually, there two states should be regarded, and one is that algorithm has found the best results or steady swarms appear, the other is that program of algorithm have run over specified generations . We usually set priority later higher than the front 5  Rules Decoding  Decoding is not too complex, that is reversion procedure of coding. Its process is to translate chromosomes to association rules, and validate rules in Web sites from genetic mining D. The Whole Procedure of Association Rules Mining with GA In the mining system, all jobs can be divided into several parts. The first step is to draw the rules from  the knowledge warehouse which has been built by statistics mining algorithm Then puts these rules into mating pool which have been coded into chromosomes form, and these rules are regard as father chromosomes. The second step of procession is to makes these father chromosomes to be matched into groups every two , and makes  alleles of father chromosomes on the same location  p s parent chromosome mates in evolution Analyzing parents chromosomes, searching calculate chromosomes fitness value Fig.3 Crossover operator flow chart 


TABLE 1 rules decoding   E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  In our experiment system, the whole mining procedure is composed of several steps. The beginning is preparing data for mining ,which includes job of  extracting data from  Web site\222s log and analyzing structure of Web sites topology.  Then clusteres the web users into several swarms  for characters analyzing ,and the last is mining association rules with genetic algorithm Here,  the emphases is to find out the specialty of  mining rules with genetic algorithm . So we test validity and efficiency of association rules which had been mined from several algorithm as comparison from Table 2, it  shows  that algorithm with GA has excellence of foreseeing, that more association rules can be mined out in time without sufficient log data supporting. Using GA with Aprori or FP-Tree to mine association rules can find out more than that only with Apriori or FP-Tree and it can raise the adaptability for intelligence and personality of analyzing users characteristic behavior. So applying the rules from GA, we can guide and forecast Web users behavior on Web site, which does work for searching personality of Web intelligent service system Han J, Kamber M, Data Mining :Concepts and Techniques.

The third step is to makes chromosomes 222s genes mutate using  mutation operator, validates availability of these chromosomes After these three steps , the last job is to calculate the fitness of these chromosomes, and judge the constringency condition And if meets the constringency condition of GA, then do the rule decoding work, else go to the first step for next cycle. In the end of the processing  that has satisfied the constringency condition of GA, does the work of decoding of chromosomes Table 1 shows the results to decode rules into URL forms with a few part of data Ya-ling Tang, Zhi-ming Cui, Research on Web users clustering based on genetic algorithm, Microelectronics and Computer,Vol.21,no.8,pp:65~67,Aug 2004 Condition before decoding Condition  transaction decoded Result before decoding Result  transaction 28433351 1593984 2891315 58105088 2858330 23221360 http://192.168.1.7:8080/su da/SZUniversity/polparty htm;http://192.168.1.7:80 80/suda/SZUniversity/cult ure.htm;http://192.168.1.7 8080/suda/SZUniversity management.htm 2825344 88338432 http://192.168.1 7:8080/suda/SZ University/guide htm 28253448 8338432 28433351 1593984 http://192.168.1.7:8080/su da/SZUniversity/guide.ht m;http://192.168.1.7:8080 suda/SZUniversity/polpar ty.htm 28143493 6310656 28913155 8105088 http://192.168.1 7:8080/suda/ind ex.htm;http://19 2.168.1.7:8080/s uda/SZUniversit y/culture.htm 28433351 1593984 2836339 99966208 2891315 58105088 http://192.168.1.7:8080/su da/SZUniversity/polparty htm;http://192.168.1.7:80 80/suda/SZUniversity/dep a.htm;http://192.168.1.7:8 080/suda/SZUniversity/cu lture.htm 2953686 23831344 2858330 23221360 http://192.168.1 7:8080/suda/SZ University/recr.h tm;http://192.16 8.1.7:8080/suda SZUniversity/m anagement.htm Ming-qiang Lin, Genetic Algorithm\222s Basic Theory and Application BeiJing:Science Press ,2002 3   TABLE 2 algorithms for contrast Web site Algo rith m log transaction amount megabyte Rules amount Accept rules Adaptability percent Suzhou university simulated Apriori 6.4 193 178 92.22 FP Tree 6.4 193 178 92.22 GA with Apriori or FP Tree 6.4 231 219 94.81  CONCLUSIONS GA has the excellence of implicit parallelism, that Holland had pointed out that it processes mode on level of O\(n 3 ut in fact it  only does the calculation only on level O\(n\ our experiment system, GA do thoroughly calculation for data mining ,so that we can find out the expected and latent association rules in our transaction database by genetic learning mode. Our system is the data analyzing part of intelligence service of Web, and test data includes Web log and site topology drawn out from Suzhou University Web site built by the  Institute of  Intelligent information Processing and Application Finally ,The results of analyzing show that we can realize the optimizing and forecasting for exist and latent association rules, by utilizing GA to mine the statistic mining result, and it surely can compensates halfway results that by the no sufficient visiting amount of Web users on one certain class swarm. Thus, we draw a conclusion that the genetic mining can catch up with this learning procedure of Web users well enough, and it is also a new research direction for Web using mining  REFERCENCES  1  B.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
