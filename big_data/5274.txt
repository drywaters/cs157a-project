     This work is partially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities #QN0906   Abstract Mining frequent patterns has attracted considerable attention in the data mining field. Most of the current studies adopt the pattern growth approach of divide-and 
conquer. However, as the mining process is completely split into parts, all relevant algorithms still encounter some performance bottlenecks. In this study, we propose a new data structure Share-struct, which is derived but obviously different from FPtree. Then we developed an efficient algorithm, Share-Inherit, for mining all frequent patterns. Based on the Share-struct, ShareInherit provides a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively thereby dramatically reducing the cost of traversing FP-tree and significantly improving the performance of algorithms based on 
pattern growth. Furthermore, various optimization techniques used in Share-Inherit sufficiently improve the algorithm. The experimental results show that Share-Inherit algorithm not only performs better than the existing algorithms using pattern growth, but also improves them by incorporating Share-Inherit strategy 
Index Terms - data mining, association rules mining, frequent patterns mining, pattern growth, share-inherit I  I NTRODUCTION   Recently, data mining has received a great amount of attention in database research. The attention is motivated by the large amount of data generated by business in their day to 
  
day operation. For instance, supermarkets store electronic records of millions of receipts, banks and credit card companies maintain extensive transaction records, and many factories collect a lot of flow parameters. The goal in data mining is to analyze these large amounts of data and discover patterns, rules, and trends that are useful for decision support Mining association rules, an important subfield of data mining, was firstly introduced by Agrawa o f a r  most of the research has been focused on designing fast algorithms for it [2-16, 19T h e pro b l e m o f  m i ni ng  al l  association rules can be decomposed into two sub problems First, frequent patterns, all patterns that have support above a minimum support threshold defined by the user, are mined 
Second, rules are generated based on the frequent patterns already mined. Compared to the first problem, the solution for the second one is rather straightforw   According to many studies on mining association rules the algorithms for mining frequent patterns from databases can be separated into two classes, candidate set generation-andtest and pattern growth  Some of the previous studies, such as Ap  Partition [25 Sam p li n g 2 6  DIC [2 7  DHP [2 8  A p rio r iBrave [29 dopt t h e can di dat e s e t g e n e rat i o nan d t e s t  approach, which is based on an anti-monotone Apriori property i f any pat t e rn o f l e ng t h k i s n o t f requ e n t i n t h e database, its super-pattern of length \(k+1\ never be 
frequent. All algorithms using this property achieve good performance by reducing the size of candidate sets. However candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there are a large number of frequent patterns or long frequent patterns. On the other hand, it is expensive to repeatedly scan the database and check a large set of candidates through pattern matching, and this is especially true for mining long patterns  In contrast to a large amount of candidate set generation techniques, the pattern growth algorithms, such as FP-Growth  P 4  T D F P G ro w t h 5], C T I T L 7], HMin e 8 do not need to generate candidates due to their complex hyper structures \(data storage structures used in pattern growth 
algorithms\ [17 A t t h e sa m e ti m e, t h e p atter n  g r o w t h  m et h o d  is based on a divide-and-conquer method. It recursively splits the database into sub-databases according to the frequent patterns found and searches for local frequent patterns to assemble longer global ones \(i.e. the mining task is decomposed into a set of smaller tasks.\lmost all algorithms that adopt pattern growth achieve better performance than candidate set generation ones by rejecting candidate set generation, reducing the number of scanned original database and decomposing the whole mining process into smaller ones However, all such methods still encounter some performance bottlenecks, as the exclusive division of mining process will cause repeated traversal and computation 
 The main contribution of this paper is to present a novel data mining approach for mining frequent patterns in large databases. First, we propose a new data structure, Share-struct which is derived but obviously different from FP-tree. A Share-table is built instead of a Header table. Moreover, in Share-struct, a FP-tree is more condensed and stable. Second Share-tables are created dynamically in the mining process They are recycled to maintain the useful things from previous steps so that the following steps can share most of the results from previous computation. This is more significant than 


Fre is shown in the following Procedure exclusive divide-and-conquer pattern growth method. Third several optimization techniques incorporated with ShareInherit speed up the algorithm and save a lot of space. Finally share technique can be combined with the pattern growth approach, greatly improving performance efficiency  The experimental results show that the Share-Inherit algorithm not only outperforms previously algorithms but also improves them by incorporating Share-Inherit strategy  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background which formally states the problem and reviews the related work. Section 3 proposes the new data structure and algorithm. Examples and analysis are given at the same time. Section 4 presents the performance study and discussion. Finally, Section 5 lists the conclusion and the future work  II  B ACKGROUND  A. Problem statement  In this subsection, we introduce the definition of frequent pattern mining and show two typical approaches for this task  1\  Frequent patterns mining Let I={x 1 x 2 x 3 205 x n be a set of items. An itemset X also called a pattern, is a subset of I and is denoted by X Output c i local-count= c i local-count + c i count 4  Algorithm 1 i, m end  f, c, a, m o f, b, o 400 b, c, k, s c, b  1  TID Items Bou Call Share-struct-Construction 200 a, b, c, f, l, m, o f, c, a, b, m, l, o 300 b, f, h  t  Initialize S 100 f, a, c, d 004 f or each   Example 1 Table I shows the example transaction database  e t t h e m i n i m u m  su pport  t h resh ol d be 2   As only the frequent items will play a role in the frequent pattern mining, it is necessary to scan the DB once to identify the set of frequent items \(L 1 order to obtain high compactness, we order L1 in support descending order L 1 f:4, c:4, a:3, b:3, m:3, p:3, l:2, o:2}\Then, we scan the DB for a second time to construct the FP-tree. The construction algorithm of a FP-tree is proposed in FP-Growth  eaders are ref e rred to th e cited paper f o r details  TABLE I A TRANSACTION DATABASE AS RUNNING EXAMPLE   DB add c i to the relevant new field in S  3  S S sort items in L 1 in support descending order 3  l   The FP-tree in a Share-struct is almost the same as the one in FP-Growth cept f o r each n o te 222 s parent an d nex t  fields. They are redundant in Share-struct, so they are child c i of new/old call Initialize Initialize Share-struct-Construction   The procedure uent Items a database, DB, and a minimum support threshold  Procedure S new, old 1  Method create a FP-tree, T parent and next fields are removed 4  a Share-struct, S L 1 The set of all frequent items 2  Input m, n f, c, a, m do begin  2  g h  q g p p  j p p  500 a, f, c, e, l p p DB DB Ordered  T  002 I A transaction T X TID, X\air, where X is a pattern and TID is its unique identifier. A transaction T X is said to contain T Y if and only if Y 002 X. A transaction database, named DB, is a set of transactions. The number of transactions in DB that contain X is called the support of X. A pattern X is a frequent pattern, if and only if its support is larger than or equal to s where s is a threshold called minimum support. The problem of frequent patterns mining is to find the complete set of frequent patterns in a given transaction database with respect to a certain support threshold s  2\  Candidate set generation approach  This approach is based on the anti-monotone Apriori property: if any pattern of length k is not frequent in the database, its super-pattern of length \(k+1\ never be frequent. Namely, all subsets of a frequent pattern must be frequent. The essential idea is to iteratively generate the set of candidate patterns of length \(k+1\rom the set of frequent patterns of length k \(k 1\d then scan the database once to check their corresponding occurrence frequencies  3\ Pattern growth approach  In contrast to the candidate set generation technique pattern growth approach eliminates the need for candidate set generation according to the frequent patterns found and searches for local frequent patterns to assemble longer global ones. By projecting the database into a more compressed hyper structure that fits within the memory, it does not need to scan a database multiple times  III  S HARE I NHERIT ALGORITHM FOR MINING FREQUENT PATTERNS   In this section, we first present the definition of Sharestruct, upon which Share-Inherit is based. At the same time we give an example of constructing a Share-struct. Then, we will propose the Share-Inherit algorithm for mining the complete set of frequent patterns and give the analysis A Share-struct: Design and construction  1\sists of a FP-tree and Share-tables  2\ node in the FP-tree of Share-struct, the link fields for parent and next are redundant, so they are removed to save space, and once the tree is built, it will never be changed during the whole mining process, making the FP-tree more compressed and stable  3\ entry in a Share-table consists of four fields item-name, local-count, new, and old, where item-name represents an item, local-count records the local support of an item in a given prefix, new field links the nodes not considered in the tree, and old field points to the nodes traversed or a Share-table constructed  Based on the definition mentioned above, we have the following Share-struct construction algorithm 003 004 003 004 003 004 004 Share-struct-Construction

We compare SI with some previous known algorithms, such as FP-Growth 4], an d C T I T L 7  The experiments are based on a 2.4GMHz Pentium IV PC with 512MB main memory and 60 GB hard driver, running on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. All the programs are written in Microsoft/Visual C++6.0  A Datasets and characteristics  The basic characteristics of datasets used in our experiments are listed in Table II. The Chess dataset is derived from the steps of chess games. Each transaction in Connect contains legal 8-ply positions in the connect game where no player wins and the next move is not forced. All of them are derived from Irvine Machine Learning Database Repository Pumsb* contains census data PUMS \(Public Use Microdata Samples\. Each transaction represents the results of a census questionnaire, including the age, tax-filing status, marital status, income, gender, veteran status, and location of respondent\222s residence. In Pumsb* all items with 80% or more support in the original PUMS dataset are deleted B. Experimental results  In this subsection, we compare the performance of ShareInherit with FP-Growth, OP, and CT-ITL. The measured performance is algorithms\222 execution time on the datasets with different minimum support threshold. The execution time only includes the disk reading time \(scan datasets\d CPU time not disk writing time \(output frequent patterns\ is enough to reduce the influence of different speed of disk writing  Figure 2 through 5 show the performance curves of the four algorithms on three datasets respectively. We can see that the Share-Inherit algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms on all datasets  On Chess, SI is superior to other three algorithms. When the support threshold decreases less than 60%, there is tremendous gap of the performance. When the support threshold is as low as 35%, SI requires only 11 seconds whereas OP, FP-Growth, CT-ITL require 67, 97 and 145 seconds respectively. Fig. 2 shows that the ranking of algorithms on Chess is SI > OP > FP-Growth > CT-ITL  As shown in Fig. 3, on Connect, the algorithms\222 ranking is also SI > OP > FP-Growth > CT-ITL. The execution time of OP and FP-Growth are basically the same, but shorter than CT-ITL. SI is much better than the other three algorithms, and the performance gap becomes significant when the minimum support threshold drops below 60%. For example, SI uses 70 seconds at the support level of 35%, while OP, FP-Growth and CT-ITL finish in 193, 233 and 373 seconds respectively  For the Pumsb*, Fig. 4 shows that the execution time of CT-ITL and FP-Growth are in the same order. SI and OP have almost the same execution time, but less than CT-ITL and FPGrowth. When the support threshold is over 22.5%, SI outperforms other three algorithms. However, SI is inferior to OP if the support threshold is less than or equal to 22.5%. The reason is as follows: SI is not good at dealing with many global frequent items. When the support threshold is 22.5% on Pumsb*, there are 81 global frequent items. They result in a lot of long Share-tables which are shared by few frequent patterns  To improve the performance, we take the hybrid strategy for SI and other algorithms. For example, we improve the OP by incorporating SI in. Fig. 5 shows the execution time of SI OP and SI&OP with the support threshold between 20% and 21%. We can see that SI improves the OP by incorporating Share-Inherit strategy in it TABLE II T HE CHARACTERISTICS OF TEST DATASETS  20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140                                                      SI OP FP-Growth CT-ITL Time \(Seconds Support threshod Connect 67,557 129 43 Pumsb* 49,046 2,087 50

Discussion  As shown in figure 2 through 5, on several typical datasets and support levels, Share and Inherit approach makes Share-Inherit algorithm outperform other algorithms which adopts an absolute divide-and-rule pattern growth approach The Share-tables maintain the useful information for the following mining processes, which dramatically reduce the need for traversing FP-tree. Although Share-Inherit algorithm is not good when the number of global frequent items is significantly higher, hybrid techniques can be easily incorporated V  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK   We have proposed a new data structure, Share-struct which is derived but obviously different from FP-tree. It is used for storing compressed information about frequent patterns. Then we developed an algorithm, Share-Inherit, for efficiently mining frequent patterns  There are several advantages of Share-Inherit over other algorithms: \(1\ses Share-Inherit strategy to maintain useful information for the following mining processes, so repeated traversals on FP-tree are largely reduced. \(2\ It exponentially generates frequent patterns, which also avoids costly candidate set generation and test. \(3\ It gives a way to improve all algorithms which adopt the pattern growth approach  We have implemented the Share-Inherit algorithm studied its performance in comparison with several wellknown algorithms in several databases. The experimental results show that Share-Inherit algorithm performs better than the existing algorithms  Recently, there have been some interesting studies about mining frequent patterns in databases which allow adding new data or deleting old data. The extension of the Share-Inherit technique, for maintenance of the already mined frequent patterns when updating databases, is an interesting topic for future research A CKNOWLEDGMENT   We would like to express our thanks to Nula, Qian Dong and Ji Qi for providing us some useful suggestions R EFERENCES   R  A gra w a l R  S r ik an t F a s t a l gori t hm s for m i n i n g a s s o c i at i o n ru les  in   Proc.

future works aim at extending the strengthening semantics to other types of fuzzy graduality in particular expressed by certainty rules More generally extensions to other types of rules such as association rules or non fuzzy gradual rules are to be examined They would provide a way to extract contextual information i.e rules that do not aply to the whole data but only to data subsets R EFERENCES  B  B ouchon-M e unier and S  D espr  es Acquisition num erique  symbolique de connaissances graduelles in 3 emes Journ ees Nationales du PRC Intelligence ArtiÞcielle Herm es 1990 pp 127Ð138  D  D ubois a nd H  P r ade Gr a dual i nfer ence r u les in appr o x im ate reasoning Information Sciences  vol 61 no 1-2 pp 103Ð122 1992  E  H  ullermeier Implication-based fuzzy association rules in Proc of PKDDÕ01  2001 pp 241Ð252  S  G alichet D  D ubois  and H  P r a de  I m pr ecis e s peci cation o f illknown functions using gradual rules Int Journal of Approximate Reasoning  vol 35 no 3 pp 205Ð222 2004  E  H  ullermeier Association rules for expressing gradual dependencies in Proc of PKDDÕ02  2002 pp 200Ð211  F  B er zal J  C C uber o  D  S anchez M  A  V ila and J  M  S er r a no An alternative approach to discover gradual dependencies Int Journal of Uncertainty Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems  vol 15 no 5 pp 559Ð570 2007  L  D i J or io A  L aur e nt a nd M  T eis s eir e F as t e xtr acti on of gr adual association rules A heuristic based method in Proc of CSTSTÕ08  2008   M ining f r e quent gr adual item s ets fr om lar ge databa s es   in Proc of IDAÕ09  2009  A  L aur e nt M  J L e sot and M  R ifqi  Gr aank E xploiting r a nk correlations for extracting gradual dependencies in Proc of FQASÕ09  2009  P  L e nca B  V aillant P  M e yer  and S  L allich  A s s o ci ation r ule interestingness measures Experimental and theoretical studies in Quality Measures in Data Mining  F Guillet and H J Hamilton Eds Springer 2007 vol 43 pp 51Ð76  S  Br in R  M otw a ni a nd C S ilv er s tein  Be yond m a r k et bas k ets  Generalizing association rules to correlations in Proc of the ACM SIGMOD/PODS 97 Joint Conference  1997 pp 265Ð276

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
