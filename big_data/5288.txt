This development is a big step in way to prove that push recovery is a software engineering problem and not hardware engineering problem The walking algorithm used here aims to select a subset of push recovery problem i.e. disturbance from environment. We applied the physics at each joint of Halo with some degree of freedom The proposed model, Halo is different from other models as previously developed model were inconsistent with data for different persons. This would lead to development of the generalized biped model in future and will bridge the gap 
between performance and inconsistency. In this paper the proposed model is applied to data of different persons. Accuracy of model, performance and result is measured using the behavior negotiation capability of model developed. In order to improve the performance, proposed model gives the freedom to handle each joint independently based on the belongingness value for each joint. The development can be considered as important development for future world of robotics. The accuracy of model is 70% in one go. In this paper, we achieve to imitate the human gait cycle for HOAP-2 [2 o ts m o d e l H a l o   W e  val i d ate o u r  model by giving different input configuration parameter i.e

Human motion capturing device \(HMCD [3    I  I NTRODUCTION   Push recovery is the behaviour shown by any subject towards recovery from unexpected external push. Human Push recovery capability is a learning process which human being learns through a continuous evolution 
 process. Our two most sophisticated parts of central nervous system, right lobe and left lobe are used to control and recover from particular push So it is one of the most frequent and quick decision taken by humans during normal walking. The problem occurs when robot is made to work in similar environments like humans Using LI e d bi p e d m odel  w h i c h i s  i n h e rent l y  unstable and has serious stability problem but due to better adaptability, obstacle negotiation capability and stairs climbing capability we are using biped model. We as human prefer to learn through continuous learning by negotiating with environment and by effectively using different strategy to impart human learning robot so we are using fuzzy logic based controller which counters impreciseness of environment

The major benefit of using fuzzy model is to achieve low cost and more intuitive model Fuzzy model as a tool is easily understandable by human i.e. it has sort of knowledge representation for better human understandability.

To impart learning for push recovery it follows the process like human body follow.

Finally we concluded the push recovery not only depend push recovery not only depends on the person\222s height, weight or sex but also depends on whether a person is a left or right handed 18  T h e se si m u la tio n s are a b i g leap in th e f u rt h e r investigation and development step of real biped humanoid robot which will be synergistically similar with the human e ot h e r relevan t an d recent w o r k s i n t h e a r ea  of humanoid push recovery can be obtained in  II  H UMANOID O PEN A RCHITECTURE P LATFORM R OBOT  The HOAPs on e of  t h e bi ped robot s of H O A P series, developed by Fujitsu for commercial use. It is very much popular between research community due to resemblance with the human with more DoF and mobility The architectural details are given in manu h e DoF which is actually defining the number of parameter to defined the all joint configuration which help us to analyze the problem of push recovery   Fig 1: Degree of freedom of Halo  II  O UR A PPROACH  A  The Step of methodology    The objective of this paper is to describe the model which can perform the human like Gait cycle and analyze the behavior using hierarchical fuzzy algorithm, control the balance of lateral plane movements of h u m a n o i d robot s  We t a k e n consideration of the HOAP m odel becau s e it is  resemble to human. We organized our methodology in the following steps  Step1:- To simulate the liner inverted pendulum equivalent biped model i.e. HOAP s i m i l a r m odel i n Webot s   A n d calibrate the all the part and joint with their respective physical parameter like degree of freedom, mass, centre of mass, height, length of body part etc  Step2:- To compute the control torques for the joints in a bipedal humanoid, change in angle of different joint, gait pattern taken from HMCD [3 s o f hu m a n a nd fi n a l l y calculate Inverse kinematic and D-H parameter of model  Step3:-Apply all the above calculated parameter to our model i.e. Halo and make it to follow the human gait cycle based on real time data captured through HMCD   Step4:-To gather the sufficient amount of data by our model to impart the learning technique  Step5:- To develop a hierarchical fuzzy module e d on  the data gather through indigenous developed suit HMCD  and associate same computing on Webots controller to guide the our model similar to HOAP2 [1 f o llo w  th e g a it c y cle and predict the output angle and velocity on the basis of input force and direction around our rule defined in paper    Biped which is human resembles inverted pendulum structure is inherently unstable and while interacting with human will ultimately collide with humans, things and other humanoids, So humanoid push and fall recovery is very important to make them absorb force and stand up after falling. In this paper we tried to address the issue of push recovery with referenced to the humanoid robot HOAP2 [1 The experimental data collected through in house developed HMCD device used in development of software based model Then to make it follow the human gait cycle, Inverse kinematic have been solved for its legs th e m odel als o  has been programmed to be visible dynamically. To make advance we involved the two infrared sensors on the eyes of biped to identify obstacle in the way. To make it free from intensive computation mechanism and impart learning we proposed the hierarchical fuzzy system a it c y cle s t y l e in which a human being walks. Gait cycle starts where one foot leaves the ground and end it again touches the groun    The control torques can be computed for the joints in a bipedal humanoid using the following equations       1   For normal walking pattern, torques can be generated as in eqn.\(1\hich is sum of inertial torque \(M\entrifugal and 


Coriolis torque\(C\d gravitational torque \(G\gether with some frictional torques which has been neglected. When external force is applied on human, these ideal walking patterns of different joint torques get disturbed. To regain original torques, control torques required to be applied [8     Fig2: Displaying the balance of CmP  Method resolving the present problem  Model Architecture   Fig3: Details Design of Model  Our model consists of a sphere surmounted on a cylinder attached with two limbs. Each Limb is equipped with total 4 servos, 2 servos at keen and 2 servo at ankle. The servo which is used at foot does not play any vital role to move the leg at any position but do keep orientation of the feel almost parallel to the ground in swing phase and stance phase of gait cycle  Inducing anthropomorphic logic into computers, though approximately, is very well handled with Fuzzy Control Designing system and subsequent changes is neatly done linguistic variables as compared with mathematical modeling It also come with additional advantages such as faster development cycles, precise control and easy to code and easy to understand programming. It is necessary to note that fuzzy logic and control make way for faster solutions which are in acceptable limits and surely are not comparable with high computational accuracy of classical mathematical techniques but this compromise is worthy in the sense that these problems cannot be fully represented through traditional models. If tried, resultant would be too complex having high computation cost along with ambiguity in data  Trajectory planning aimed to realize walking of our biped consists of two parts. One is swing trajectory, phase in which one leg is swinging in air kept in front of the other legs .Other part is body trajectory in which swinging leg complete its motion and is placed on ground, and body start moving  Inverses Kinematics results in the joint angles corresponding to specified location of end-effectors Kinematic equations derived for a serial manipulator are a set of polynomials result in multiple configurations for this manipulator of chain type. For parallel manipulators, the specification of location of the end-effectors has simple kinematics equations, yielding the joint parameters relationship [12    To accomplish this paper we created a database taking reading of numerous people. The data from HMCD, which would be simple, and reliable to capture the angle change of various joints of the body. Reason of using fuzzy logic is obvious and we can heuristically conclude that the gait pattern varies on parameters viz. sex, body weight \(heavy or light and state of mind \(relaxed or nervous; happy or sad etc can be argued that simple distance measure will never work precisely while on the other hand fuzzy classifier wills few notches higher We aim to create a GAIT cycle for various forms of locomotion like simple walking upgraded to brisk walking and then to running and other forms such as stair climbing. For normal and healthy persons the GAIT cycle generated can be used as an input to realize a biped [1   IV  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULT    The research shows some useful behavior of human being towards push recovery. The experimentally result using in house development proved that humans have preference for left and right legs analogous to left and right handedness[14  The strategy is different for left hander or right handed persons. The knee joint is very active in maintaining balance towards push. It gives great insight to develop a reactive controller for a bipedal humanoid robot to make robot model different from the architecture of plain robot, which robot is helpful in many real world interface like swimming robot or a flying robot. So, It is desirable to use the mass instead of the density so we set density =-1 mass =0.5 density in kilogram/cubic meter and mass in kilometer. When we specified density it ignored mass. The below mentioned table gives details about the various parameters used in our model  Parameter Geometrica l Structure Size\(meter\ Mass Kg Head Sphere Radius-.04 0 Body Cylinder Length-0.2 Radius-.008 3.8 Thigh\(Left& Cylinder Length-0.2, .735

With the help of D-H parameter, next link of the manipulator can fully described with respect to the previous link [20 1    Right ankle and left ankle of left handed person shows little involvement in balancing  This experiment shows a very different result that one side of human body is more active during push recovery i.e. for left hander person, his right leg joints are more active in push recovery pattern and vice versa Vital role has played by knee in balancing   ANALYSIS   The research exhibit the useful behavior for further development of push recovery based model of human being towards push recovery. The data collected by HCMD and research done in our previous c l u ded t h at l e f t  handed or right handed persons use different strategy for push recovery and specially the knee joint is too active during maintain the balance against push. Our developed model controller led for subsequently development of biped reactive controller  PERFORMANCE MEASURES  While dynamic models used a LIPM, which assume a point mass biped with fixed CoM value. We validate our method on the HOAP  which ha ve 2 5 DoF wi th multibody mass better flexibility to avoid obstacle and less singularity issue as compared to LIPM model        Fig 4: Snap Shot of three different phase of GAIT cycle perform by our model    Figure 5: LIBM image from frontal plane in Webots

Also it has universal approximation property parameters and measurement similar or close to HOAP-2[1 h is was done so as to lower down the complexity of the problem and make it easy to understand the governing reason for push recovery. The model developed in this direction is biped which has legs equipped with number of servos, enough to make it follow ankle and hip strategy as well. The data was gathered and the fuzzy module was developed which showed result with high accuracy. This model and the data gathered can help in further research in this direction of push recovery To add learning to the model and make it fast in response and remove computation a hierarchal fuzzy model was developed This is very close to that of actual synthetic data. We have concluded that bipedal push recovery is based on learning and controlled reactions and if we want to impart effective push recovery to a humanoid robot, we will have to understand that it is a software engineering problem rather than hardware controlled problem as envisioned earlier. This will lead to reach on consensus that push recovery is software problem  R EFERENCES  1  S. Shahid\202 A. Nandy\202 S. Mondal\202 M.

On one hand, this is necessary due to a lack of prior knowledge or prior models applicable to this problem. On the other hand, the heuristic knowledge, such as series distribution and customized tags lists, simplify the computations and the complexity of the processing workflow. Still, we think that using ER as a framework for data curation processes is a viable approach that can be generalized to other collections with additional learning methods to improve its robustness and effectiveness There is an important part missing from the work presented here, namely the scope of the results in relation to the entire collection. Understanding how complete is the representation provided by the distant processing is not yet possible because there is no suitable benchmark set Creating such a benchmark is not trivial, but is something we will strive for in future work In the future, we want to investigate what kind of results might be produced by further modifying the algorithm as a consequence of observations during the first clustering iteration evaluation and of the emergence of new requirements as the data are cleaned, reorganized, and filtered. We also plan to visualize the cluster review process including other metadata such as identical checksums, and file format identification that can help the curator validate his cluster evaluation and improve action decision making A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  Funding for this work was provided by grants from the National Archives and Records Administration and the Packard Humanities Institute R EFERENCES  1  R  S e rlen  Th e Di s t ant F u tu re?

to efìciently identify critical outliers Moreover S ONATA can monitor the behaviors of a jobês execution on-the-îy to facilitate online optimization while HiTune only offers post-execution performance analysis Starìsh is a self-tuning system that enables Hadoop users to get good performance automatically without deep understanding of many tuning knobs available 7  O ne of the key features of Starìsh is that it can automatically set the near-optimal parameters for Hadoop jobs However Starìsh mainly focuses on the tuning of the parameters of Hadoop framework which cannot be used to optimize the runtime engines and diagnose hardware problems In other words Starìsh cannot facilitate full-system optimization Theia 13 i s a vis u alization t ool to generate visual signatures of each jobês performance by analyzing the applicationlevel logs of a Hadoop cluster The visual signatures facilitate troubleshooting the performance problems e.g hardware failure data skew and software bugs etc on the cluster However Theia cannot tackle with misconìgurations of runtime engine and underlying hardware Hadoop vaidya is a rule-based performance diagnostic tool for MapReduce jobs 14 Al t hough i t can pro vi de recommendations based on the analysis of runtime statistics it cannot facilitate full-system optimization PerfXPlain is a system enables users to ask questions about the relative performances i.e runtimes of pairs of MapReduce jobs 15 Ho we v e r  t h i s s y s t em mai nl y focus es on e xpl ai ni ng the performance similarity or difference between pairs of MapReduce job or task executions In summary current approaches mainly target to the optimization of MapReduce parameters which cannot be helpful for full-system optimization In contrast by correlating different phases tasks and resources S ONATA is able to efìciently identify critical outliers for full-system optimization Besides the monitoring capability of S ONATA can facilitate the online optimization of MapReduce applications VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we present a correlation-based performance analysis approach to efìciently identify the critical outliers for full-system MapReduce optimization The key intuition is that the critical outliers can only be accurately and efìciently identiìed by correlating different phases tasks and hardware resources Once critical outliers are identiìed several empirical optimization rules can be deployed to tame them The proposed approach is further implemented as a tool named as S ONATA S ONATA has been deployed on IBM Platform Symphony TM  and experimental results show that it only causes less than 5 performance overhead for more than 2000 tasks on a 10-node PowerLinux TM 7R2 system Finally with the help of S ONATA  we manage to sort 1TB data in 7 minutes on this system running IBM Platform Symphony TM  A CKNOWLEDGEMENT We would like to thank H Peter Hofstee and Jian Li for sharing the cluster with us We also would like to thank Zane Hu Alicia Chin and Yonggang Hu for providing product supports R EFERENCES  J Dean and S  Ghema w a t  Mapreduce si mpl i  ed dat a processing on large clusters in Proceedings of OSDIê04  2004 pp 137Ö150   Apache hadoop  h ttp hadoop apache or g  Cloudera enterprise core  h ttp://www  c loudera com/content cloudera/en/products/cloudera-enterprise-core.html 4  Ib m i n f o s p h e re b i g i n s ig h t s  h ttp www-0 1  ib m.co m software/data/infosphere/biginsights  Ibm platform symphon y   h ttp://www-03 ibm com/systems technicalcomputing/platformcomputing/products/symphony 6 K  K ambat l a  A  P at hak and H P ucha T o w ar ds opt i m i z i n g hadoop provisioning in the cloud in Proceedings of HotCloudê09  2009 7 H  H er odot ou H L i m G L uo N B o r i so v  L  Dong F  B  Cetin and S Babu Starìsh A self-tuning system for big data analytics in Proceedings of CIDRê11  2011 pp 261 272 8 Z  R en X Xu J  W an W  S hi  and M Z hou W or kl oad characterization on a production hadoop cluster A case study on taobao in Proceedings of IISWCê12  2012 pp 3Ö13 9 P  W  F r e y a nd G Al onso Mi ni mi zi ng t h e h i dden cost of rdma in Proceedings of ICDCS 09  2009 pp 553Ö560 10 Gan g lia mo n ito rin g s y stem  h ttp g an g lia.so u r cefo r g e n et  G Anant hanar ayanan S  Kandul a A Gr eenber g I  S t oi ca Y Lu B Saha and E Harris Reining in the outliers in mapreduce clusters using mantri in Proceedings of OSDIê10  2010 pp 1Ö16  J Dai  J Huang S  Huang B  Huang and Y  L i u Hi t une dataîow-based performance analysis for big data cloud in Proceedings of ATCê11  2011 pp 7Ö20  E  G a r duno S  P  K a vul ya J T an R  G andhi  a nd P Narasimhan Theia visual signatures for problem diagnosis in large hadoop clusters in Proceedings of LISAê12  2012 pp 33Ö42  Hadoop v a idya  h ttp://hadoop apache or g/docs/stable/v aidya html  N Khoussai no v a  M  B al azi nska and D  S uci u   P e r f xpl ai n debugging mapreduce job performance Proc VLDB Endow  vol 5 no 7 pp 598Ö609 2012 761
