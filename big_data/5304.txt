one of the most important concerns in an online social network Online social network data is big data as millions of users are a part of it The personal information of every user in an online social network is an asset that may be traded by a third party for its bene\223ts Individuals should be aware of how much of their personal information could be shared without risk Different people have different requirements to share a pro\223le item hence measuring privacy of such huge and diverse population is a challenging and complicated task in itself In this paper we have proposed a framework that ensures privacy of individuals by allowing them to measure their privacy with respect to some speci\223c people of their choice rather than measuring it with the entire population on online social networks We have suggested a method to choose the best model to 223t the real world data and to calculate the sensitivities of various pro\223le items The framework gives speci\223c labels to users that indicates their pro\223le privacy strength and enable them to customize their privacy settings so as to improve the privacy quotient The users can also act as advisers to their online friends whose privacy quotients are low and thus spread privacy awareness in social networks customized privacy;privacy strength;item response theory Abstract Keywords I I NTRODUCTION Online Social Networks OSNs have become the most popular Internet service to be used to date It helps the users to stay connected with the world The users of OSNs lik e Facebook Twitter LinkedIn MySpace etc have increased exponentially in the recent years Using OSN people can interact with each other by sharing their personal information such as photos likes dislikes interests relationship status job details current town details political views religious views etc There is an information e xplosion in the quantity and diversity of high frequency online social network data This greatest advancement came with a price of privacy With so much of personally identi\223able information PII available online privacy concerns are bound to arise Our PII is an asset to many third parties and can be mined and utilized for bene\223ts People are unintentionally and intentionally sharing their personal details without understanding the cost that they are paying for it If personal data about individuals are collected processed stored and retrieved without their consent their privacy is under threat Exposure of one\220s private details can lead to identity theft market bene\223ts and embarrassment etc OSN users are not aware of their online privacy leaks They should know what and how much information they should share such that they are not at risk Privacy greatly depends upon the context What is private to a particular individual may not be private to others To measure a person\220s intelligence we need the intelligence quotient in the similar fashion to measure the privacy of the user we need to know and understand the privacy quotient PQ There has to be a privacy measuring scale in which the individuals can be ranked according to their PQs and should know where they stand in comparison to the rest of the world Calculating the privacy quotient for the entire social network population is a Big Data problem and a dif\223cult task to undertake The privacy requirements are a function of the demography of the users as well as the social ties they have Customizing the privacy settings of users by looking at such a diversi\223ed data does not really help because different people have different requirements and understanding of privacy which fetches them different privacy quotients Instead of measuring the privacy of the whole network our framework allows the users to measure the privacy with the user pro\223les of their choice which reduces the data set greatly Calculation of privacy quotient is analogous to the standard classical test theory We have used the existing privacy measuring models to formulate a framework to measure the privacy of the users in an OSN with respect to their circle in the OSN Our framework considers naive approach one parameter constrained and unconstrained data model and two parameter data model and selects the best model out of the four adaptive test models There are v arious approaches to measure the privacy of an online social networking user Every approach deals with a different model and every model may not necessarily 223t the real world data Selecting the best model out of all is an important step We have used the concept of Akaike Information Criterion AIC Bayesian Information Criterion BIC and log likelihood to select the suitable model After calculating the privacy quotient using a suitable model we have 223xed a range to the privacy quotient using the k means clustering algorithm and have labelled a strength to each of the range Understanding text is a lot easier than 2013 IEEE Recent Advances in

V E XPERIMENTAL S ETUP  We implement and run multiple graph algorithms including BC, PageRank and All-Pairs shortest path using our Pregel.NET BSP framework on the Microsoft Azure public cloud platform.  We use four real datasets   o f va r y ing siz e s th a t e x hib it sm a ll-w o r l d  pro p e r ties:  SlashDot \(SD\nd LiveJournal \(LJ\ social networks, a web graph from Google \(WG\, and a patent citation network \(CP\, whose statistics are shown in Table 1. Our implementation does not perform any aggressive memory management or compression of NET object representation of graphs; hence the sizes of graphs selected were conservative to fit available VM memory. However, these do not detract from the key benefits of the heuristics and the analysis of Pregel/BSP that we present empirically We use large Azure VM instances for all partition worker roles and small instances for web UI and manager roles since the latter just perform coordination Large VMs have 4-cores rated at 1.6GHz, 7GB RAM and 400Mbps network and cost $0.48/VM-Hour. Small ones are exactly a fourth of these specifications. These extents were chosen based on the Azure resources made available as part of a research grant, but the scalability trends can be extrapolated to larger numbers of VMs Given the time complexity of the BC algorithm, our large graph datasets can run for days or even weeks Thus, we perform a 4-hour run for each of our experiments and extrapolate these results to the entire graph VI E VALUATION OF B ASELINE AND H EURISTICS  Our Pregel.NET BSP framework can be used to implement and run a variety of graph applications on the Azure cloud. As a basic comparison, we implement PageRank, BC, and All-Pairs Shortest Path \(APSP\, and evaluated their performance with two graphs, WG and CP, using 8 worker VMs. The LJ graph would not fit within the available physical memory of the workers for BC and APSP due to the large numbers of messages that they generate during their traversal. LJ was however run for PageRank since it is a less demanding application Figure 2 shows the time taken \(log scale\ to run these applications for the graph sizes. As noted before, these times are extrapolated from running smaller sampling runs over a subset of the vertices. PageRank however was run to completion over 30 iterations. As can be seen, both BC and APSP take 4 orders of magnitude longer to complete than PageRank for the same graph sizes. BC and APSP are inherently superlinear in computational complexity compared to PageRank as they perform graph traversals rooted at every vertex while PageRank performs pairwise edge traversals from every vertex to its neighbors Further, if we consider the communication complexity of these applications using the BSP model, we notice that PageRank has a constant number of messages exchanged between workers across different supersteps Figure 3 shows a straight line at ~637,000 average messages exchanged by each of eight workers for the 30 supersteps required to complete PageRank for the WG graph, leading to a uniform performance profile and predictable resource usage. However, the messages transferred for BC and APSP over different supersteps has a triangle waveform pattern, which spikes to a peak of 4.7M and 3M messages respectively Ö just for a single swath of seven vertices and not for all vertices in the graph. The ramp up and down of messages over supersteps, and their repetitive nature as subsequent swaths of vertices are executed, leads to non-uniform resource usage, in particular, memory usage for buffering these messages between supersteps. The communication cost of message transfer also causes BC and APSP them to take much longer to complete than PageRank

baseline sampling heuristic adaptive heuristic 
The original Pregel/BSP approach of running all vertices in parallel can be detrimental to performance because of the memory demand for buffering messages across supersteps.  In fact, in a cloud setting, spilling to virtual memory can lead workers to seem unresponsive and the cloud fabric to restart the VM, as we have observed. This is particularly a concern for applications like BC and APSP that show a non-uniform resource usage pattern. For e.g., in Fig. 15 \(top\BC and APSP for the WG graph had to be run in small swaths of around 10 vertices as otherwise they would well surpass available memory during their peaking supersteps. Our swath size and initiation heuristics attempt to break vertex computations into a smaller number of swaths that are run iteratively to better control memory demand.  The alternative would require scaling up to 1000's of VM's to accommodate the memory demand As a we manually found the largest swath size we could successfully complete the BC application using 8 workers \(7GB memory each\or our WG and CP graphs while allowing them to spill to virtual memory \(40 and 25 swathe sizes, respectively\. Next we used our proposed swath size heuristics and to pick smaller swath sizes automatically and iteratively execute each swath for the same total number of vertices as the baseline single swath \(40 and 25\n both these heuristics the target maximum VM memory utilization threshold is conservatively set to 6GB since over-estimation can be punitive.  We ran these experiments using both 8 and 4 workers Figure 4 summarizes the relative performance gain of our swath size heuristics for performing BC on WG and CP graphs compared to the baseline approach that uses 8 workers. The sampling heuristic yields a speedup of nearly 2.5-3 versus the single large swath baseline while the dynamic heuristic yields a speedup of up to 3.5.  Figure 5 illustrates the corresponding physical memory usage during these executions. The baseline spills beyond available physical memory \(flat at 7GB the dynamic heuristic stays close to the target memory threshold of 6GB while the static heuristic stays close to it, but less often so. Intuitively This allows the adaptive

heuristic to execute BC on just 4 workers in roughly two-thirds the time as the baseline using 8 workers providing users with cost-performance tradeoffs in a pay-as-you-go cloud environment. The automation offered by the adaptive heuristic to the end user also eliminates the guesswork of picking a static baseline or any potential non-uniformity in sampling using the sampling heuristic C  Given the need to run computation as a series of smaller \(optimally sized\at hs, is important to decide when we initiate the next swath. Our initiation heuristics attempt to overlap execution of multiple swaths to flatten the resource \(memory, network, CPU\ usage variations causes by different supersteps within a single swath. In BC and APSP, we observe a triangle waveform with a central peak; this heuristic is not relevant for applications like PageRank with uniform resource usage. Besides improving resource utilization, overlapping consecutive swath iterations also reduce the cumulative supersteps required and thus reduces the total overhead spent on synchronization between supersteps Figure 6 compares the relative performance of our initiation heuristics for the BC application normalized to a baseline approach that runs strictly  non-overlapping iterations. These run on 8 workers Figure 7 shows the corresponding messages transferred between supersteps over time, spanning swath iterations. The initiates a new swath every supersteps while the  performs initiation when it detects a peak in the number of messages exchanged. Static-Nês performance depends on the graph and the value of that is chosen.  If the average shorte st path is greater than  we will be initiating new heur istics before the previous swath has hit its peak, thereby exacerbating the resource demand. If the average shortest path length is well distributed or is \(just\ shorter than it leads to better performance. So 4 for the larger CP graph actually works best. Our dynamic he uristic eliminates this guesswork as it picks the initiation point at runtime without user input or graph preprocessing. Using this dynamic initiation heuristic we achieve up to 24 speedup vs. sequential initiation for the WG graph. The message transfer plot in Figure 7 corroborates this While sequential shows the message transfers peak and fall to zero \(thus showing more variability and poorer utilization\, Static-6 \(which is optimal but handselected\ maintains a higher message rate while dynamic is a bit more conservative, but automated VII E VALUATING I MPACT OF G RAPH P ARTITIONING ON P REGEL NET Our Pregel.NET framework is agnostic to how the graphs are partitioned and assigned to workers. The default mode performs a simple hash over the vertex ID to determine the target worker partition. Several works have shown that intelligent graph partitioning can improve the performance of distributed graph algorithms [19  26 a nd i t is relevant to examine if these benefits carry over to the Pregel/BSP model also METIS is a commonly used strategy that provides good quality in-place partitioning that minimizes edge-cuts across partition  Rec e n t w o rk o n a p pr o x im ate partitioning using a single graph scan offers an alternative for partitioning online as the graph is read from storage P a ge R a nk is o f t e n used in l iter a tur e  to validate the effectiven ess of these partitioning strategies. However, as we have seen, PageRank implemented using Pregel/BSP has a uniform message profile while BC and APSP have a triangle waveform message profile. We analyze the consequence of this on the performance gains from intelligent graph partitioning Clearly, the benefit of partitioning comes in reduced communication time since messages to remote vertices incur additional delay due to serialization and network I/O when compared to in-memory messages sent to local vertices. Since many distributed graph algorithms are dominated by communication rather than computation, partitioning can improve overall performance However, the barrier synchronization model in Pregel/BSP means that the total time spent in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in the superstep. Hence, the balance of work amongst workers in a superstep is as import ant as the cumulative number of remote messages generated in a superstep. Since vertices communicate with their neighbors along edges in the Pregel/BSP model and partitioning seeks to collocate a majority vertex neighbors in the same partition, there may arise çlocal maximasé in specific partitions where more vertices are active during the course of execution of a graph application. This difference in workload can cause underutilization of workers that wait for over utilized workers at the superstep barrier

We evaluate the impact of graph partitioning using the best-in-class METIS partitioner as well as the best heuristic \(linear-wei ghted deterministic, greedy approach partitioner from [26 an d com p a r e  them against a baseline that uses simple of vertices by their IDs. We run PageRank, BC and APSP over the WG and CP graphs on 8 workers for this evaluation. Hash, METIS, and Streaming produce 8 partitions whose percentage of remote edges are 87 18% and 35% for the WG graph and 86%, 17% and 65% for the CP graph; smaller this number, lower the edge cuts across partitions, and METIS proves a low edge cut for both graphs. Given the large sizes of the graphs, we run these experiments on the same set of vertices as our other experiments \(50 vertices for CP and 75 vertices for WG\. We report these results when using Pregel.NET without our swath heuristics however, the trends we observe are consistent even with heuristics turned on, though the absolute performance is uniformly better Figure 8 shows the relative time taken when using the METIS and streaming partitioning normalized to hashing for PageRank, BC and APSP running on WG and CP. We see that the WG graph sees a relative improvement of nearly 42-50% for METIS for the three applications, while this improvement drops to 24-35 for the streaming partitioning. When running Pregel.NET with heuristics turn ed on, we see a best case improvement of 5x in relative time taken by METIS for BC on WG compared to hashing \(graph not shown These are consistent with results reported in  However, we also see that the CP graph does not show such a marked improvement in performance due to better partitioning, despite its edge cut ratios from different partitioning being similar to WG. In fact hashing is faster than METIS and Streaming for APSP on this graph. It is worthwhile to investigate this consistent lack of improvement for the CP graph as opposed to WG. Figure 9 shows the runtime for BC broken into compute+I/O time and the synchronization barrier wait time components for the WG graph and Figure 12 does the same for CP. The plots also show the VM utilization %, calcul ated as the time spent in compute and I/O communication against the total time including barrier wait time\ on the secondary Y-axis We see that the VM utilization % for hashing is higher though the total time taken is also higher, for both WG and CP. METIS shows the inverse property, having lower utilization but also lower total time. This is explained by looking at the number of messages emitted by workers in a supe rstep for both hashing and METIS, shown in Figures 10 and 11 for WG, and in Figures 13 and 14 for CP. We expect that a hashed assignment of vertices to a partition would spread communication roughly evenly over all workers, while also increasing the number of remote communications required. The latter contributes to the increased total time while the former leads to a uniform number of

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even çgoodé partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity Ö the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the cloudês elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPês synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and Öin at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an çoracleé approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workerês time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling.

dynamically scaling ideal scaling 
Our hypothesis is that an intelligent adaptive scaling of workers can achieve a similar performance as a large, fixed number of workers, but with reduced cost

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts
