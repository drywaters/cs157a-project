Emails, blogs, photos videos, and geographic datasets have been generated every day by possibly anyone with access to necessary technologies These data are also widely disseminated over the Internet through websites such as Twitter Flickr Youtube and OpenStreetMap. For the first time in history, people are able to collect vast volumes of data on various aspects of human life from conversations about mundane chores of daily life and fluctuation of emotions to discussions on major scientific breakthroughs and debate on critical political decisions. Many large online datasets do not only record stories of celebrities as in the old times, but also lives of ordinary people. According to a recent survey conducted by an Internet security company AVG 92 of babies in the U.S have an online presence before they reach the age of two in the form of an email a social network profile, spatial footprints, and so on. The large volumes of data are referred to as big data which provide a great potential to study the complex systems of human life on a large number of people en-US VGI one specific type of user generated content with a spatial element is a new source of geographic data that are produced by citizens using geospatial technologies including GPS units and Web 2.0 for data collection and distribution One famous VGI project is OpenStreetMap OSM with the goal of creating a free editable map of the whole world The data contributed to the OSM database have been proved very useful in many applications especially for some areas of the world that lack adequate geographic data For example when the Haiti Earthquake happened in 2010 there was almost no appropriate geographic information for Portau Prince. Within only 48 hours after the earthquake, contributors from all over the world used the OSM platform to produce a possibly most accurate and complete map of Portau Prince, which was later used for rescue efforts on the ground. Geographic information produced and disseminated through social media and social networking services has also been used for emergency response and management [12,13   en-US In addition to geographic information that is deliberately created by volunteers with some geographic purpose in mind there is another type of geographic information that is recorded as digital spatial footprints 14   Dig i tal  s p at ial  f o o tp r in ts  a r e  traces of locations left by people when they move around the  location-based services in a digital form. These footprints could be locations associated with tweets in Twitter or places attached to photos uploaded to Flickr The digital locations reveal places a person has visited and even the time spent in each place Some location-based services such as Google Latitude, even allow people to be located by others in real time One major motivation to disclose location information is to share stories with family and friends and to find local people with common interests. While some people may be reluctant to share locations with the general public, a substantial number of people do so en-US IV  LOCATION DISCLOSURE IN GEOREFERNCED TWEE TS  en-US Most social networking services give users the choices to turn on or off the location. For people who leave the location option on, some are willing to share their whereabouts with the world, while others may not be aware of their locations being visible to others In this study we used georeferenced tweets   en-US A  Data en-US The data were col  stored in a MySQL database We collected all georeferenced tweets within the bounding box of Los Angeles \(LA\ County in California USA between January 21 and March 7 2011 In total there were 506,016 georeferenced tweets generated by 24,369 users. Information associated with each tweet includes tweet ID, tweet text, tweet time, tweet location, and user ID as shown in Fig 1 tweet ID and user ID are not displayed to avoid identification of individuals en-US  en-US Figure1  Sample georeferenced tweets within LA County en-US To study patterns of spatial footprints contributed by individual users, we grouped georeferenced tweets by user ID As displayed in Fig 2 the number of georeferenced tweets created by different users produces the long tail effect most 


en-US georeferenced tweets were generated by a small number of people Among all users the number of georeferenced tweets ranges from 1 to 5039 Table 1 demonstrates the top 5 users who generated most georeferenced tweets in our database en-US  en-US Figure2  Number of georeferenced tweets generated by the top 1000 users en-US TABLE I  TOP 5 USERS WHO GENERATED MOST GEOREFERENCED TWEETS  en-US User rank  en-US Number of georeferenced tweets  en-US 1  en-US 5039  en-US 2  en-US 3475  en-US 3  en-US 3268  en-US 4  en-US 3099  en-US 5  en-US 2601  en-US  en-US B  Disclosed home and work locations en-US In order to infer home and work locations of individual users we linked the georeferenced tweets with land use data provided by Southern California Association of Governments SCAG Land use data in LA contain use code at the parcel level There are several major categories of land use vacant land single family residence multiple dwelling commercial industrial, agricultural, exempt property, natural resources, and miscellaneous property Under each major category there are several sub-categories of land use The georeferenced tweets generated by the top 5 users were extracted from the dataset and joined with the land use data. For each user, the number of georeferenced tweets located in each parcel was counted. The parcel with the largest number of tweets was regarded as a main location of user activities Then the land use code was used to differentiate between home and workplace For the 5 users a large number of tweets were generated from a single parcel and nearby parcels due to positional uncertainty The percentage of tweets and land use in the parcel with most georeferenced tweets for each user is shown in Table 2 Although the percentage varies from 32.83 to 73.07 four users created most tweets in a residential parcel and one user created most tweets in a commercial parcel Furthermore the time period associated with the georeferenced tweets contained in the parcel spanned across several days For example the georeferenced tweets created in one residential parcel by the first user were generated from 4:54am on January 21, 2011 to 1:18pm on March 5 2011 This result indicates that these parcels are probably the home locations for four of the five users, and work location for one. Fig. 3 demonstrates the tweet locations on top of a base map for the first user. This user had a wide coverage of tweet locations Fig 3a but most tweets were clustered around a single family house \(Fig. 3b en-US TABLE II  P ERCENTAGE OF GEOREFERENCED TWEETS AND LAND USE IN THE PARCEL WITH MOST TWEETS FOR THE TOP 5 USERS  en-US  en-US  en-US a en-US  en-US b en-US Figure3  Georeferenced tweets for the first user en-US a\  all tweet locations on top of the bing imagery en-US b\ tweets clustered in a residential parcel \(street names are blurred to avoid exact identification of location en-US V  CHANGED PERCEPTION OF PRIVACY  en-US As shown in the examples above we can infer home and work locations of individuals using georeferenced tweets and auxiliary land use data Although georeferenced tweets represent approximately only 1 of all tweets some users share substantial amounts of activity locations and daily en-US User rank  en-US Percentage of georeferenced tweets in the parcel  en-US Land use of the parcel  en-US 1  en-US 73.07  en-US Single family residence  en-US 2  en-US 35.39  en-US Apartment complex  en-US 3  en-US 50.70  en-US Combination Stores and Offices  en-US 4  en-US 32.83  en-US Apartment complex  en-US 5  en-US 54.52  en-US Apartment complex  


en-US trajectories. There may be two possible reasons. First, they are not aware of the type of geopersonal information they give out by tweeting with locations For some location-based services users must opt out of location visibility By default current location is automatically recorded in the database and shared with the public If these users are aware of the disclosure of their home locations and possible uses of their georeferenced tweets, they may turn off the location option to protect privacy Second users who share spatial footprints understand the possibility of revealing their locations. However, their level of concern about geographic privacy is low. As on some personal websites and blogs, people explicitly list their home addresses and cell phone numbers en-US Although disclosure of sensitive personal information, such as bank accounts and credit cards is always a concern for online security people may be less worried about their geopersonal information: location of their presence, their home and workplace On the other hand users sometimes have to give out some personal information to take advantage of the convenience and efficiency of information and communication  locations, but cell phone companies constantly collect location information from phone users Whenever a credit card is swiped the credit card company immediately knows the location of card user. When using Google Maps to search for Points of Interest POIs or to find direction between two places people give out their locations to Google Home location may no longer be a secret Location information contributed by millions of people has been collected and used to predict real-time traffic for route suggestions In an increasingly interconnected society it is difficult or even disadvantageous not to share some type of geopersonal information. Since the 1990s, GIS critics have expressed their concern over privacy issues associated with the use of geospatial technologies In the era of big data when many people are willing to share geographic information when using location-based services the content of geoprivacy may be redefined, and location sharing is a choice en-US VI  CONCLUSIONS  en-US Geographic information has been proved essential for performing many spatial tasks but privacy issues in the use geospatial technologies have been a concern Laws and regulations are enforced by government agencies to ensure privacy protection before geographic data are released to the public To protect geoprivacy and to preserve spatial patterns of original data geographic masking techniques were developed It may be relatively easy to control release of geographic data by the government, but it is almost impossible to regulate every piece of geographic information that is distributed over the Internet In this paper we inferred home and work locations from georeferenced tweets generated by users in Los Angeles County of California USA When substantial amounts of georeferenced tweets are generated by a user across an extended period of time, it is possible to identify his or her home or work location with the aid of land use data When tweet locations are overlayed with a satellite image, it is even clearer that most tweets by the same user were created around a house an apartment or a workplace It would be useful to further study why people share their locational information of daily trajectories If they are not aware of the disclosure of locations and possible uses of such data new design of social media and location-based services may be required to protect geopersonal privacy On the other hand when fully informed of possible location revelation people may still decide to share locations for the sake of gained benefits from such disclosure in which case sharing of geopersonal information is a choice, not privacy violation en-US R EFERENCES  en-US 1  Cromley E K  McLafferty S L 2011 GIS and public health Guilford Press en-US 2  Chainey, S., & Ratcliffe, J. \(2005\.

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
