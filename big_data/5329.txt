been always the research emphasis in many applications in the near 20 years Especially with the coming of the big data era its efìciency plays a critical role Although there are many research results for this issue they all reach a scalability bottleneck In this paper we propose an index structure utilizing community center i.e to select a group of vertices from the original graph and construct a subgraph With this subgraph we can answer reachability queries rapidly The experimental result shows that our approach is superior to the-state-of-the-art algorithms including construction time index size and query time Keywords Reachability query Community center Reachability

I I NTRODUCTION In recent year we can commonly nd that data is modeled as graphs in many applications e.g social networks semantic web bioinformatics and so on For instance in social networks we can use vertices to denote every user and use the edges to denote the relationship between the users Among all the algorithms involved with graphs reachability query which test if one vertex can reach another vertex via a path is one of the most fundamental issues Although it is a quite simple problem and has been researched for 20 years the efìciency is still a bottleneck Especially with the coming of big data era many new challenges are posed to this question 
A lot of approaches have been proposed to improve the query efìciency for graphs These methods mainly try to construct compact indexes of original graphs to achieve a balance between query time index size and constructing time However with the aggrandizement scale of graph data they all have problems in scalability For example the active user number of Facebook has reached 1 billion in August 2012 Faced with this tsunami of data the cost of index size and construction time of current methods is excessive expense The query time of online BFS Breadth First Depth First Search is liner related to graph size which is unacceptable for large graphs To sum up scalability has become the main obstacle for 
reachability query The big question now is whether we can construct indices efìciently when the graph data scale reach tens or even hundreds of millions of vertices In this paper we propose a new community-center-based index structure To achieve reasonable index size and answer query efìciently we rst divide the original graph into several independent communities Each community has a unique center and we use these centers instead of all the vertices to construct index Because the number of these vertices is much smaller than the total vertex number of the original graphs the index size can be signiìcantly reduced Our approach can not only handle medium-sized graphs but also scales extremely well for large 
At present most index algorithm need to preserve the whole vertices information It is the main reason why they have problems in scalability A sensible solution is to select a few vertices from the original graph to construct index Then the bottleneck of previous approaches would be broken and largescale even super-large-scale graphs can be handled efìciently Ruoming Jin et al proposed SCARAB a backbone-based method to construct reachability index They exact a small number of vertices to cover the original graph Every vertex can reach at least one backbone vertex in

steps In this way the storage cost can be reduced greatly However this method need to test repeatedly every vertex of the original graph while constructing the backbone This leads to high cost of time especially for those dense graphs In order to meet these challenges we draw lessons from SCARAB and put forward an index construction method which utilizes community center to cover the graph Its basic idea can be summarized as follows 
Social network is a long-standing issue in sociology and many interesting phenomena are found such as small world phenomenon power-law distribution and so on We can nd that in the vast majority of social networks or other similar

networks all the vertices have close connection with a small amount of vertices and are weakly associated with other vertices For instance in Facebook all users are in different group organized by affection politics or hobbies This kind of group can be called a community In each community there often exist several vertices called community centers which closely link to other vertices in a direct or indirect way Therefore we can link these community centers by virtual edges to form a reachability trunk It can be considered as a query subgraph of the original graph and the total index storage cost can be reduced greatly

Due to using a small proportion of the original graph to construct index other vertices need to do local search to quickly nd their nearest centers However because the distance between every vertex and their center is very short the cost of this operation is almost negligible Our method is similar to SCARAB which can also be used recursively to further reduce the index size Section 2 deìnes the problem and the basic notations Section 3 gives a heuristic algorithm to nd the reachability trunk Section 4 includes the query processing algorithm and the complexity analysis Section 5 reports the experimental results Section 6 and 7 give the related work and the conclusion II D EFINITION We rst give the notations used throughout the paper Intuitively the reachability trunk should have the features as follows Its size must be much smaller than that of the original graph It must reserve the topological structure of the original graph Each vertices in the original graph must reach one of its vertex quickly and easily in a few steps In order to meet them we explicitly separate internal vertex pairs from external vertex pairs and focus on utilizing the trunk for recovering the reachability for external reachable pairs To distinguish the two vertex pairs we deìne a threshold  For any pair of vertices u and v if two vertices can reach the same trunk vertex in steps then u,v can be called the internal-pair else they can be called the external-pair Therefore the reachability trunk can be deìned as follows Given a directed acyclic graph DAG and a threshold  its reachability is  where and may contain edges not in E then it has the following features Any two vertices in must not be in the same community All the vertices which is in the same community can reach its center in steps For any internal-pair u,v if u can reach v then the max distance between them is 2  For any external-pair u,v if u can reach v then there must exist and  such that and are both internal-pair and can reach  Figure 1\(b shows a reachability trunk of graph G gure 1\(a with  As an example for external-pair 1,14 there is a trunk vertex 0 where vertex 1 can reach in 1 hop there is another trunk vertex 7 where vertex 7 can reach 14 in 3 hops and vertex 0 can reach 7 in the reachability trunk Actually for any external-pair we can always nd their corresponding community center and test their reacnability by these trunk vertices  As is shown in the experimental result Section 5 for any real and synthetic graph data a reachability trunk with can dramatically reduce the size of the original graph And in many instances we can get an ideal result with  The main purpose of the reachability trunk is to cover the original graph with as few vertices as possible Here we give the deìnition of the minimum reachability trunk discovery Minimum Reachability Trunk MRT Discovery Given a DAG G=\(V,E and a threshold  there must be a vertex set which can cover G in hops and in all the possible candidate sets its size is the smallest However computing the MRT is NP-hard because its corresponding decision problem is an NP-complete problem Given a DAG G=\(V,E and a threshold  the MRT discovery problem is an NP-hard optimization problem The MRT discovery problem can be to the classic vertex set cover VSC problem a well-known NP-complete problem Given a DAG G=\(V,E theorem 1 can be proofed as follows 1 Suppose there is a solution that meets the VSC problem then for all  they must be covered by one and only one  2 Suppose there is a solution that meets the MRT problem then for any two vertex  they can not cover the same  In summary the MRT problem can be reduced to the VSC problem an NP-hard problem III R EACHABILITY T RUNK D ISCOVERY Known from the theorem 1 the reachability trunk cannot be computed in polynomial time Therefore we propose a maximum-degree-vertex covering rst heuristic algorithm Its basic idea is based on the following discoveries A community center usually connects closely with other vertices which shows that has a much larger degree than other normal vertices The graph partition problem is NP-hard too Obviously it is more efìcient if community centers are determined rst and then covering other neighbouring vertices

 Figure 15. Model Generation Execution Time Relationship with Dataset Length 5  Conclusion  This paper presents a high level look at some of the tools available in the Matlab toolset that enable the user to extract information from \223Big Data\224 sources in order to draw useful conclusions.  As described in Section II, the specific application discussed in this paper is the prediction of the amount of solar power generated by a micro-grid Section III then discusses the data that was gathered to support this exercise.  Section IV discusses the steps and techniques considered while trying to generate the best solar irradiance prediction model.  Techniques discussed included dataset sanitation, training input parameter selection, model generation via Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Rule Inference GENFIS3 Neural Network training using back propagation NFTOOL Pre-Processing nonlinear variables to add to the training data set, and the use of PCA to reduce the dimension of the training data while maximizing the information retained in the data set  It was observed in the results presented in Section IV that the best model predicting solar irradiance was one utilizing the maximum number of original and preprocessed variables, which was then reduced to a manageable dimension using PCA prior to use in training the model.  The results in this section also showed that the non-parametric model generation methods discussed in this paper performed significantly better than a sub-optimal predictor.  Finally, the results describing the model generation times for the two techniques showed that NFTOOL provides significantly better training times especially when the dimension of the dataset is high  Future work on this topic is planned to address the benefits of using Genetic Programming to optimally reduce the dimension of the dataset, the use of cloud computing to generate models for larger data sets, and the design and evaluation of a controller to buy or sell money from the grid based on demand and predictions of received solar energy References 1  M.
