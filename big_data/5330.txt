This paper introduces an incremental closed frequent itemsets mining algorithm, which is based on a shadow prefix tree to get closed frequent itemsets. By the use of shadow technology this algorithm can avoid the cost of generating and testing of candidate subsets. Shadow prefix tree can find nodes by virtual node without generating all nodes The experiment results show that th is algorithm can deal with big data more efficiently than others

DFCIM   NewMoment  is an incremental closed frequent itemsets mining algorithm, this algorithm uses bit vector to represent transaction database. A data structure like prefix tree is used to store critical data. But every item has a bit vector with fixed length in NewCet, when the dataset is scattered much space will be waste.   CFPL generates FPL structure from the preprocessing dataset   and gets the closed frequent itemsets by co mparing these signature vertex FPL is an algorithm dealing with vertical data structure, the waste of space will become obvious when the dataset is large AFOPT algorithm  generates a data structure  derived 
from prefix-tree\(PT\ining closed itemsets. This structure is a kind of ascending prefi x tree, but    it will generate much duplicate nodes, and the space has exponent relation to the number of items This page raises an incremen tal mining algorithm SPTCI\(Shadow Prefix Tree Closed frequent itemsets Incremental mining algorithm\ based on Shadow Prefix Tree\(SPT\by using the merging technology and shadowing technology on PT 001\012

Theorem1  then   Proof: Suppose there is T 1 D 11     T 1  and is inconsistent, so T 1 Lemma 1:Suppose the set of s ub nodes of SPT\(RN\(i\is SI     RN  RN      Conjunction function in unite process has two parameters SPT1  and SPT2.The action of conjunction function is to add the node count of sub nodes in SPT1 to node count of sub nodes in SPT2 and generate virtual at the right time. If a sub node N1 in SPT1  has a corresponding node N2 in SPT2 then add the node count of N1 to the node count of N2.If a sub node N1 in SPT1  has a corresponding node in SPT2 then generate a virtual node at the corresponding place in SPT2 The node label of the virtual node is the node label of N1 and the node point links to N1 Conjunction shadow prefix tree1:SPT1 shadow prefix tree2:SPT2 Begin SPT2.count=SPT2.co unt+SPT1.count For cSPT1=each children in SPT1 If\(SPT2 have a child cSPT2 and cSPT2.itemid=cSPT1.itemid Conjunction\(cSPT1,cSPT2 Else vn=new Virtual Node vn.link=SPT1 SPT2.children.add Virtual Node\(vn Continue to the previous sample,SPT\(RN\(AC\will conjunction with right C sub tree of SPT\(RN\(AB\he right C sub tree of SPT\(RN\(AB\\(RN\(ABC\ node count of RN\(AC\tly add the node count of RN\(ABC and then the node count of RN\(ACE\ount RN\(ACE\will add a virtual node ABCEF\because SPT\(RN\(ACE\no child with the node label F. When PT finishes all the operation, a SPT will be built. The SPT of table 1 is shown in Fig.2     Fig. 2 The shadow prefix tree of  sample database It is clear that the SPT has th e two important attributes after the building process. All the closed frequent itemsets could be found easily by scanning the SPT. By the way, SPT has the basal attributes of PT, so SPT can be stored in the disk after seri nvenient to read the SPT from the serialized SPT the next time to mining the same data set avoiding building process SPTCI is an closed frequent itemsets mining algorithm which ca n be updated incrementally .SPTCI realizes updating incrementally by uniting two SPT generated from two different data sets

 1 is bigger than the support count of Y in D 1 because X is a closed itemset in D 1 Let count_X1,count_X 2 represent the support count of X in D 1 and D 2 respectively and count_Y 1 count_Y 2 represent the support count of Y in  D 1 and D 2 respectively. In D 2 the support count of X is no little th an the support of Y. So count_X=count_X 1 count_X 2 count_Y=count_Y 1 count_Y 2 and count_X>count_Y, it is inconsistent with count_X=count_Y. So X is still a closed itemsets in the new transaction data base Theorem 2 indicates that if an itemsets is closed ite msets it will be still closed itemsets when add new transactions. In order to find all the closed itemsets from data set consisted of two sub dat a sets, it is necessary to conjunction each real nodes of two SPT generated from the two sub data sets. Algorithm 3 sho ws how to unite two SPT of different data sets. The unite_SPT operation is similarly to the union operation in al gorithm 1.The unite_SPT has two parameters: SPTA and SPTB. In this operation each real node in SPTA and SPTB will be united to the new SPT. At the last of unite_SPT operation , all the point of virtual node should be redirected to the corresponding node in the new SPT because the input SPT will be delete when the new SPT is generated   then suppose g\(X 1  let i be the first element in X sorted by alphabet order.

Algorithm 4 shows the process of SPTCI Theorem 3: In the SPT generated from data set D, there is a path corres ponding to each closed itemsets of D Proof: Suppose I is th e  set of items appears in the transaction of D, if X is a closed itemset, then C\(X it is obvious that X has a corresponding path in SPT, because T has a corresponding path in PT and the process of building SPT does not reducing the node of PT. If according to attribute 1,so  because theorem 1.It is conflicting with the definition of closed itemset. So SPT\(0 has a child with nod label i.

Fig.3 and 4 are the results of the experiment TABLE II T HE INFORMATION OF TEST DATASET Both dataset 1 and 2 are dens e datasets with long patterns The time consumed by SPTCI is little than the time consumed by FPL and AFOPT because there is no sub set testing process in SPTCI.SPTCI avoids the scanning of sub tree whose root node has a node count little than mini supp ort count, so the mini sup port count would not effect SPTCI as much as FPL and AFOPT 000\023 000\025\000\023 000\027\000\023 000\031\000\023 000\033\000\023 000\024\000\023\000\023 000\024\000\025\000\023 000\024\000\027\000\023 000\024\000\031\000\023 000\024\000\033\000\023 000\030 000\024\000\023\000\024\000\030\000\025\000\023\000\025\000\030\000\026\000\023 000P\000L\000Q\000L\000P\000X\000P\000\003\000V\000X\000S\000S\000R\000U\000W\000\013\000\010\000\014 000X\000V\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000W\000L\000P\000H\000\013\000V\000\014 0006\0003\0007\000&\000 000 000$\000\\0003\0007

the cost rate based strategyŽ and local-optimisation based strategyŽ can smartly choose to store or delete the datasets in one cloud storage service \(as shown in Table I\, thereby largely reducing the cost rate for storing datasets with one cloud service provider. If more cloud storage services are available as shown in Figure 4, the simulation of T-CSB algorithm with two additional storage servicesŽ demonstrates further reduction of the cost rate by taking bandwidth cost into account. Table I shows the number of datasets transferred and smartly stored in two representative cloud storage services with our T-CSB algorithm. Furthermore, how much cost can be reduced depends on the price of available storage services. In the simulation of T-CSB algorithm with additional Haylix storageŽ, although some datasets are transferred to Haylix for storage \(as shown in Table I\, the cost rate only drops slightly comparing to the local-optimisation based strategyŽ \(as shown in Figure 4\. This is because the price of Haylix is not much cheaper than Amazon S3 cloud. In contrast, in the simulation of T-CSB algorithm with additional Glacier storageŽ, our T-CSB algorithm significantly reduces the cost rate \(as shown in Figure 4\ by transferring datasets to Glacier 13 for storage \(as shown in Table I From the above simulation, we can see that for different price models of cloud storage services, our T-CSB algorithm can always store the datasets accordingly, even in the situation that the price difference is minor \(e.g. the simulation of TCSB algorithm with additional Haylix storageŽ\. Hence our TCSB algorithm is very effective in reducing the cost \(i.e. costeffective\ for storing generated application datasets with multiple service providers in the cloud VI R ELATED W ORK  Today, research on scientific applications in the cloud becomes popular [1    30 Co m p ar i ng t o  t h e  traditional computing systems, e.g. cluster, grid and HPC systems, a cloud computing system has cost benefits in various aspects [4   Wi th A m azon c l ou ds  c o s t m ode l an d  BO I N C  volunteer computing middleware, the work in [1 an aly s es  th e cost benefits of cloud computing versus grid computing. The work by Deelman et al. [11 a l s o  a p p lies Am azon  cl ou ds   c o s t  model and demonstrates that cloud computing offers a costeffective way to deploy scientific applications. The work mentioned above mainly focuses on the comparison of cloud computing systems and the traditional distributed computing paradigms, which shows that applications running in the cloud have cost benefits. However, our work focuses on reducing cost for running application in the cloud This paper is mainly inspired by the research in the area of scheduling, in which much work focuses on reducing various costsŽ for applications [2 sy st e m s [3 1 o r d a t a ce ntr e networks T h e d i ffer e n c e i s t h a t  sc h e d u l i ng a i m s  at  improving resource utilisation whilst our work investigates the trade-off among computation, storage and bandwidth costs which is a unique issue in cloud computing due to the pay-asyou-go model. Another important foundation for our work is the research on data provenance. Due to the importance of data    13 Data stored in Glacier usually need 3 to 5 hours to become available when users retrieve them. As analysed in Section II.B, users delay tolerance is out of the scope of this paper. Hence we only focus on the cost in the simulation provenance in scientific applications, many works about recording data provenance of the system have been done [9   Recently, research on data provenance in cloud computing systems has also appeared M o r e spe c ific a lly  Ost e r w e il e t  al e s e n t ho w t o ge ner a t e a da ta  de r i v a t i o n g r ap h  fo r execution of a scientific workflow. Foster et al. [1 pr o p o s e  the concept of virtual data in the Chimera system, which enables the automatic regeneration of datasets when needed Our DDG is based on data provenance, which depicts the dependency relationships of all the generated datasets in the cloud. With DDG, we can manage where the datasets are stored or how to regenerate them As the trade-off among computation, storage and bandwidth is an important issue in the cloud, much research has already embarked on this issue to a certain extent. First plenty of research has been done with regard to the trade-off between computation and storage. The Nectar system [15 is  designed for automatic management of data and computation in data centres, where obsolete datasets are deleted and regenerated whenever reused in order to improve resource utilisation. In [11  De elm an et al  p r es en t th at st o r in g so m e  popular intermediate data can save the cost in comparison to always regenerating them from the input data. In [2 A d am s e t  al. propose a model to represent the trade-off of computation cost and storage cost. In [33   th e au th o r s  pr o p o s e th e C T T SP algorithm that can find the best trade-off between computation and storage in the cloud, based on which a highly cost-effective and practical strategy is developed for storing datasets with one cloud service provider [3  How e v e r th e a b ov e w o rk  di d n o t  consider bandwidth cost into the trade-off model. In [6 B a li g a  et al. investigate the trade-off among computation, storage and bandwidth in the infrastructure level of cloud systems, where reducing energy consumption is the main research goal. In [3   Agarwala et al. transform application data to certain formats and store them with different cloud services in order to reduce storage cost in the cloud, but data dependency and the option of data regeneration are not considered in their work. In this paper we propose the T-CSB algorithm which can find the best tradeoff among computation, storage and bandwidth costs for storing datasets of linear DDG in the cloud. This algorithm can be utilised for cost-effectively storing generated application datasets with multiple service providers in the cloud VII C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  In this paper, we have investigated the unique features of storing large volume of generated scientific datasets with multiple cloud service providers in the cloud. Towards achieving the cost-effectiveness, we have proposed a T-CSB Trade-off among Computation, Storage and Bandwidth algorithm to find the minimum cost storage strategy for datasets of linear DDG, which also represents the best trade-off among three key factors \(computation, storage and bandwidth for the cost of data storage in the cloud.  This algorithm can be utilised for cost-effectively storing generated application datasets with multiple service providers in the cloud. General simulations indicate that our T-CSB algorithm is very effective in reducing cost for cloud storage In our current work, we assume that the storage of one cloud service provider have a unified price. However, in the
