of the information system. Firstly, defines a associationrule characteristic Information Granule, which can be treated as a sub-definition of the Information Granule and a association-rule characteristic Information Granularity matirx is defined as well. Secondly, we present a new approach of computing on support degree and confidence degree, which are commonly used in problems of association-rule and decision-rule in information systems. Finally we build a whole knowledge-obtaining algorithm for the association rules and decision-making, and test its availability by numerous experiments  1. Introduction  Granular Computing is a fast-developing subject 
and it is a fusion of the rouge set, fuzzy mathematic and Artificial Intelligence 1,2,3,4 Base on the philosophical thinking, it builds the granular structure of the realworld problem, and finds the solution of that problem by setting the computing model on the granular structure. It is a combination of Philosophical Thinking Methodology and Computing Model. Studying the granular computing methods and building the granular computing models, under the guide of the philosophical thinking, is the main research direction of Granular Computing in the future 
In this article, we present the definitions of the association-rule Information Granularity matrix, the association-rule Information Granul, the association-rule Information Granularity matrix, and the Algorithm that based on the theories above  2.

Assuming the amount of digit 1 in a binary information granule of attribute P is the granular degree of this information granule P then, the support number of an itemset of this attribute P is equal to the granular degree P For example, the granular degree a of binary information granule a 101000011001, is 5 Definition 4  I k K itemset  and its granulating. In the information system S the set which contains the associating K attributes is called K itemset. Its granulating is the conjunctive of those k binary granule of attributes, And the outcome is a binary Information Granule whose granular degree is much smaller For example L\006 information system S K C 1  C 2  C k are the binary information  granules of those K atributes Then C 1  003  C 2 003  003 C k are K itemset K its granular degree is C 1  003  C 2 003  003 C k   Definition 5 L\006 support degree L\006 The support degree of the k itemset, is the probability of the k itemset in U  equal to P  I k  I k  U  J The granular degree of the itemset is its support number Definition 6  K Item association-rule. The support degree of I k  which is bigger than an assigned value J  Definition  7 L\006 Confidence degree Assume C is the condition attribute of the association-rule D is the decision-making attribute of the association-rule, then confidence degree of C 001 D is P  D  C  L\011  D  003  C  C  000\003 Definition 8 decision-making rules. The associationrule which satisfies the minimum-support-degree and minimum-confidence-degree at the same time, the rule C 001 D is called decision-making rule  3  The Basic Theory of Association-rule Characteristic Information Granule  Definition 9 the granulating of associationcharacteristic of I k is the binary bunch whose length is  AT which is associated with the attributes subscript  The binary bunch value will be set to '1  whose position relative with the attribute appears in I k t otherwise it will be set to '0 All of the association-characteristic information granule in I k could be combined into a matrix RM k  K We will use association-characteristic information granule P ki to represent associated I Ki P ki is a line of RM k K For example, in the information system S  AT  a,b,c 2 item-set LG a,b LILG  b,c LI  a,c means P 21 L\011K K K 110 P 22  KôKõK 011 P 23  KôK 101 its 2 itemset's association-rules martix  000 000 000 000 000 000  101 011 110 2 RM  Theorem 1 the amount of atributes in the information system S is N K 000  AT  L\011  N K its 1 itemset associationrule matrix is N steps matrix.For example: in the information system S  AT  a,b,c 1 itemset association-rule matrix is 000 000 000 000 000 000  001 010 100 1 RM  Definition 10 the granulating of the K itemset's association rules.:same with definition 9 Theorem 2: the granule degree of P k iS P ki  GM  P ki 003 GM j   If P ki 003 GM j  L\011 P ki K then P ki 003 GM j  L\011 1, otherwise  P ki 003 GM j  L\011 0 Prove  000 if P ki 003 GM j  L\011  P ki   means the jth event satisfy the association rules P ki 000 the Information Granule which P ki stands for should be set to 1, otherwise should be 0 000 if P ki 003 GM j  000  P ki stand for the number jth event do not satisfy the itemset association P ki 000 so P ki so the Information Granule which P ki stands for should be set to 1  004 the granule degree of P k   P k  L\011 P ki  GM  000  003 U j j ki GM P 1  Theorem 3 Assume RM ki  RM kj as two item association-characteristic information granule,and  RM ki 005 RM kj  L\011 K 1 000 RM ki 005 RM kj are k 1 item association-characteristic information granule Definion 4 K items association-rules information granule P k is a combined with condition attribute set C  and decision-making attribute set D  D k C k k P P P   006  the support degree of decisionmaking rules C 001 D  L\011  P k  P k-D    4.

The general concept has been given below 1 Select N the number of trees to grow, and m a number no larger then the number of variables 2 for i=1 to N Call Train set 3 Draw a bootstrap sample from the data, term those not in the bootstrap sample as out-of-bag data 4 Grow a random tree, where at each node the best set is chosen among m randomly selected variables. The tree is grown to a maximum size and it should not be pruned 5 Use the tree to predict out-of-bag data 6 In the end use the predictions on out-of-bag data to form majority votes 7 Prediction of test data is done by majority votes from predictions from the ensemble of trees By applying the concept of decision tree classifier a three class classifier to classify the transactional database objects as normal, benign and malignant IV R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION A Classification Figure 7.

Performance of classification assignment has been measured in terms of classification accuracy. The outcome of classification can be described as  True positive TP\: A row t i predicted to be in class C j and is actually in it  False positive FP\: A row t i predicted to be in class C j but is actually not in it  True negative TN\: A row t i not predicted to be in class C j but is actually not in it  False negative FN\: A row t i not predicted to be in class C j but is actually in it  The precision and recall are used to determine the accuracy of the classifier Fig. 6 Binary output image Fig.7.

When the system contains s number of matrix, the confusion matrix is in the form of sxs matrix. If there exists any entry for example C j means it represents the number of rows assigned to a class C j instead of the classification C i The general form of the confusion matrix is given in the following table I. The proposed system consists of three classes for classification like Normal, Benign and Malignant. The confusion matrix that represents the association rule 3 under the decision tree classification is a 3x3 matrix. This association rule consists of 200 rules for instances means then 151 are normal, 27 are malignant and 22 are benign TABLE I GENERAL TWO CLASS CONFUSION MATRIX Human provision Category Yes No Yes TP FP Classifier provision No FN TN
