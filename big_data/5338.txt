Application of Fuzzy Associ ation Rules in Intrusion Detection  KaiXing Wu Department of Information&Elctronic Engineering Handan ,Hebei Province, China Juan Hao   student Department of Information&Elctronic Engineering Handan ,Hebei Province, China Chunhua Wang  student Department of Information&Elctronic Engineering Handan ,Hebei Province, China hahazj186@163.com   Abstract Intrusion detection system \(IDS\d on data mining technology in this paper Association rule mining which is 
a method of data mining will make the boundaries of intervals hard. It will increase the information loss. In this paper, a novel framework based on data mining techniques is proposed for designing IDS. In this framework the classification engine, which is actually the core of the IDS, uses fuzzy association rules for building classifiers. Particularly, the fuzzy association rulesets are exploited as descriptive models of different classes. Generally the proposed approach outperforms other methods, especially in terms of false positive rate  Keywords- intrusion detection system; data mining; association rules; fuzzy association rules I  I NTRODUCTION  With the computer systems based on network to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives, these systems 
become the attacked target. In or der to protect the security of the system, we need to build a level of network security systems. Intrusion detection is an important component of the network security. Intrusion detection techniques can be categorized into anomaly detection and misuse detection Signature-based misuse detecti on techniques are currently most widely used in practice. However, there is a growing interest in intrusion detection community toward the application of machine learning techniques in this field. Considering this new trend and the extensive amount of data involved in such learning application, data mining approaches seem to be appropriate for this purpose Various data mining techniques have been applied to intrusion detection because it ha s the advantage of discovering 
useful knowledge that describes userís or programís behavior from large audit data sets. Association rule induction is one of the most well-known approaches in data mining techniques According to the different quantitative attributes, association rule is divided into Boolean association rules and quantitative association rules. Boolean association rules could only handle simple item-based transactions. The quantitative association rule starts by partitioning the attributes domains and combining adjacent partitions. Then, by cons idering each pair of attribute and its corresponding partition as an item, the problem is transformed into the Boolean one. Although this method can solve the problems introduced by quantitative attributes, it causes the sharp boundary prob 
lem. So, fuzzy approach is proposed to handle both quantitative attributes and sharp boundary problems. In this paper, intrusion detection systems based on fuzzy association rules have been established is proposed II  D ATA MINING IN INTRUSION DETECTION  A  Association rule Association rule induction is one of the most well-known approaches in data mining techniques. It is to find the interesting connections between items of a given data set Database T is a collection of n transactions, {T 1 T 2 T n  and I is the set of all items, {i 
1 i 2 i m where each of the transactions T j 1 0010 j 0010 n\ the database T represents a set of items \(T j 014 I\tem set is defined as a non-empty subset of I An association rule can be represented as 000;\001\027 Y\(c, s\where X 014 I, Y 0140 I and X 001 Y 000 In this association rule, s is called support and c is confidence of th e association rule. The support is the percentage of the transactions in which both X and Y appear in the same transaction a 
nd the confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions that contain both X and Y to the number of transactions that contain only X. It can be described as follows Support \(X 001 Y\ P \(X 001 Y Confidence \(X 001 Y\\(Y|X Association rule is that support and confidence to meet the thresholds given by the user. The basic Association rule works in two steps. First, it finds frequent itemsets. In the second step the minimum confidence rules are generated from the frequent itemsets found in the first step B  Classification Classification is one of the topics of data mining. Its goal is 
to build the classification attribute model based on attribute Data classification has two steps The first, a data set is select The class label of each set \(train ing samples\ for training data set is known. The class label of each training samples is provided, so the first step al so is the supervised learning process. Usually, the learning model is described by the classification rules, decision tree or mathematical formula. The second step, the model is classified. First the prediction accuracy of the model \(classificat ion rules each test sample, the known cla ss label and the prediction label of the sample are compared. If the model's accuracy rate can be accepted, it will be used to classi fy the data set that the class label is unknown

C  Clustering Clustering is to identify the internal rules of the data object The objects are grouped to form a class of similar objects, and export the data distribution. Similar or dissimilar measure is based on the values of the property described by the data object Usually, it is described by the distance. When the mining task is confronted with the lack of domain knowledge or incomplete data set, clustering is used to divide the unidentified the data object into different classes automatically, and it can not be restricted and interfered by a priori knowledge, to obtain the information of the original data set. Difference between classification and clustering is that classification is applied to the data object, and clustering is to find the classification rules implied in the mixed data objects III  FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES  A  Limitations of association rules According to the different quantitative attributes association rule is divided into Boolean association rules and quantitative association rules. In reality, the data are quantitative in most cases, so t quantitative association rules mining research is very important. The general method to solve quantitative association rules is that the value of the property is divided into several regions by a certain criteria and then is converted to a sequence-<attribute interval>. Thus quantitative association rule will be transformed  into Boolean association rules. However, there are some problems On the one hand, if the interval division is too large confidence of the rules included in the interval will be very low So that it will cause a small number of rules, and will be a corresponding reduction in the amount of information. If the interval division is too small, support of the rules included in the interval will be very low. So that it will cause a small number of rules. On other hand, if the domain of property is divided into the non-overlapping interval, the discrete data in the database is mapped to the interval. As potential elements near the interval are excluded by clear division, it will lead to some significant interval is ignored. If the domain of property is divided into overlapping intervals, the elements in the border may be in two intervals at the same time. These elements will contribute to the two intervals, resulting in some intervals are overemphasized In order to solve the problem of sharp boundary, fuzzy theory is proposed. The membership function is used to define data set in fuzzy sets of the attribute domain, in order to achieve the purpose of softening the border B  fuzzy association rules Given a database T with attributes I and the definitions of fuzzy sets associated with attributes in I, the objective is to find out some interesting regularities between attribute values in a guided way. Any fuzzy association rule is in the following form If X is A then Y is B.                                                                 \(1 In the above rule, X = {x 1 x 2 x p and Y = {y 1 y 2  y q are attribute sets. X and Y are disjoint subsets of I. A 12     p xx x f ff and B 12     p yy y f ff  contain the fuzzy sets associated with the co rresponding attributes in X and Y. For example kk x x f F 000  is a fuzzy set, defined on x k domain Each pair of   k kx x f  or   k ky y f is called an item, and each pair of \(X, A\or \(Y, B\mset The first part of the rule ëX is Aí is called the antecedent and ëY is Bí is called the consequent of the rule. The semantics of the rule is when ëX is Aí is satisfied, we can imply that 000 Y is B 000 is also satisfied. Here the word ìsatisfiedî means there are sufficient amount of records which contribute their votes to the attribute/fuzzy set pairs and the sum of these votes is greater than a user specified threshold An appropriate rule should have enough significance and a high certainty factor. Significan ce and certainty factor are two concepts, equivalent to support and confidence that were introduced by Agrawal in the domain of Boolean association rules Fuzzy association rule induction algorithm has two steps As in Apriori algorithm, the first step is to find the so-called large itemsets which are itemset s with significance higher than a user specified threshold. The significance factor of an itemset is calculated by first summing all votes of each record with respect to that itemset, then dividing it by the total number of records Let X = {x 1 x 2 x p be a set of attributes and A = {a 1  a 2 a p be a set of fuzzy sets, such that a j 001\031 j x F and also let  1 a m  2 a m  p a m be the set of membership functions of A such that j a m  represents the membership function of a j The following formula is used to cal culate the significance factor of 002 X, A 002 i.e. S 002 X, A 002   inT records of number A X satisfying vote of sum ce significan    000  2          T i x i t a X Xi T i t A X S i 000 000 000 000 000 000D  where ||T|| represents the num ber of records in T and      0 jj j aAi j a ai j m t x ifm tx otherwise 000Z 000D 000 000t 000 3 in which 000 is a threshold used to avoid taking low membership values into account. As it can be observed in \(2 operator  mul 000  is used to compute each record 000 s vote The second step in fuzzy association rule induction is generating rules using the large itemsets induced in the first step, considering certainty factor Let \(Z, C\a large itemset. Any fuzzy association rule induced from this large itemset will be in the form ëif X is then Y is Bí, where X 0140 Z, Y 000=\002 X, A 0140 C and B 000&\002 A Certainty factor for this rule is calculated as follows 000\013\000\014\000\013\000\014 000^\000 000\013\000\014 000 000 000\013\000\014 000^\000    ikk ijj tT z Z c i k XA YB tT x X a i j tz C tx 000D 000D 000è\000 000è\000 000 000 000 000 000 4 Where

This framework is composed of two phases: training and detection phases. Figure 1  depicts a schematic view of different modules involved. The basic idea of this framework is: First, the training data is preprocessed The rule sets are established by the fuzzy association rule mining in the standard mode. Second, the testing data is preprocessed. The sample sets are established by the fuzzy association rule mining in the current mode. Finally classifier the sample set which match the rule set will be labeled by the classifier  Fuzzy association rules are used to build classifiers. We introduce some measures to assess how well any new sample is matched to a ruleset. Using th ese measures, we declare, the class corresponding to the best matched ruleset, as the label of the sample Let T be the set of all training samples in which each sample corresponds to one of L possible classes. We partition T to L disjoint subsets \(T 1 T 2 T L h that T l 1 000 l 000 L\ontains all samples of class l. These subsets are independently used to induce L rulesets\(R 1 R 2 R L for each l \(1 000 l 000 L R l  12   l ll lp rr r contains rules describing the patterns observed in class l The next step, i.e. the classification phase, is to assign a label to a new sample, say t for l=l to L 000^\000  l tR MM MatchingMeasure \(t 002 R l  002  Sample_label=FindBestMatch 000^\000 1  tR MM  000^\000 2  tR MM  000^\000  L tR MM  002  000^\000  l tR MM provides us with a measure to estimate how well a sample, t, can be matched to ruleset R l and the function FindBestMatch, which is usually a simple minimum or maximum function, finds the class label whose ruleset is believed to be the best match for the sample t V  D ETECTION FRAMEWORK  In this paper, fuzzy rule induction and classifier modules are implemented using standard C In the case of rule induction Borgeltís implementation of Boolean association rule induction is used as a start point A  Date sources As mentioned before, KDD-99 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed framework for intrusion detection. This dataset is a common benchmark for evaluation of intrusion detection techniques.KDD-99 consists of several components, that two of them are used in this work. In all experiments described below 10%KDDí dataset is used for the purpose of training and the so-called ëCorrectedí dataset is used as a test set. Several new and novel never-before-seen attacks have been used in Correctedí in order to assess the generalization ability of ID systems B  Evaluation Performance of Intrusion Detection Systems is usually evaluated in terms of false positive and detection rates which are estimated as follows  Number of false positive False positive rate Total number of normal connections  1Number of false negatives Detection rate Total number of attack connections  where false positive \(negative\is the number of normal\(attack\beled as attack \(normal For better assessment of the implemented scenarios detection rate is reported in three cases; by using all Correctedí set records, by excluding unknown \(unseen attacks, and finally by excluding known attacks As observed in Table 001\011 the experiment is based on misuse detection techniques, so except th e last case \(with exclusion of old attacks tisfying. Some classification results on the same train and test data set using other techniques are shown in Table 001\012 By comparing the results of the proposed approach with these results, it can be concluded that the obtained detection rate is nearly optimum while false detection rate is kept much lower in most cases TABLE I  E VALUATION RESULTS  All records Known attacks Unknown attacks Detection rate 92.5 96 13 False positive rate  3.22 3.22 3.22 TABLE II  S OME REPORTED RESULTS ON KDD DATASET   Data mining Clustering K-NN SVM HSOM Detection rate  70-90 93 91 98 9091.5 False positive rate 2 10 8 10 7.614.5 VI  SUMMARY Data mining technology is the emerging field of study. It is a complex process of dealing with large amounts of data. And it provides a new intrusion detection method. The combination of fuzzy set theory and association rules mining of data mining provide a more effective method for the establishment of intrusion detection rule sets and comparison between rules sets In this paper methods of data mining in intrusion detection and fuzzy association rules are intr oduced. Based on these theories the fuzzy association rules are applied to intrusion detection systems and intrusion detection framework is built. Finally, the experiments show that the rate of false positives is superior to other methods

These frequent treatments are similar to LCS patients with only one treatment different which is the fourth most frequent treatment, INDIVID PROCEDURE REQ CUMPUTER EQUIP.  From the most frequent treatment to the third most frequent treatment, they are the same: physical therapy, nerve conduction and Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery.  The fifth most frequent treatment is anesthesia which comes along with surgery b  Association Rules for HCS Patients The support threshold is 0.5 and we have the following association rules in Table 9.  Since every patient in this group had at least one Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery, the first rule says çeveryone here has surgeryé, which is true.  88% of these patients have physical therapy and 83% have anesthesia.  In rules #4 and 5, patients who have physical therapy may also have Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery and vice versa.  Patients have physical therapy before or after surgery.  It is also clear that patients who have anesthesia are those patients who have Carpal Tunnel Release Surgeries but not every surgery patient will have anesthesia, as shown in rules #6 and #7 These rules can explain the relation between physical therapy and anesthesia \(rules #8 and #9\ treatments are related to surgery, as shown in rule #10.  Patients may also have diagnostic exams, such as nerve conduction and physical therapy assessment before surgery, as shown in rules #11 and #13. Physicians may evaluate patients condition before or after their sessions of physical therapy to see if these treatments are right for them, as shown in rule 12.  If the patientês condition is still serious and does not respond to treatments according to physiciansê evaluation Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery is the last resort to heal Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

4  Comparison of Treatments among NS Patients, LCS Patients, and HCS Patients It is clear that patients with a more severe condition tend to receive more treatments than those with a less severe condition.  Non-surgery patients tend to have physical therapy to relieve their pain and diagnostic exams to evaluate their condition.  Since their condition is not serious, there is no need for Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery.  On the other hand, some patients after sessions of physical therapy or other non-surgical treatments, which did not relieve their pain,  have surgery to fix the problem.  In practice, a package for just injured patients may contain diagnostic exams to evaluate their conditions, such as physical therapy assessment, nerve conduction, and needle electromyography, and sessions of physical therapy.  If the condition is serious or sessions of physical therapy do not help, the patients may be automatically authorized for a surgery package which may include Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery, anesthesia, and after-surgery physical therapy sessions  C  Association Rules Related with Time 1  Basic Idea If we want to find association rules related with time, one possible way is to add time stamps to data items.  In our experiment, each treatment entry is timestamped.  Since each treatment has a date of service and a date of injury, we can obtain the month performed after injury and attach it to the treatment.  Then these timeannotated entries are processed and analyzed by the Apriori algorithm to discover time-bas ed association rules.  Since these rules are related to time, we will present them in patterns instead of antecedent and consequent pairs 2  Temporal Patterns for NS Patients The patterns are shown in Table 10.  NS patients usually have their physical therapy assessment when they have their first physical therapy, as seen in patterns #1, #2 and #7.  They may also have other diagnostic exams, such as needle electromyography and nerve conduction, but still these exams are performed when they have their first physical therapy, in rules #5 and #6.  Rule #8 says that needle electromyography and nerve conduction are usually performed together in the first 8 months.  Patients tend to have their physical therapy assessment and physical therapy on their first, third, seventh, or eighth month, as shown in rule #9, which means patients tend to start their physical therapy sessions in these months              TABLE X  T EMPORAL P ATTERNS FOR NS  P ATIENTS  Patterns Frequency 1 Physical therapy\(0,1,2\, Physical therapy assessment\(0 1.6 2 Physical therapy\(0,1,6\, Physical therapy assessment\(0 1.2 3 Physical therapy\(0,1,2 2.3 4 Physical therapy\(0,1,6 1.2 5 Physical therapy\(0\, Needle electromyography\(0\,Nerve conduction\(0 1.2 6 Physical therapy\(1\, Needle electromyography\(1\,Nerve conduction\(1 1.2 7 Physical therapy\(1,2\, Physical therapy assessment\(1 1.6 8 Needle electromyography and Nerve conduction}\(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 1.2 9 Physical therapy and Physical therapy assessment}\(0,2,6,7 1.2  3  Temporal Patterns for LCS Patients Table 11 exhibits the temporal patterns for LCS patients.  Some patterns are similar to those found for NS patients.  For example, according to patterns #6 and #7, physical therapy assessment is performed in the month of the first physical therapy, and needle electromyography and nerve conduction are both performed in the same month.  The main difference is that NS patients do not have a Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery.  In patterns #1 and #2, surgery and anesthesia are performed in the fifth  or sixth month, followed by physical therapy sessions.  The last pattern shows that patients usually have their surgery in months fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth 4  Temporal Patterns for HCS Patients Table 12 reveals the temporal patterns for HCS patients.  These patterns can be divided in 2 parts: one is related to Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery and the other is related to physical therapy and physical therapy assessment.  As for surgery anesthesia usually comes with it and patients usually have their surgery between the third month and one year.  In the month following a surgery, patients have physical therapy assessment and start to have physical therapy in the following 4 months.  Just like for the two other patient groups, physical therapy assessment is performed in the month of the first physical therapy and is usually performed within one year

NS patients tend to have diagnostic exams or tests in the very beginning.  Surgery patients tend to have physical therapy for longer periods of time in order to relieve pain.  When physical therapy does not help, patients turn to Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery to fix the problem since it is the last resort.  After surgery, they have sessions of physical therapy.  It is also clear that patients in the HCS group tend to have after-surgery physical therapy longer than LCS patients do.  In practice, just injured patients could be automatically authorized a low-cost treatment package which may contain diagnostic exams to evaluate their conditions, such as physical therapy assessment, nerve conduction, and needle electromyography, and sessions of physical therapy up to six months.  If the evaluation of the exam reveals the seriousness of the condition and at least three month sessions of physical therapy do not help, the patients could be automatically authorized for a surgery package which includes Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery anesthesia, one physical therapy assessment, and up to fivemonth sessions of after-surgery physical therapy  D  Comparison between Association Rules and Association Rules Related to Time Association rules show the correlation among treatments for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome patients, such as physical therapy and physical therapy assessment, or physical therapy and surgery.  However, if we add time stamps to the treatment entries, and then apply the Apriori algorithm, we may find association rules related to time Since the pattern is time-annotated, it is possible for us to discover both the duration of a certain treatment and the sequence of treatments for patients and, thus, understand the evolution of this syndrome and estimate the time and possible expenses involved.  For example, when running association rules, we found that physical therapy and physical therapy assessment occur together.  After adding time notation to each treatment, we found physical therapy assessment is performed at the same time as the first session of physical therapy and there is only one time of physical therapy assessment and multiple sessions of physical therapy V  S IGNIFICANCE TO THE I NSURANCE I NDUSTRY  These extracted association rules related to time help us understand the evolution of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Therefore they are helpful in treatment authorization prediction, and fraud detection.  Association rules without time-annotation tell us which treatments happen together When a patient has just gotten injured, he/she could be automatically authorized a package containing diagnostic exams, such as a hand/wrist x-ray and physical therapy assessment, and a couple sessions of physical therapy according to Table 4 and Table 5.  If the results from the diagnostic exams reveal the patientês condition to be serious or the patientês condition does not respond to sessions of physical therapy, the patient could be automatically authorized a Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery package, which includes anesthesia, surgery, and sessions of physical therapy, based on Table 7 and Table 9 With time-stamps, the analysis can include the timing and consequently be more precise.  Diagnostic exams can be authorized in the first few months, and patients may have Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery from the third month to a year or so, followed by up to three months of physical therapy, according to Table 12.  The insurance authorization system can authorize Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery to patients only when the surgery request is made after or in 
761 


the third month, and the surgery package can indicate anesthesia and surgery at the same time, and also a 3-month session of physical therapy after the surgery.  This way insurance companies can accurately estimate treatment costs, and employers can accurately estimate the related human resource cost.  Needless to say, insurance companies can also detect irregularities and save money.  As a result the insurance cost and, consequently, the premium may decrease VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Data sets in workersê compensation databases are composed of medical claim data, which can be used to provide correlation between diseases and treatments and correlation between treatments.

incremental option for a data mining algorithm is of course preferable in an inductive database system, since it allows the exploitation of all the available information in the system in order to speed up the response time The better performance of incremental algorithm depicted in the result section  worked on problems with item and context dependent constraint present a solution for item extraction from frequently updated database.

frequent, and there is no equal-support pruning in its subsets. So the Bitwise And Operation on binary strings of 0001100011 and 0001100011 is employed. As the result is 0001100011, the support of the itemset {G C, E} is 4, which is equal to {G, C}. E is put into the equal-support set of {G, C}, and does not need to add a new son node. When itemset {C, A, E} is checked, all of its subsets are frequent, and none of them is in the equal-support set. The corresponding two bit strings 0001101111 and 0011101011, are operated by &. The resultant string is 0001101011. The number of 1 in string 0001101011 is 5. So the support of itemset {C, A E} is 5, which is not equal to the support of {C, A}. So a new son node is added to {C, A}. The Trie after generation\(3  5 8 8 G C A E A 4 C 4 E 6 A 6 E 6 E 7 5 E 0001101011 E  Fig. 2.

In the last step, all frequent itemsets are written out according to the Trie  5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  


The proposed algorithm is tested on all the five datasets prepared by Roberto Bayardo, from UCI and PUMSB datasets. The datasets are available at http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi. The characteristics of the datasets are shown in Table 6. The first column contains the names of the datasets. The second column shows the number of items contained in each dataset. The third column shows the average length of each transaction and the last column indicates the total number of transactions in each dataset TABLE 6 DATABASE CHARACTERISTICS Datasets Items Avg. length Records mushroom 119 23 8,124 chess 75 37 3,196 pusmsb* 2,088 50.4 49,046 connect 129 43 65,557 pusmsb 2,113 74.0 49,046 In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, BitApriori is compared to the fast Apriori implemented in Ferenc [20], and another similar recently published, algorithm Index-BitTableFI proposed by Song [16]. In order to show the efficiency of the pruning technology employed in BitApriori another algorithm BitAprioriNE, which is the same as BitApriori, except that it does not use the special equal-support pruning, is designed. All of the above four algorithms are implemented in C++ and compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experiments are performed on a Windows XP PC equipped with a Pentium 2.0 GHz CPU and 1.5 GB of RAM memory  For each dataset, a mass of different support thresholds are tested, and the five most important of them are chosen for reporting in this paper. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3-7. In the figures, the y-coordinate denotes the execution time \(in seconds while x-coordinate denotes the support threshold 0 100 200 300 400

In this dataset, the special equal-support pruning works efficiently. In Fig. 4, BitAprioriNE beats Apriori and Index-BitTableFI. In Fig. 5, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified, especially when the minimum support is low. In Fig. 6, BitAprioriWE exhausts the memory when the support threshold is lower than 0.8, but BitApriori does not. That means the special equal-support pruning contributes to save the memory. In Fig. 7, when the threshold is larger than 0.725, Apriori beats the BitApriori. But BitApriori outperforms the Apriori, when the threshold is lower than 0.725  


Apriori does not use the binary string and the special equal-support pruning. The BitTable is employed in Index-BitTableFI, but there is no special equal-support pruning, except for the frequent 2-itemsets BitAprioriNE outperforms Apriori in Fig. 3-5, but not in Fig. 6-7, because of the limitation of memory BitAprioriNE does better than Index-BitTableFI in Fig 4 and Fig. 5. In the mushroom, there is a vast number of equal-support itemsets for frequent 2-itemset. So Index-BitTableFI outperforms BitAprioriNE  On one hand, the special equal-support pruning is a useful technique for improving efficiency. The performance is improved significantly, especially when the databases contain many equal-support itemsets, such as the mushroom. It also reduces memory requirement On the other hand, the technique of binary string in BitApriori improves the efficiency of Apriori. These two techniques combine perfectly in BitApriori. So BitApriori has very good performance. It is the best for all of the five datasets  6. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, two effective techniques are employed to improve the performance of Apriori, by reducing the cost of candidate generation, and by support counting The two effective techniques are integrated perfectly in BitApriori, and improve the computational efficiency significantly. Experimental results have shown that BitApriori outperforms the fast Apriori and Index-BitTableFI, especially when the minimum support threshold is low  When the database is large, the BitApriori may suffer the problem of memory scarcity. So how to solve the memory problem will be the question addressed in one of our future works. And another work is to improve Bitwise And Operation on the binary string, or replace it by some more effective techniques  REFERENCES
