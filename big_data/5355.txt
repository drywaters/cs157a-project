 I NTRODUCTION  In cloud datacenters, resource requirements changes frequently. Therefore, dynamic allocating and managing resources to meet the SLA of each application is an important research issue. The objective of dynamic resource allocation is to satisfy the SLA while minimizing the power consumption in cloud datacenters. In order to satisfy the SLA of each application, resource prediction is a 
fundamental technology. A resource prediction tool is used to predict resource requirements, and then we can allocate resources in advance to avoid SLA violation. In existing resource allocation schemes, most of them adopt a neural network based prediction, which has been proved its prediction accuracy, so we also adopt a neural network based predictor There are two types of resource allocation 
server-aware resource allocation application-aware resource allocation 
and The server-aware resource allocation, which detects loading of a server and allocates VMs for all applications in the server, cannot assign different SLAs to different applications. In con trast, application-aware resource allocation, which detects loading in an application 
and allocates VMs to the application, can assign different SLAs to different applications In a cloud datacenter, even if we predict and allocate network bandwidth for each application in advance, the network may still congest. In order to resolve this problem we adopt an SDN-based OpenFlow e t w ork  w i t h a CICQ switch to schedule packets for different applications in the network layer. OpenFlow is an open standard to allow researchers to run experimental protocols in realistic networks and is currently deployed in large-scale datacenters, like GE  In this paper, we propose an Application-aware Resource Allocation \(App-RA\heme to predict resource requirements and allocate an appropriate number of VMs for each application in SDN-based cloud datacenters.

rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we review existing resource allocation mechanisms, compare application-aware and server-aware resource allocation schemes for cloud datacenters, and introduce the OpenFlow In section III, we describe the proposed App-RA scheme. In section IV, we evaluate our proposed App-RA scheme using CloudSim, and we compare the power consumption of the proposed App-RA with EAACVA, which is the best available related work for non-graphic applications. Finally we conclude this paper and outline future work II R ELATED W ORK  In order to satisfy the SLA for each application 
researchers have proposed resource allocation schemes used in cloud datacenters. As shown in Figure 1, there are two types of resource allocation: server-aware resource allocation and application-aware resource allocation. In the past, the server-aware resource allocation scheme was used in cloud datacenters. However, it cannot assign a different SLA to each application. Because there are always different applications in cloud datacenters, only setting a single SLA cannot satisfy different requirements of different applications. Thus, it is difficult to satisfy the SLA of each application in cloud datacenters. Nowadays, applicationaware resource allocation has become the major scheme in cloud datacenters

In n trodu ces a resource prediction scheme using a neural network and uses a resource allocation scheme to save power in cloud datacenters. However, it did not consider an SLA for each application in cloud datacenters We first review existing application-aware resource allocation which detects an applications loading and allocates VMs to the application. Application-aware resource allocation can satisfy different SLAs for different applications. Its prediction is still accurate if an application migrates to another server, and one still can allocate appropriate VMs to the application. To fully utilize the advantage we mentioned above, we adopt application-aware resource allocation for the proposed App-RA. In [4  i t  proposes an application-aware resource allocation scheme to dynamically manage resources, and it can satisfy the SLA and can allocate resources efficiently for web applications only. In other words, it determines how many VMs should be allocated to satisfy the SLA. However, it only adapts to web applications. In [5 it pr o p o s e s an  a p pli cati on a w are  resource allocation scheme with minimum power consumption. It runs benchmarks to measure how many VMs and power required in each application. The resource allocation scheme is based on a benchmark process which takes a lot of time. It cannot dynamically adjust numbers of VMs for different applications. In other words, it is a static scheme rather than a dynamic scheme. In addition, it did not consider graphic applications As shown in Table I, the proposed App-RA can adapt to all types of applications, meet different SLAs for different Table I: Comparison of the proposed App-RA with related work Approach EAACVA [5  App-RA proposed Suitabilit y for what types of applications For non-graphic applications All types Different SLAs for different applications Yes Yes SLA violation handler No Yes response time Bandwidt h  provisioning No Yes Resource prediction No Yes neural network based applications, adjust resources if an application violates its SLA, adjust bandwidth provisioning in an SDN-based datacenter network for all applications, and provide resource prediction for each application In recent years, researchers have proposed several SDNbased datacenter networks which combine with cloud datacenters.

Based on this observation, the proposed SDNbased cloud datacenter network schedules packets at application level and network delay can be decreased by better scheduling for an application requiring low network response time to meets its SLA III A PPLICATION AWARE R ESOURCE A LLOCATION FOR SDNBASED C LOUD D ATACENTERS  In the proposed App-RA, we propose an applicationaware resource prediction to predict resource requirements for each application. In Figure 2, we adopt a neural network to predict the resource requirements \(CPU, memory, GPU hard disk I/O and bandwidth utilization\or each application and we also use these five types of resource requirements as input factors for the neural network. When the neural network training completes, resource requirements can be predicted. In addition, because the number of users changes all the time in the internet, we also use as an input factor for the neural network to make prediction more accurate. In the following, we introduce the proposed Application-aware Resource Allocation \(App-RA\ scheme based on application-aware resource prediction to assign an appropriate number of VMs so as to meet the SLA of each applications    Figure 2: The proposed App-RA resource prediction scheme using a neural network

 In this section, we introduce the proposed applicationaware resource allocation scheme to allocate an appropriate number of VMs for each application. The objective of the proposed App-RA is to meet SLAs, allocate resources efficiently, reduce power consumption for each application and adapt all types of applications in cloud datacenters In a cloud datacenters, we may need to adjust the number of VMs required to meet each application. Algorithm 1 shows how to decide when to power-on or power-off VMs for an application. If the predicted utilization is greater than the VM Allocation Threshold of an application, we power on a VM to support this application. If the current utilization is less than the sum of all VMs capacity and the reserved resources \(maximum utilization … VM Allocation Threshold in an application, we power off a VM to save power for this application in the cloud datacenter  Power-on and power-off VMs for an application the number of VMs currently used by application  Maximum utilization 100 Unused resources = Maximum utilization - Predicted utilization Predicted utilization > VM Allocation Threshold   1 VM Allocation Threshold = VM Allocation Threshold + VM capacity Unused resources > \(VM capacity + \(Maximum utilization … VM Allocation Threshold   1 VM Allocation Threshold = VM Allocation Threshold … VM capacity  We also need to adjust the VM Allocation Threshold to meet the SLA of each application. Algorithm 2 shows how to dynamically adjust the VM Allocation Threshold. When the SLA \(for example, response time\ is violated, the VM Allocation Threshold is decreased according to an SLA weight which is a value between 0 and 1. If  approaches 0, it means more resources are reserved for an application which can result in decreasing the SLA violation of the application, and vice versa When the response time is lower than half of the response time specified in the SLA, the VM Allocation Threshold will be increased according to a power consumption weight which a value between 1 and 2. If approaches 2, it represents that very few resources are reserved for an application which can reduce power consumption, and vice versa       Adjustment of VM Allocation Threshold for an application the number of VMs currently used by application  1 Power consumption weight \(1 2 1  Current response time > Response time specified in SLA  VM Allocation Threshold = VM Allocation Threshold  Current response time < \(Response time specified in SLA / 2  VM Allocation Threshold = VM Allocation Threshold   In cloud datacenters, even if we predict and then allocate network bandwidth for each application in advance, the network may still congest. In order to resolve this problem we adopt an SDN-based OpenFlow [1 ne tw o r k w ith CI CQ  switches to schedule packets from different applications in the network layer. For example, the video streaming application needs more bandwidth, but the search engine application should have a high scheduling priority, so the packets of the search engine application can be sent earlier to avoid increasing network delay. We propose the following scheduling strategy in order to resolve the above problem 1 The controller maintains a bandwidth provisioning table for different types of applications and sends it to CICQ switches 2 The switches decide packet scheduling priorities based on the bandwidth provisioning table from the controller As shown in Table II, an example bandwidth provisioning table is provided; however, the actual bandwidth provisioning may be based on the charge of each application. First, we need to modify an OpenFlow controller to support our method. We add an APP-ID \(24 bits\abel of each application to the OpenFlow packet header [6 an d th u s  the controller can identify each application. The controller decides bandwidth provisioning for each application and modify the flow tables in switches. Second, we modify the OpenFlow switches to support our method. In Figure 3, we use a CICQ \(Combined-Input-Crosspoint-Queued\ switc to handle packet scheduling for each application. The CICQ switch is a kind of crossbar sw itches with a small exclusive buffer at each crosspoint  Table II: Bandwidth provisioning for different types of applications

as we will see in section V we can attract 1033 nodes in a 7500 nodes graph Finally the proposed algorithm is a combination of mincut and ranking algorithms with greedy technique over nodes which can potentially be in”uential with this we can reduce time over greedy methods and get more quality extra seeds IV E XPERIMENT D ESIGN The proposed algorithm was applied over twitter data sets which are constructed from certain subjects and also it was applied over random build graphs We run all the algorithms with the same seed nodes discovered in the entropy ranking phase   and    In addition to the same source s node sink t node and those which were chosen from speci“c studied graphs A Algorithms for Comparison The proposed algorithm will be compared with two speci“c algorithms the DG algorithm and the GP algorithm DG was chosen to be compared with the algorithm in order to get an extra seed set     As the experiments will show the proposed algorithm is able to obtain more quality results better extra seed nodes when compared with the DG algorithm Although with the GP algorithm it is possible to obtain higher quality results the proposed algorithm is able to obtain faster results than GP when the size of the data sets increases We also use random seed that were chosen heuristically together with a single discount algorithm The single discount algorithm heuristic consist in a simple degree discount heuristic where each neighbor of a newly selected seed discounts its degree by one This is used in cascade models B Twitter Graphs We use twitter data sets from Truthy project Those graphs from politics social movements and news are used to try to understand how communication spreads on twitter This project recollects tweets for the last nine months and packed them in data sets available to the public Using graphs software visualization such Gephi it is possible to recognize some of the nodes preferences at the graphs Then it is possible to use them as a seed nodes positive and negative We also recollected data from twitter for marketing datasets where the users are related with a certain subject The subject could be hashtag or keyword and the user relations are found by mentions or retweets C Random Graphs Although some random graphs generators could not represents any real problem we are going to use a randomly generated datasets to compare the testing algorithms against the proposed algorithm in order to see how they behave as the graph increses in size degree at the nodes etc  For this random graphs are generated with well know algorithm BarabasiAlbert generator  The importance of using random graphs is because these can be con“gured to modify the average degree of the nodes sparsity and of course we can handle the amount of nodes to be used Modifying these parameters we can create graphs to represent real possible behaviors V E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS The algorithms were implemented on Intel Core I7 3.4 GHz with 8Gb RAM and this scenario was the same for all algorithm comparisons A Attracted Nodes As we mention earlier most of the traditional IM algorithms are focused in maximizing the amount of nodes which can change their opinion Under this assumptions it is clear GP is going to have the best results But as we saw in the last section it is possible to obtain most of the in”uential nodes by reducing the number of operations with EMinG In the  israel dataset Fig 4 GP and EMinG got the same results because high quality nodes are also included in top m  m  ranked nodes In this case m    V   7 was chosen for testing on all experiments In  immigration we got almost the same results with both algorithms The variation was of at most 15 extra seeds For example node N4620 is not of high entropy but it is in”uential Single discount had acceptable results For the rst and second experiments we got 1910 and 2005 nodes respectively In the random graph while looking for 30 extra seed nodes with GP we were able to attract 1171 nodes with EMinG we got 1066 Using the single discount algorithm we got 794 with DG we got 549 and with Random we got 240 In the fourth experiment DG and Random got the worst results Furthermore in the randomly generated graph it was more notorious the not so good results for DG and random seed placement For random seeed placemente seeds were selected at random and the second phase of EMinG was used to nd attrected nodes and extra seeds The main difference between the rst and third experiments is the out-degree node average In  israel is 1.21 in  immigration is 1.14 in random graph experiment is 2.48 and  syria 1.18 Although the rst second and third expriments Fig 4 were designed to show the performance of the algorithms the fourth experiment was done over a Big Data set 1,000,000 nodes in order to show the scalability of the algorithms Thus we noticed that with GP an EMinG we got 671310 and 650010 extra attracted nodes respectively It is more with m 30 DG and Random got small increases Finally the single discount algorithm had incremental results but they were much worse when compared with ones by GP and EMinG B Running Time The nal benchmark was done over the running time Fig 5 It was possible to see that DG and random seed placement were the fastest algorithms at the four datasets with respect to EMinG but it was only with an advantage of seconds For large amount of data EMinG was faster than GP The interesting fact was that the Single discount algorithm had almost the same results in time when compared with EMinG For example at the  israel graph in order to nd 5 extra seeds there were 300 seconds of difference between both algorithms DG and EMinG Still the nodes quality for DG were not as good as in EMinG We had a similar result for for

Figure 4 Number of attracted nodes over  israel 4,000 nodes  immigration 6,307 nodes Barabasi-Albert 7,500 nodes and  syria 1,000,000 graphs increased the number of seeds to 30 and used DG we got 1878 attracted nodes Instead with EMinG while looking for 25 extra seeds the algorithm got 1989 attracted nodes Finally with random seed only placemente there were only 1221 attracted nodes Now the GPs results were slower than EMinG This is because with GP we need to evaluate every single nodes in”uence Then while looking for a small number of extra seeds it can be seen that it has lower running time But with 10 or more extra seeds to nd GPs time complexity increases faster than any other algorithm For example to nd 30 seeds in the Barabasi-Albert random graph GP runned for 11171.76 seconds against EMinG that runned only for 4814.04 seconds in addition that GP got only 9 more attracted nodes For the same experiment the single discount algorithm runned for 4579.09 seconds which is less than EMinG but with 111 attracted nodes less For  syria graph EMinG attracted each node in 0.83 seconds versus GP that attrected each node in 2.31 seconds Of course DG and random seed placement are faster than EMinG but as we saw in the Big Data Graph if we look for more than 30 extra seeds there are no signi“cant changes As we can see EMinGs computational time is related with the graph size because entropy ranking is calculated over all negative opinion nodes Finally The additional time in EMinG is for the greedy choice on top of the m  m  nodes VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK The in”uence maximization problem will continue to be studied from different points of view because the increasing interest in studying the interaction among members of social networks This is increasingly having a heavy impact in application development and gaming industry The proposed algorithm is based on simple algorithms and other simple techniques in order to be able to implement an highly scalable application for Big Data Of course the algorithm is still only trying to get an approximation to the optimal solution However the experiments showed the accuracy and high quality of the results of the proposed algorithm Additionally one the characteristics of the algorithm is the use of local information for increasing speed when dealing with large data sets In addition incorporating new ranking algorithms is quite simple because this phase was designed independently in the second phase of the proposed algorithm Also heuristics can be incorporated such as the ones applied in greedy algorithms to reduce the number of operations without loss of quality or the use of heuristics to choose the seed nodes In a future implementation many of the operations could be parallelized In addition we are working in developing new methods to analyze IM and mining large data streams to get faster results Finally for future applications we want to apply the proposed algorithm in no-social datasets to measure its effectiveness For example in biological sensor communication or networking datasets A CKNOWLEDGMENT We appreciate the nancial support given by CONACYT We want to thank computer science laboratory members for the tips reviews and recommendations over experiments and algorithms that were proposed Finally we want to thank people who are developing new algorithms new methods and new software which are the basis of this work R EFERENCES  M Shindler  A  W ong and A W  Me yerson F ast and accurate kmeans for large datasets in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 24  J Shawe-Taylor R Zemel P Bartlett F Pereira and K Weinberger Eds 2011 pp 2375…2383

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
