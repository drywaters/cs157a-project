In this paper, a greedy-based approach for hiding sensitive itemsets by inserting dummy transactions is proposed. It computes the maximal number of transactions to be inserted into the original database for totally hiding sensitive itemsets Experimental results are also performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach Keywords-privay preserving; insertion; dummy transaction data mining; sensitive itemsets I   I NTRODUCTION  As the data mining technology rapidly progresses, it is easier to get privacy information from user data through data mining technology. Privacy information includes some confidential information, such as income, medical history address, credit card numbers, phone number and customer purchasing behaviors, among others. Based on business purposes, some shard information among companies may be extracted and analyzed by other partners, which may not only decrease the benefits of the companies but also cause threats to sensitive data. In the past, many approaches have been proposed for handling the privacy-preserving data mining [4, 6, 8-10, 14 but  m o st o f t h e m  co nsi de red t o  partially delete the transactions or items within transactions for hiding sensitive itemsets. In real-world applications however, deleting the transactions from original database may cause the serious results in decision ma k ing In this paper, the greedy-based approach for inserting newly transactions into the original database is thus proposed. The empirical rules in standard normal distribution is respectively applied to determine the number of newly inserted transactions, the lengths of the inserted transactions and the itemsets to be added into the inserted transactions The proposed approach can thus easily ma k e good trade-offs between privacy preserving and execution time. Several experiments are respectively made to evaluate the performance of the execution time, the number of inserted transactions for hiding sensitive information, and the side effects of the proposed algorithm II  R ELATED W ORKS  In this session, the related wor k s of data mining and data sanitization are then respectively reviewed A  Data Mining Data mining is the most commonly used in attempts to induce association rules from transaction data, such that the presence of certain items in a transaction will imply the presence of some other items. To achieve this purpose, the Apriori algorithm [3 an d th e FP g row th alg o r ith m 7  ar e  recommended as the efficient approaches to derive frequent itemsets in association rules mining. The former one is a level-wise approach to generate-and-test candidates and the later one uses a tree structure to k eep the frequent itemsets without candidate generation, thus reducing the computational cost of rescanning database. In the Apriori algorithm, the database is recursively scanned to find the large \(frequent\ itemsets. All possible association combinations for each large itemset were formed, and those with calculated confidence values larger than the minimum confidence were output as the desired association rules B  Data Sanitization Years of effort in data mining have produced a variety of efficient techniques, which have caused the security problems and privacy threats T h e p r i v a c y p r e s er vi ng data mining \(PPDM\ technique s has thus become a critical research issue for hiding the confidential or secured information. In the past, Atallah et al. proposed the protection algorithm for data sanitization to avoid the inference of association rules [2  Das s e n i et  al th en  proposed a hiding algorithm based on the hamming-distance approach to reduce the confidence or support values of association rules Olive i ra  an d Z a   a n e 12 introd uc ed the multiple-rule hiding approach to efficiently hide sensitive itemsets. Amiri then proposed three heuristic algorithms to hide multiple sensitive rules [1  Po n t i k a k is et al. [13  th en  proposed two heuristics approaches based on data distortion Hong et al. proposed two approaches to partially delete the items within the transactions or the whole transactions from the original database for hiding sensitive itemsets [8-9   corresponding author 246 2011 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computin g 978-1-4577-0371-3/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 


III  A  G REEDY B ASED A LGORITHM  In this session, a greedy-based algorithm for data sanitization is then stated. The proposed algorithm maintains that the original frequent itemsets would be still frequent after the numbers of transactions are inserted for hiding sensitive itemsets. The proposed algorithm is then described below A  The Proposed Greedy-Based Algorithm INPUT  A transaction dataset  D  T 1  T 2  T m a set of k frequent itemsets  FI  fi 1  fi 2  fi k a set of l infrequent \(small\ itemsets I  i 1  i 2  i l a user-specified minimum support threshold  and a set of user-specified sensitive itemsets S  si 1  si 2  si j  si p   OUTPUT A sanitized dataset STEP 1 Calculate the value of maximum safety bound  MSB for the number of newly inserted transactions as   1   1            m si SB max n i i p i   where SB i is the safety bound of each sensitive itemset m is the number of original transactions in D  i si is the count of sensitive itemset si i   STEP 2 Calculate the length p n of each inserted transaction in d according to the empirical rules in standard normal distribution, where d  d 1  d 2  d n and n is the number of inserted transactions obtained in STEP 1 STEP 3 Choose the itemsets to be inserted into each inserted transaction d n Do the substeps as follows Substep 3-1 Calculate the count difference  CD fi each frequent itemset to be possibly inserted into the new transactions as        n m fi CD k fi k     where k fi is the count\(frequency\of an item fi k  m is the number of transactions in D and n is the number of transactions in d  Substep 3-2 Put the frequent itemsets fi k with negative k fi CD into the set of Insert_Items Substep 3-3 Sort the fi k in the set of Insert_Items in descending order of their lengths Substep 3-4 Sort the sorted results obtained in substep 3-3 in descending order of their k fi CD  STEP 4  Process the inserted transactions d n one-by-one respectively to add the fi k in the set of Insert_Items according to the sorted order obtained in substep 3-4. Note that the length of an inserted itemset fi k is no longer than p n  in d n and the inserted itemset fi k in a transaction cannot be formed as any super-itemsets of a sensitive itemset in S  STEP 5 Update \(decrease\e value and the corresponding sub-itemsets of the processed itemset fi k by 1 STEP6 Repeat the STEPs 4 to 5 until the set of Insert_Items is null or there is no longer itemsets to be inserted into d n obtained the constraints in STEP 4 STEP 7 Add the small items in the set of I into the d n  while d n remains positions to be added according to empirical rules in standard normal distribution B  An Example In this section, an example is then used to illustrate the proposed algorithm step-by-step. Assume a database shown in Table 1 is used as an example. It consists of 8 transactions with 7 items, denoted a to g  TABLE I  A  D ATABASE WITH 8  T RANSACTIONS  TID Item TID Item 1 a, b, c, d, e 5 b, g 2 a, b, c, e 6 b, d, e, f 3 c, e 7 a, b, c, d 4 a, b, c, e 8 b, c, e, f  Assume the user-specified sensitive itemsets in the set of S are c 6 be 5 abc 4}, and the minimum support threshold is set at 50%. The minimum count is calculated as \(0.5*8 4\. The Apriori-li k e approach is then executed to find all frequent itemsets and the results are then shown in Table 2 Note the sensitive itemsets are mar k ed in yellow color in Table 2 TABLE II  A LL L ARGE I TEMSETS  All items Large 1-itemset Large 2-itemset & 3-itemset Item Count Item Count Item Count a 4 a 4 ab 4 b 7 b 7 ac 4 c 6 c 6 bc 5 d 3 e 6 be 5 e 6  ce 5 f 2   abc 4 g 1  bce 4  STEP 1 The number of inserted transactions in this example is first calculated. In this example, there are 3 sensitive itemsets to be hidden. The maximum safety bound MSB among three sensitive itemsets is thus calculated as 5 indicating the number of newly inserted transactions STEP 2 For five inserted transactions obtained in STEP 1, the length of each transaction is thus computed according to empirical rules in standard no rmal distribution. That is the probability of length 2, 3, 4, and 5 are calculated as 247 


13.5%, 34%, 34%, 13.5%\ The lengths of five inserted transactions of TID 9 to 13 are then respectively set at {4, 3 4, 2, 3 STEP 3 The count difference of each frequent itemset in Table 2 is then respectively calculated. The results are then shown in Table 3 TABLE III  T HE C OUNT D IFFERENCES OF A LL F REQUENT I TEMSETS  Large 1-itemset Large 2-itemset Large 3-itemset Item CD Item CD Item CD a 3 ab 3 bce 3 b 0 ac 3   e 1 bc 2    ce 2    In Table 3, only the itemsets with negative CD will be considered as the itemsets for insertion and sorted according to their lengths and CD value. After that, the sorted results are then put into the set of Insert_Items  bce 3 ab 3 ac 3 bc 2 ce 2 a 3 STEP 4, 5 & 6 The itemsets are then respectively added into the transactions 9 to 13 acco rding the sorted order in the set of Insert_Items The corresponding sub-itemsets are then also updated \(decreased\ The greedy procedure is terminated while there are no more spaces for inserting the frequent itemsets STEP 7 The small items are then alternative selected by empirical rules in stand normal distribution to insert into the transactions with remaining spaces. The updated database of this example is then shown in Table 4  TABLE IV  T HE U PDATED D ATABASE  TID Item 1 a, b, c, d, e 2 a, b, c, e 3 c, e 4 a, b, c, e 5 b, g 6 b, d, e, f 7 a, b, c, d 8 b, c, e, f 9 b, c, e, g 10 b, c, e 11 b, c, e, f 12 a, b 13 a, b, g  IV  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  Experiments were made to show the performance of the proposed approach. Three database BMS-POS, Webview-1 Webview-2 are then compared to show the performance of the proposed approach [16 Th e  n u m b e rs o f  sen sitiv e  itemsets are then defined by the percentages of the frequent itemsets in the databases, which is more flexible to see the performance of the proposed algorithm For the proposed greedy-based algorithm, the relationships between the numbers of inserted transactions the execution, and the side effects are then compared in three different databases. The numbers of newly inserted transactions are then computed for three different databases show in Figure 1   Figure 1  Numbers of added transactions In Figure 1, it is obvious to see that the BMS-POS database requires more transactions to be inserted since it contains more information \(transactions\han the others That is because more sensitive itemsets are required to be hidden due to the number of sensitive itemsets are calculated by the percentage of frequent itemsets The side effects of the proposed greedy-based approach are also evaluated, including the hiding failure for the number of sensitive itemsets, the number of the missing nonsensitive itemsets, and the number of artificial itemsets. The results are then shown in Figure 2. From Figure 2, it is obvious to see that the proposed greedy-based approach can thus totally hide the sensitive itemsets without any side effects   Figure 2  The evaluation of three side effects in Webview-1 V  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, a greedy-based algorithm for inserting newly transactions into the original database for efficiently hiding the sensitive itemsets is thus proposed. The empirical 248 


rule in standard normal distribution is used to evaluate the numbers of newly inserted transactions and the lengths of the transactions. In the proposed algorithm, the large itemsets in the original database are respectively added into the inserted transactions, for reducing the side effects of missing rules The small items are also added into the inserted transactions with the remaining spaces to be filled. Experimental results are then shown the performance of the proposed greedybased approach for inserting new transactions R EFERENCES  1  A.

can be explained that, with the increase in the number of transactions, the denominator of generating frequent process item set becomes bigger, and then lead to the frequent process item set becomes smaller, and so does strong associated rules number. And the time increases too, with the increase in the number of transactions   Figure 5. Number of transactions and efficiency From these experiments, we can see that the efficiency of our recommending system is proportional to the size of transaction, and inverse to the size of process item set and the number of transactions. The time of generating result is proportional to the number of transactions, but not related to the other two factors basically VI  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  In this paper, we propose a new process recommendation approach based on the association rules and transaction context to mine the associated relationship between processes so that to help organizations and users to improve their work efficiency. And then we describe the algorithm of realizing this model in details However, there exist some limitations for the current model and algorithm, which need further studies in future 1  The method that we propose to mine he associated relationship is only based on the association rules and transaction context. And we can try other methods to mine in future, for example, collaborative filtering and so on 2  The algorithm to mine associated rules in Section 4 is not so good both in time complexity or space complexity. On the other hand, when some new records are added to the process library, the algorithm will need to calculate again from beginning to obtain the new associated rules. This efficiency is quite low, and we would do something to improve the algorithm performance A CKNOWLEDGMENT   Research was supported by the National Key Science and Technology Research Program of China \(No.2011ZX01039-001002 and No.2009ZX01043-003-003\ and the National Supporting Science and Technology Research Program of China\(No.2008BAH27B00  R EFERENCES  1  M.

Target values have different meanings for different data mining problems Now, let us consider the application of strati?ed sampling and Neyman allocation to differential rule mining and association mining. For differential rule mining in the form of A = a D1\(t t D1\(t t denote the number of data records sampled across the strata, and ni denote the number of data records drawn from the ith stratum The size of population containing tuples under the space of A = a is denoted by Ni for the ith stratum. Now, let the expression y denote D1\(t t average of the ith stratum. Then, using strati?ed sampling, the mean value of y is estimated as ys H i=1 Ni N yi \(1 It turns out that ys is an unbiased estimation , which implies that E\(ys y variance for ys is 2s H i=1 N2i N2  ni 2 i \(2 In the stratum whose variance is unknown, ?2i is estimated by 326 sample variance, i.e S2i  y2ij ni   yij ni  


Here, yij is a sampled record from the ith stratum These expressions are also applied to association rule mining in the form of A = a ? Y , with the goal being to estimate the con?dence supports\(A=a?Y A=a the expression y to denote whether Y is contained in the data record under the space of A = a: if the data record under space of A = a contains Y , let y = 1; otherwise, y = 0. The con?dence for the association rule is calculated by estimating the mean value of y based on Expression 1, and the variance of estimation for the con?dence over the entire population is still calculated by Expression 2 Formally, with Neyman allocation, the sample allocation can be stated as ni n j=1Nj?j Ni?i \(3 where ?i are calculated as described above While Neyman Allocation ef?ciently reduces the variance of estimation, it does not consider the sampling cost in the deep web. Speci?cally, sampling cost is de?ned as the number of queries submitted to deep web data sources in order to obtain a ?xed number of data records under the particular space. We assume that for each query submitted to the deep web, a single data record is obtained. In the process of sampling data records corresponding to A = a over the deep web, the probability of A = a in each stratum is not considered in Neyman allocation \(or other existing methods that a large sample might have to be drawn from a stratum where the probability of a data element satisfying A = a is small. This will result in a high sampling cost The following example shows the inef?ciency of Neyman Allocation in the case of differential rule mining on the deep web. For a rule A = a ?

The columns one through four of the Table I show the stratum ID, population size \(Ni of D1\(t t being true in any given record in this stratum TABLE I EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION OF NEYMAN ALLOCATION FOR DEEP WEB MINING ID Size Variance Probability of A = a Sample size

According to the Expression 2, the resulting estimation is 66.67, and the estimated sampling cost is 3361.1. In this example, the sampling cost is very high, because a large sample is allocated to the stratum 3, which happens to have a low probability of A = a. If we could allocate a smaller sample to the stratum 3 and a larger sample to the strata 1 and 2, the sampling costs would be decreased, though possibly with some increase in the sampling variance C. Our Approach As we stated in the previous section, randomly constructing and submitting queries can not ensure that the output results contain data records within the space of A = a. Thus, ef?ciently acquiring samples under the space of output attribute A = a and accurately estimating the parameters \(con?dence or mean value challenging problems Since sampling on the deep web can only be performed by constructing and submitting queries, strati?cation needs to be performed on the query space, i.e., involving input attributes only. In order to ef?ciently acquire samples under the space of a speci?c value of an output attribute \(i.e. A = a between input attributes and output attributes is important. In other words, we need to know which input queries are more likely to yield output web pages containing tuples under the space of A = a. Furthermore, in order to accurately estimate the parameters \(con?dence or mean value under the space of A = a, similar values of target attributes under A = a are required to be in the same group. For this purpose we are proposing a greedy strati?cation method. Our method considers both ef?ciency and accuracy, so that input queries that are more likely to yield output web pages containing tuples under the space of A = a are identi?ed, and similar values of target attributes under A = a are grouped in the same sub-population In our approach, the relation of input attribute and output attribute as well as the data distribution of target attributes are learnt from the pilot sample The second component of our approach is a novel sample 


allocation method. To ef?ciently acquire samples under the space of output attribute A = a, large sample should be drawn from the query subspace that is more likely to yield output web pages containing tuples under the space of A = a. On the other side, to accurately estimate the parameters \(con?dence or mean value target attributes under the space of A = a, a large sample should be drawn from the query subspace that has a larger variance of the target value under the space of A = a. We have developed an optimized sample allocation algorithm which integrates the two aspects \(ef?ciency and accuracy IV. MAIN TECHNICAL APPROACH In this section, we introduce our strati?ed sampling approach in the context of association rule mining and differential rule mining on deep web data sources. As we stated earlier, our approach comprises of a strati?cation method and a sample allocation method. These are described in the next two subsections. Towards the end of this section, we describe how differential rule mining can be performed using these two methods A. A Greedy Strati?cation Method Strati?cation refers to partitioning the population being sampled. Traditional strati?cation methods such as Recursive strati?ed sampling [22], [8] aim at grouping similar values into the 327 Algorithm 1 Strati?cation\(N,Q, PS, s, Lf 1: Cost\(N N N 2: if Cost\(N 3:  integrated cost is smaller than 4: Lf = Lf ?N 5: else 6:  partition the query space of N 7: splitCost ? maxV alue 8: M ? null 9: for all IA ?

19: for all mi ? DM do 20: Strati?cation\(CHi, Q ? {M = mi}, PS ?M,asi, Lf 21: end for 22: end if same subpopulation, in order to maximally reduce variance of estimation. As we have stated previously, two related issues make the sampling for a deep web data source different. The ?rst is because of the limited access to the database, i.e., samples can only be obtained by querying through a simple interface Thus, obtaining additional samples meeting A = a is non-trivial Second, ef?ciency of sampling is an important consideration since each deep web query is slowed down due to the data delivery delay between the server and the client We now describe our greedy strati?cation method which partitions the population of the deep web recursively. Strati?cation is performed on the query space composed of input attributes in the query interface. In other words, the population of a deep web source can be considered to correspond to the entire query space, and the subpopulations correspond to query subspaces More precisely, a subpopulation comprises of the data records that can be obtained by submitting queries from the corresponding subspace To establish this correspondence, the relationship between input attributes and output attributes is learnt from the pilot sample. In this fashion, the subpopulations or strata that are more likely to contain tuples where A = a is true are identi?ed. We de?ne sampling cost to be the estimated number of data records that will need to be drawn from the deep web, in order to obtain a speci?ed number of records where A = a is true. Let ?i represents the probability of ?nding a data record with A = a in the stratum i. This value can be estimated based on the pilot sample. Thus, to obtain ni data records where A = a is true in ith stratum, the estimated number of data records drawn from ith stratum is ni?i . Overall, in order to obtain our desired n data records where A = a is true from the entire population, the estimated sampling cost will be SampCost  i ni i 4 


While focusing on the sample cost and using the strata that are more likely to contain tuples where A = a is clearly important, variance of estimation is another important issue, since it corresponds to the error of estimation. Thus, we de?ne the integrated cost by taking into account the variance of estimation 2s and the sampling cost SampCost Cost = ?s  SampCost + ?v  ?2s \(5 where ?s and ?v are weights for sampling cost and estimate variance, respectively, such that their sum is 1. Users could set the two weights based on the importance they attach to these two factors. For example, if response to a query is needed quickly sampling cost should have a higher weightage The relation between input attributes and output attributes, as well as data distribution, are modeled by a tree built on the query space recursively. Each node in the tree represents a query subspace, and is associated with a query that comprises speci?c values for a subset of input attributes, the sample size, as well as the potential splitting attributes. The sample size shows how many data records would be drawn from the subpopulation of the node Algorithm 1 shows the process of splitting a node N , which as we stated above, is associated with the query Q, the sample size s, and a list of potential splitting attributes, PS. The inputs of the algorithm also include set Lf , which represents leaf nodes of the tree. At the beginning, the entire query space is represented by the root node. The corresponding query of the root node is null the sample size n is the size of the sample that is to be drawn from the entire population, and the potential splitting attributes list is the complete set of input attributes of this data source. The initial set of leaf nodes is empty The main goal of the algorithm is to split the query tree in a greedy way. For each potential splitting attribute, the integrated cost after splitting is computed according to the Expression 5. The input attribute which brings the most reduction in the integrated cost is selected. More speci?cally, ?rst, the integrated cost for the subpopulation of the node N is calculated. If this value is smaller than a prede?ned threshold ?, node N is set to be a leaf node \(Lines 2-5 considering the set of potential splitting attributes PS \(Lines 621 would be |DIA| strata under the space of node N . The integrated cost on |DIA| strata is computed. Let M ? PS with domain DM 


denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
