This proposed paper is an improved version of apriori algorithm that is focused on four features namely, First data prepar ation and select the required data, second generate itemsets that determines the rule constraints for knowledge, third mine k-frequent itemsets using the new database and fourth generate the proposed association rule that establishes the knowledge base and provide better results compared to existing method.

Expert system is structured in to four parts: knowledge base, inference engine, knowledge acquisition and explaining interface with the knowledge base and inference engine as its kernel Association rule mining is an important technique of data mining area. It is used to search for interesting relationship among items in a large transaction database. Boolean association rule mining is more widely used than other kinds of association rule mining. Existing Apriori algorithm presents an improved association rule mining algorithm which avoids the two frequent \(k ñ 1\tem if they have the same \(k-2\ems in front. Association rule mining process can be completed in four steps. First data preparation and select the required data, second generate itemsets that determines the rule constraints for knowledge, third mine kfrequent itemsets using the new database and fourth generate the proposed association rule that establishes the knowledge base using the proposed algorithm  Therefore, in this work an improved algorithm to mine association rules was presented and the support and confidence were redefined The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 define the basic concepts of data, association rules and apriori algorithm and an example is given. The literature review on mining frequent itemsets algorithm is discussed in section 3. The proposed model is explained in section 4 Finally, the conclusion is given in section 5 II  B ASI C CONCEPTS  A  Data De finition Data mining is nothing but, the extract of knowledge from databases, which is classification [1  In data m i n i n g  field, the data are processed information or implicit meaning Data generally by organized in tables that contain a set of complete database environment  t a bl e can be l o oke d like a matrix Each matrix row represents an instance that is associated with a test case to analyse.

C  Algorithm Apriori Consider an example transaction database DB given in Table II. In Apriori, in each iteration \(or each pass\ it constructs a candidate set of large itemsets, counts the number of occurrences of each candidate itemset, and then determines large itemsets based on a pre-determined minimum support. In the first iteration, Apriori simply scans all the transactions to count the number of occurrences for each item. The set of candidate 1-itemsets, C1, obtained is shown in Fig.1. Assuming that the minimum transaction support required is 2 \(i.e., s =40%\e set of large 1itemsets, L1, composed of candidate 1-itemsets with the minimum support required can then be determined. To discover the set of large 2-itemsets, in view of the fact that any subset of a large itemset must also have minimum support, Apriori uses L1 * L1 to generate a candidate set of itemsets C2, where * is an operation for concatenation in this case. C2 consists of    2 1 L 2-ite msets. Next, the four transactions in DB are scanned and the support of each candidate itemset in C2 is counted. The middle table of the second row in Fig.1 represents the result form such counting in C2. The set of large 2-itemsets, L2, is therefore determined based on the support of each candidate 2-itemset in C2 TA BLE II  A N E XAMPLE TRANSACTION DATABASE DB F OR DATA MINING  TID Items 10 0 A C D 2 00 B C E 3 00 A B C E 40 0 B E The set o f candidate itemsets, C3, is generated from L2 as follows. From L2, two large 2-itemsets with the same first item, such {B, C} and {B, E}, are identified first. Then Apriori tests whether the 2-itemset {C, E}, which consists of their second items, constitutes a large 2-itemset or not. Since C, E} is a large itemset by itself, we know that all the subsets of {B, C, E} are large and then {B, C, E} becomes a candidate 3-itemset. There are no other candidate 3-itemsets from L2. Apriori then scans all the transactions and discovers the large 3-itemsets L3 in Fig.1. Since there is no candidate 4-itemset to be constituted from L3, Apriori ends the process of discovering large itemsets    C 1  L 1     Scan D  Itemset Sup A  B C D E 2 3 3 1 3  It emset Sup A  B C E 2 3 3 3  C 2  C 2 L 2  It emset A B A C A E B C B E C E   Scan D   Itemset Sup A B A C A E B C B E C E 1 2 1 2 3 2  It emset Sup A C B C B E C E 2 2 3 2  C 3  C 3 L 3  Ite mset B C E  Scan D  Itemset Sup B C E} 2  Ite mset Sup B C E 2  Fig ure 1  Generation of candidate itemsets and large itemsets II I  LITE RATURE REVIEW ON ALGORITHM FOR MINING FREQUENT ITEMSETS  I n 2000, Attila Gyenesei put forward an important method of mining association rules for market analysis [1 6 The Tr ad i t i o n al ass o cia t i on rule m i ni n g al g o r ith m s c a n only be used to data mining problems with categorical attribute. For a data mining problem with quantitative attribute, it is necessary to transform each quantitative attribute into discrete intervals. The first is mining frequent itemsets with Apriori, and then producing association rules according to the frequent itemsets mine Agrawal explain this with good example and implementing association rules method in the customer transac Apriori i s  us ing c i r c ulat ory gen e r atio n f o r  searching frequent itemsets that produces \(k+1\msets from k ñ itemsets   LI Pingxiang [1 p r op ose d a m e th od  exp l or es the  database to filter frequent 1-itemsets and then it obtains the candidate frequent 2-itemset, 3-itemsets up to n-itemset by evaluating their probabilities in Equation HUANG Liusheng c overi ng  a ne w  algor i t h m  BitMatrix, This algorithm is compared with the previously known algorithms, the Apriori and AprioriTid algorithms The main task  o f e v e r y  as soci at io n  r u le m i n i ng algorithm is to discover the sets of items that frequently appear togetheróthe frequent itemsets. The number of database scans required for the task has been reduced from a number equal to the size of the largest itemset in Apriori By analying Carlos Ordone a l pr obl e m s c o m e  up when trying to discover association rules in a high dimensional data set  This p aper [15 i nd o u t an d addr ess t h e p r ob le m o f  constraint-based rule mining in dense data. For example most association rule miners allow users to set an alternative measure such as lift \(Berry and Linoff, 1997; International Business Machines, 1996\ or conviction \(Brin et al., 1997 Then, this paper pointed out additional measures for identifying interesting rules, including lift and conviction Both lift and conviction represent the predictive advantage a rule offers over simply guessing based on the frequency of the consequent Daniel kunkle [17 f o cuse d t h ree possi ble str a i g ht f orwar d  solutions. First, mine all frequent generalized itemsets, and then eliminate the non-max ones. Second, mine max frequent itemsets in the ordinary case and third choice is to dynamically browse the lattice of all generalized itemsets The existing works tried to finding the strong rules but in such works didnít give the expected rules. Some of the findings made from the previous works are   Need several iterations of data   Rule complexity, Irrelevant rules for predictive purposes, Association rules having irrelevant or 7 


redundant groups of items and Weak implication and large number of   Mine all frequent generalized itemsets solution is extremely inefficient and, in practical cases infeasible   Lift and Conviction measures still fail to fully enforce Occamís razor [15, 16   As a consequence to overcome the above said drawbacks our proposal method is based on four features namely, First data preparation and select the required data, second generate itemsets that determines the rule constraints for knowledge third mine k-frequent itemsets using the new database and fourth generate the proposed association rule that establishes the knowledge base, it will produce strong association rules which satisfy both minimum support degree \(min_sup\and the minimum confidence degree \(min_conf IV  P ROPOS ED M ETHODOLO GY  To overcome the above said drawback the proposed method incorporates the following model   For each frequent itemsets F, all subsets of F, i.e., F 1 can be produced   Each non-null subset F1  of F, generates an association rule  F  F   F 1 1  if itís confidence degree is not less than min_conf. This is the model algorithm of association rules. Here, this method is modified in order to build up the knowledge database of expert system A  Establishing the knowledge database The proposed algorithm is focused on four features which are expressed as follows 1  The task of data preparation is to transform raw transaction data according to the required structure and transfer the transformed data to the mining database. In general, the data used by rule mining are transaction data i.e., the training data set by eliminating the unwanted fields/data \(like student name, reg.no, age, address.ect from transaction database and select the required data 2  Generate itemsets that determines the rule constraints for knowledge 3  Mine k-frequent itemsets using the new database 4  Generate the proposed association rule that establishes the knowledge base using the proposed algorithm Fig. 2 shows the step by step process of the proposed model The proposed methodology is validated using student habitation expert system, where using the certain criteriaís weather disease occurs or not is identify. First, to preprocessing the transaction data, then select the required data The following data is got from college student habitation  1 below 1 litre , soft drinks, tawa fry, vegetarian  Ulce r 2 below 1 litre , soft drinks, tawa fry, vegetarian  Ulce r 3 3 to 5 litres, beverages, tawa fry, non-vegetarian  Ob esity 4 1 to 3 litres, hot drinks, tawa fry, vegetarian  Acidit y 5 1 to 3 litres , beverages, boiled, non-vegetarian  Acid ity 6 1 to 3 litres, hot drinks, fast food, vegetarian  Obesity 7 1 to 3 litres , soft drinks, fast food, non-vegetarian  Acidity  8 1 to 3 litres , beverages, boiled, non-vegetarian   Acidity 9 3 to 5 litres, hot drinks, fast food, non-vegetarian  Ob esity 10 below 1 litre, beverages, tawa fry, non-vegetarian  Ulce r 11 below 1 litre, hot drinks, boiled, vegetarian  U lcer 12 below 1 litre , soft drinks, tawa fry, vegetarian  Ulce r 13 1 to 3 litres, hot drinks, tawa fry, vegetarian  Acidity 14  3 to 5 litres, beverages, tawa fry, non-vegetarian  Obe sity 15 1 to 3 litres, hot drinks, tawa fry, vegetarian  Acidity 16 below 1 litre, beverages, fast food, non-vegetarian  Ulc er 17 3 to 5 litres, beverages, tawa fry, non-vegetarian  Obe sity 18 1 to 3 litres , beverages, boiled, non-vegetarian  A cidity 19 1 to 3 litres, hot drinks, fast food, vegetarian   Obesity 20 1 to 3 litres, hot drinks, fast food, vegetarian  Obe sity B  It em Generation Establishing the knowledge database for student habitation expert system is based on solid and liquid food consumption habitation data. In order to use the apriori, plain water, liquid intake, solid intake, type of intake and disease name are considered as the items that cause diseases and is being named as: a, b, c, d and e respectively. Because each cause of disease has several different conditions \(we call them cause values\he different conditions are also numbered. In this way, we take the form of ìcause of disease name following the cause value numberî to subdivide the item. For example  a1 \(here ìaì is cause of disease name following ì1 is cause value number\esult is as follows a.  Plain water: a1, below 1LT; a2, 1 to 3 LT; a3 3 to 5 LT b. Liquid Intake: b1 soft drinks; b2, Beverages; b3,hotdrinks c.  Solid Intake: c1, tawa fry ; c2, fast food; c3, boiled d.  Type of Intake: d1, vegetarian; d2, non-vegetarian e.

Next, we are going to take subdivided item that is ìcause of disease name following cause value numberî as the final item which is operated by apriori. After the preparation of these items, we begin to mine the frequent item with Apriori Here, we assume the min_sup and the min_conf are one and the same The initial database DB from the experience data is as follows \(Table III T ABLE III  I NITIAL DATABASE  DB  ID Item 001  a1, b1, c1, d1, e1 002  a1, b1, c1, d1, e1 003  a3, b2, c1, d2, e3 004  a2, b3, c1, d1, e2 005 a2, b2, c3, d2, e2 006  a2, b3, c2, d1, e3 007  a2, b1, c2, d2, e2 008  a2, b2, c3, d2, e2 009  a3, b3, c2, d2, e3 010  a1, b2, c1, d2, e1 011 a1, b3, c3, d1, e1 012  a1, b1, c1, d1, e1 013  a2, b3, c1, d1, e2 014  a3, b2, c1, d2, e3 015  a2, b3, c1, d1, e2 016 a1, b2, c2, d2, e1 017  a3, b2, c1, d2, e3 018  a2, b2, c3, d2, e3 019  a2, b3, c2, d1, e3 020 a2, b3, c2, d1, e3 C  Mine frequent k_itemsets  Apriori algorithm is used to scan the database to obtain candidate 1-itemsets, then, select it by min-sup 1 and you can get frequent 1 ñ item. As follows \(table ñ IV TA BLE IV  F REQUEN T 1  ITE MSETS  It em a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 c1 Support degr ee 6 10 4 4 8 8 10 It em c2 c3 d1 d2 e1 e2 e3 Support degr ee 6 4 10 10 6 6 8  The association rule of the model Apriori algorithm links the two frequent \(k ñ 1\ñ item if they have the same \(k-2 items in front. For example: link  ìa2, b3, c1î and ìa2, b3 c2î, we can get ìa2, b3, c1, c2î. However they are not linked while we build up knowledge database. This is becauseîc1 and ìc2î are two different values of one cause.\(They both describe the solid intake of food habitation\. They repel each other, so if is impossible for them to exist simultaneously Therefore, we donít link them together. Thus, after the linking work, and through the selection of the min-sup 1, we can get the frequent k ñ itemsets which satisfies both minconf and min-sup. For the above example of  cause of diseases, we can get the frequent 5 ñ itemsets finally, using the modifying Apriori algorithm. As follows\(table V It couldnít produce new frequent itemsets any more in after mining out the frequent 5 ñ itemsets, so the algorithm ends. The following job is to make association rules from the frequent itemsets we have got TA BLE V  F REQUENT 5   ITEMSETS  It em a1, b1, c1, d1, e1 a3, b2, c1, d2, e3 Support degr ee 3 3 It em a2, b3, c1, d1, e2 a2, b2, c3, d2, e2 Support degr ee 3 2 It em a2, b3, c2, d1, e3 a2, b1, c2, d2, e2 Support degr ee 3 1 It em a3, b3, c2, d2, e3 a1, b2, c1, d2, e1 Support degr ee 1 1 It em a1, b3, c3, d1, e1 a1, b2, c2, d2, e1 Support degr ee 1 1 Item a2, b2, c3, d2, e3  Support degr ee 1 D  M odel association rules Generation The proposed association algorithm, finds out all non_null subsets of frequent itemsets F. For each subset F 1  if the confidence degree is not less than min-conf an association rule  F  F   F 1 1  i s produced The process of the knowledge database establishment decision rule is rather needed than association rule. In other words, the focal point, which pay close attention to is not the associate relationship of attributes, but the results of the combination of them. Therefore, only need to calculate the confidence degree of the subset besides the decision resultís for example, to the frequent itemsets ìa2, b3, c2, d1, e3î, we only need to calculate the confidence degree of ìa2, b3, c2 d1î, that is say f 1 a2 b3, c2 and d1î\(Because e3 is the decision result item:disease name\. So, when it satisfies the rule that its confidence is more than min-conf. we can produce the rule that is e3   c2  b3  2  i.e   F  F   F 1 1    At last compared with the primary attribute number, we can get the comprehensive rule Obesity   vegetarian   food fast   drinks hot   litres  3  to 1      This mean is that if the cause of disease has 1 to 3 litres and hot drinks and fast food and high cholestral vegetarian the disease might be Obesity\he rules of the above mentioned cause of diseases example is as follows Rule form: \(name sup as support degree and conf as confidence degree 1  below 1 litre , soft drinks, tawa fry, vegetarian  Ulcer sup: 0.15, conf:1 2 3 to 5 litres, beverages, tawa fry, non-vegetarian  Obesity s up:0.15, conf:1 3 1 to 3 litres, hot drinks, tawa fry, vegetarian  Acidity sup: 0.1, conf:1 4 1 to 3 litres , beverages, boiled, non-vegetarian  Acidity s up: 0.15, conf:0.67 5 1 to 3 litres, hot drinks, fast food, vegetarian  Obes ity sup: 0.15, conf:1 9

For example rules 6,7,8,9,10 minimum support is 0.05, rules 1,2,4,5,11 minimum support is 0.15 and rule 3 minimum support 0.1. as well as minimum confidence of all rules is 1 except 4 and 11 Fig. 4 illustrates the performance analysis for the test data set. The results show that proposed Algorithm has better performance comparing to Apriori Algorithm At last the knowledge database of the expert system is established and stores all the rules into the database. Thus according to the rules table in the knowledge database, the system can output the homologous decision rules after the customer inputs some cause of disease V  C ON CLUSIONS  The proposed algorithm used in mining the training data set, which can discover implicit and potential useful knowledge from large preprocessed databases. This paper provides the better knowledge base of the expert system and concludes the role of association rule in discussion. Then this method is also used in other fields like agricultural sector, health sector and clinical research areas. So it is a better method for establishing knowledge base in expert system R EFE RENCES  1  Hamid Mohamadlou,îA method for mining association rules in quantitative and fuzzy dataî ,978-1-4244-4136-5/09, IEEE,pp.453 458 Year of Publication 2009 2  Agrawal R, Srikant R.

 source version. For our system, we used SwiftOWLIM, which has some limitations compared to BigOWLIM. For example, it doesnêt ensure the detection of contradictions   Every OWL ontology has some limitations regarding to the number of triples. The maximum number of triples, in such ontology can be 300-500 millions of triples, depending on the process of inference  Opportunities   Using OWLIM, we make our ontology and our detected association rules public. In this way they become interconnected with other sources from the Internet. Using the REST interface of Sesame, anybody can read or download our ontology. We can do in the same way with other sources from the Internet, we can merge our ontology with other ontologies generating new knowledge. The presented system allows semantic search of the concepts. It represents an open knowledge base   It opens the possibilities for pragmatic web where software agents can search, and even make shopping in the name of a person Threats   Nowadays, there is a relatively small number of companies, which adopt Semantic Web technologies. One reason is that the current systems use relational databases for storing and managing data. Mapping a relational database in an RDF knowledge base may require further works   Ontologies generate heterogeneous knowledge which supports semantic contradictions Semantic Web promotes the principle of AAAé \(Anyone can say Anything About Anything\This means, that anybody can define concepts and relationships between those concepts, according to his/her personal goals This may generate semantic conflicts and contradictions. Any contradiction may produce inconsistencies and will affect the ability of software \(agents, browsers, search engines, etc in the execution of decisions VI  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT  The motivation for this research came from the limitations of traditional recommender systems. Building an effective recommender system is challenging. We believe that ontology is a good solution for modeling product and user data In the presented paper we described how can we use OWLIM custom rule-set in order to eliminate some of the shortcomings of a recommender system based on Apriori algorithm. To manage the product and user data, we applied to OWL ontology, which was uploaded in OWLIM semantic repository, thereby we could improve our system using the facilities offered by OWLIM. We applied to semantic web techniques to obtain an open, public ontology which allows interoperability As a future work, we would like to extend this system to an open recommender system using Linked Data. We can combine the described model with Liked Data. The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the we order to build a standardized system for publishing his data and connecting it to other data sources, we will follow the Linked Data principles w h ic h s p eci fy  h o w  to u s e t h e  different standards together A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research presented in this paper is supported by the Gazepower project \(E-marketing and software quality management based on eye tracking analysis, code 2443/2009 funded by UEFISCSU-CNCSIS through the National Research Program IDEI R EFERENCES  1  L.

i in the next step. ? and ? are the parameters that control the level of consideration of the pheromone trail D. The algorithm of ABSSR In the following, we present our approach in the form of the algorithm. We suppose that the user is using service S and he wants to stop it Step 1: Service Cluster Selection Based on the service S, we know the service cluster of S is sc1. The cluster selection list is generated using association rules. Suppose the user selects sc2 as the cluster of next service Step 2: Parameters Initialization This step is pre-processing, in which the parameters of and Q are initialized for ant colony navigation model. Moreover, a time window for frequency is set Step 3: Heuristic Information Calculation The heuristic information ? is evaluated according to the connectedness between S and some feasible services in sc2 Suppose there are n services denoted as S1, S2, . . . , Sn, can be as the next selection from service S, a set of heuristic information {?SS1 , ?SS2 , . . . , ?SSn} is calculated using Eq.\(1 Step 4: Pheromone Trail Intensity Calculation 0 5 10 15 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 The connectedness between the service  i  and service  j   P ij Fig. 3.

  P ij Fig. 6. Pij variations with the increment of reputationij Based on the attributes of service \(distance, frequency and reputation SS1 , ?SS2 , . . . , ?SSn} is calculated, according to Eqs.\(2-4 Step 5: Probability Calculation and Service Selection In this step the set of probability {PSS1 , PSS2 , . . . , PSSn are calculated on the basic of {?SS1 , ?SS2 , . . . , ?SSn} and SS1 , ?SS2 , . . . , ?SSn} using Eq.\(5 is generated in decreasing order of {PSS1 , PSS2 , . . . , PSSn Suppose that the user selects service S? in the list as the next service he wants Step 6: Updating After the user selects a service S? in the service selection list, the values of three attributes should be updated, including the connectedness between service S and S?, frequencyS and reputationS IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To evaluate the effectiveness of ABSSR, we utilize attributebased service recommendation to test the proposed ant colony navigation model. In the model, the probability in ant colony KB is related to the values of attributes of services Experiment 1: In this experiment, the impact on the probability from different values of the heuristic information ?ij In Eq.\(1 i to j. Without lose of generality, we set Cij from 1 to 15 In addition, in the service cluster of service j, there are four other services as the next service of service i, and they are set randomly between 1 and 15 With the parameters ? = 1 and ? = 8, the probability variation is illustrated in Fig. 3. From the result, with the same pheromone trail intensity, the more Cij is, the higher Pij is Experiment 2: In experiment 2, based on the same heuristic information ?ij, the relationship between Pij and the attributes will be analyzed. The change of attributes will impact on pheromone trail intensity ?ij. In the ABSSR, three attributes are considered: distance, frequency and reputation. If all of the attributes are inconsistent in the experiment, the results are confused. Consequently, we observe one attribute with 


two other remaining attributes be constant. To protect the same order among attributes, we fixed the parameters ? = 10 2500, ? = 1000, ? = 2 and ? = 1 In Fig. 4, the distance between the service i and j is increased from 1 to 5 \(kilometers attributes. From the figure, we can observe that the probability is decreased with the increment of the distanceij, and vice versa. Similarly, we varied the values of the frequencyj and reputationj to analyze the influence of Pij \(frequencyj is from 1 to 50, and reputationj is from 1 to 100 given in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The probability has an increase corresponding to the growths of frequencyj and reputationj V. CONCLUSION As the number of the users of networks has been increased greatly nowadays, the proactive service recommendation in m-commerce becomes an important issue. It is computed by the contextual information from sensor nodes. Although some researchers focus on context history, the attributes of a service have been ignored. In this paper, we have presented an attribute-based scheme for recommending services for consumers. For this end, we grouped all of the given services into several clusters, employed a cluster association model and an ant colony navigation model to track the consumers behaviors, and then calculate the degree of the influences from the attributes of services in relation to the recommendation After these, a service recommendation list is generated for consumers. The proposed models were implemented and the experimental results have shown that the varieties of the attributes do have affects on ranking lists. By refining the system, the proposed scheme could be further analyzed and potentially get its own place in practice REFERENCES 1] Smith, A.D.: Exploring m-commerce in terms of viability, growth and challenges.

The cost of CPU time compared as Fig.2 of these two algorithms 213 124 89 73 57 53 52 65 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 4 5 6 7 Minimum Support Count T i m e  s e c o n d s  PHP Improved Fig.2 the compare CPU time cost of PHP and improved PHP From Fig.2, as support count decreasing, the CPU running 


time of these two algorithms gets increasing, but the PHP is much speeder than the other, especially when count in 6. so wen know the more frequent itemsets and their items, the more efficient of the algorithm V. THE APPLICATION After we got the frequent itemset by the improved PHP algorithm, we can generate the strong associate rule that satisfied minimum support and minimum confidence. The confidence can be computed by Confidence\(A ? B A | B A  B support_count\(A Support_count\(A  B support_count\(A And then we can use confidence threshold strengthen the association, we use improved PHP algorithm dig X company 2002 year sale data, minimum support is 5, 3-itemset, they are 83,549,915}, {485,558,1290}, {454,1097,1546 83,549,982}, {631,980,1490}, {454,1103,1546 810,1026,1469}, {360,830,1036}, and their none null subset as for frequent 3-item {83,549,915}, we can get 83 ? 549? 915,      confidence = 5/9 = 56 83 ? 915? 549,      confidence = 5/5 = 100 915 ? 549? 83,      confidence = 5/5 = 100 83? 915 ? 549,      confidence = 5/50 = 10 549? 83 ? 915,      confidence = 5/78 = 6 915? 83 ? 549,      confidence = 5/73= 7 If the minimum confidence threshold is 80%, only if 83 ? 915 ? 549and 915 ? 549 ? 83 can generate strong associate rules, after these rules, we can not only arrange the shelf of related goods in pairs or groups, but also combine those goods that have most consumers, promote the consumer the pretermission goods. For example, the stronger associate rule 83 ? 915? 549, from the database field product, we know product_id corresponding product_name, this stronger rule is pillow ? pillow clothe ? bedsheet , if there is someone bought pillow and pillow clothe, then promote good bedsheet is an efficient way of sale VI. CONCLUSION We put Hash candidates k-itemset into affair of Dk, that is itemset include in affair, so CPU running time decreased improved PHP algorithm is more efficiency, we can use this improved PHP algorithm in commercial database digging and

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the 


root label in the hierarchies of the ART networks.

Here, GT extracted a much worse hierarchy as shown by CTED being 0.15 higher for GT than for Voting For BoosTexter both HE methods built the same hierarchy and no label was wrongly assigned to the root. All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
