Abstract 003 003 The aim of social network analysis is to search for implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information. And community discovery is an important method to obtain these information. Label propagation algorithm can provide an efficient way to 
discover communities in a large-scale network .In each iteration, the label for each vertex is replaced with the most frequent label from its labels. However this method will lead to many fragmentary communities. To modify this algorithm, we first select some influential nodes as seeds. And then a node will choose its label based on the summation of influences of its neighbors. Our experiment show that the communities discovered by the optimized algorithm is improved

I INTRODUCTION A social network is the network of relationships and interactions among social entities such as individuals, groups of individuals and organizations[1 o t iss u e w h ich h as  been discussed by many scholars, community detection in a network is the gathering of 
network vertices into groups in such a way that nodes in each groups are densely connected inside and sparser outside. Generally speaking when the algorithm operates on the network, the network will be split into k communities and also the number of edges between different communities is minimized. In most cases, the communities acquired by community detection algorithm satisfy the following constraints

community are with a high density of internal links, whereas links between compartments have a comparatively lower density  Tibély and Kertész[5  h a ve ident i f i e d  th e  label propagation algorithm as formally equivalent to minimizing the Hamiltonian for a kinetic Potts model. Baber and Clark[6  p r esen t  label propagation algorithm with the objective function and also introduced two optimized algorithms to maximize the modularity and the bipartite modularity Briefly, the outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce label propagation algorithm\(LPA\ and provide the improvement method fo r label propagation algorithm. And then we will evaluate performance of the algorithm in Section 3.At last we give a conclusion in the last part of this paper II OPTIMIZATION OF LABEL PROPAGATION ALGORITHM When compared with other community discovering algorithms, LPA is a linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks. The basic idea of the algorithm is to change the label of node according  to the number of its neighbors labels and to choose the most labels  that  neighbors have as the new label. Firstly, every node in the network are all initialized with a unique label And then, in each iteration, every node will select the label occurring with the highest frequency among its neighbors. Ref vi d e s  a n  equivalent mathematical to represent the label updating process of LPA. It is as follows where  is the current label for vertex u is the new label for vertex The adjacency matrix are all elements of {0,1}. And by construction, as the algorithm converges, nodes in a community all have same labels, which indicates that each node has more neighbors in its own community than in any of other community This algorithm is easily understood and quickly implemented. During each iteration, it has a computational complexity ,which is linear in the number of edges in the graph  By the way, the iterative process can be synchronous or asynchronous. If we update the labels synchronously, it will lead to oscillation of labels. Therefore, in Ref  th e auth o r d e ci de s  t o  update the labels asynchronously. It means the label of a node will be decided not only by neighbors that have already been updated in the current iteration, but also decided by the neighbors that are not yet changed temporarily  However, this algorithm has some drawbacks that cannot be ignored. For example it returns different solutions \(some of them of poor quality\ in different realizations  T h e  reason for this phenomenon is that every node in the network is initialized with a unique label Though the labels are updated dynamically and asynchronously, it still leads to some isolated nodes or meaningless communities, which sometimes result in the incorrect division of the whole network To evaluate the community structure in networks, Newman and Girvan introduced  the modularity measure\(Q value  it m a kes a comparison between the observed density of edges within communities and the expected density of edges within the same communities in randomized networks. The value closer to 1 indicates stronger community structure. And it has been adopted as an efficient approach to measure the goodness of community division and is expressed as where represents the fraction of edges that connect to vertices in community, and is applied to the observed fraction of edges within community i

is defined as the influence of an active node u exerted on one of its inactive node v[12  To calculate this parameter, the concept of neighbor graph of a node is adopted. And the definition of neighbor graph is as follows

One way to modify this standard algorithm is that we initialize the feed set which contains the most influential nodes with labels in the network instead of labeling all nodes with a unique label before the iterations. It will reduce the range of possible solutions that the algorithm produce. And then instead of considering the labels occurring with the highest frequency among neighbors, we take the node influence into account during the process of label updating The selection of influential nodes in a network has been studied by several researchers In this place, we use the method introduced in Ref[8 I t c o n s i d e r s th e p r o b lem of in f lu entia l  nodes selection based on the propagation speed in social network information diffusion Then, we use

III A NALYSIS OF THE OPTIMIZED ALGORITHM To evaluate the performance of optimized algorithm, we will apply it to different networks from several aspects and then make a comparison between communities acquired by LPA and optimized algorithm  Fig. 2. A computer-generated network Our first applications are based on Zachary s karate club network[9 an d  American college football network[10 b oth  real-world networks. And also we will examine the performance by using a computer generated network. Zachary s karate club network with 34 nodes and 78 edges is divided into two fractions due to leadership issues And for the American College football network, vertices in the graph represent teams and edges stand for regular-season games between the two teams they connect. This network with 115 nodes and 616 edges is split into 12 teams. We have generated a large number of graphs with n=136 vertices artificially divided into two communities. In Figure we can find that each community has a center point  T ABLE s karate club network , the networks are always divided into 3 groups However, only two groups can we get when the optimized algorithm is operated on the network just as what it is in the real world On the other hand, in College Football network, these teams are divided into 12 conferences and each team plays more games within its own conference than inter conference in the real world But the standard LPA always split this network into 10 groups. And the result for the improved one is 11 teams, which are more closed to the actual condition However, in the computer-generated network, the optimized algorithm perform poorly The main reason for this phenomenon is that our improved algorithm is based on the summation of nodes influences. As we can see, in Figure the center point in the larger community is surrounded by most of nodes in the network. And this also leads to the larger influence of this center node. Hence, when the process of community discovery begins, due to the greater influence of the larger community, the center point in the smaller community will be attracted to the larger community. Therefore, the standard algorithm can divide the network into two groups correctly and the optimized algorithm cannot get our desirable results   Though the performance of the optimized algorithm on the computer-generated is not so good, this results still illustrate that the optimized algorithm can present a stronger community when compared with the standard one Another example, we use statistics collected 
QV ALUES FOR THE IMPROVED AND STANDARD ALGORITHM IN DIFFERENT NETWORKS Values in table above are calculated by running the original and optimized algorithm both 20 times on the three networks. As we can see, in the first two networks, when compared with Q values acquired by using standard Label Propagation Algorithm, the average Q values obtained through the optimized LPA  increase by approximately 1.66% and 2.66% respectively Then if we analyze the result from the number of groups, when we apply the standard LPA to Zachary

T HE NUMBER OF GROUPS AND AVERAGE GROUP SIZE OBTAINED  Fig. 3 The relationships between the number of groups and group size From the figure above, we can find that label propagation algorithm divides the network into more than 26 groups. And 21 isolated nodes which do not belong to an y groups exist in the final division. However, the result acquired through the optimized algorithm are split into 7 groups and no isolated points can be found. On the other hand, the Q values we get through the two algorithms are as follows T ABLE Q VALUE FOR THE R EN R EN NETWORK IV C ONCLUSION In this paper, we examined the performance of Label Propagation Algorithm on different real world networks. And also we introduce a method to modify this standard algorithm to optimize the Q value. In the comparison we make between the two algorithms, we find that the improved algorithm provide an useful way to improve the modularity Q. And also, the groups divided by the optimized algorithm are also stronger than the original ones  However, the modified algorithm still have some poor performances just as what we present in Section 10.1109/NSW.2011.6004645 8  F e ng Z o u, W e il i W u.

from RenRen, a social network site like Facebook in China. And these dates are based on a users real friendship network with 11062 edges and 420 nodes which stands for a person in the real word. It has been shown that communities in this network are made up by their similar interests. Or if they were schoolmates at one time, they are more likely to be included by a same community To further evaluate the two algorithms, we still study it from the number of groups, group sizes and Q values T ABLE  When we applied the optimized algorithm to the computer-generated network, a network divided into two groups each with a center point, the network cannot be split correctly Therefore, it is worthy to be analyzed further R EFERENCES 1  M a sa hi r o K i m u r a K a zu m i S a i t o R y oh ei Na k a n o  Extracting Influential Nodes for Information Diffusion on a Social Network Proceedings:22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the 19th Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference ,pp. 1371-1376,2007 2  A a r o n C l au s e t  M E  J New m a n Ch r i st oph er M oor e  Finding community structure in very large networks Physical Review E70, 06111 \(2004\ .8-12 3  W u B  A  H u b e rman F i n d i n g  co mmu n i tie s in l i n e a r time:a physics approach.

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
