Effective Mining of Fuzzy Quantitative Weighted Association Rules LI Cheng-jun and YANG Tian-qi Department of Computer University of Jinan Guangzhou Guangdong Province, China chjlee09@gmail.com Abstract This paper presents a new method of mining weighted association rules ,which can hold the ìweighted downward closed propertyî by using an improved model of weighted support measurements in the weighted setting.Compared to some 
generalized weighted association rules mining, it proves that the method can quickly and efficiently mine important association rules  Keyword weighted association rules; weighted support quantitative itemsets I  I NTRODUCTION  Data mining and knowledge discovery in databases is an interesting research area only developed in the last sixteen years. Association rules mining\(ARM\ms to explore large 
transaction databases for association rules\(AR\which may reveal the implicit relationships among the data attributes. It can be divided into boolean AR and quantitative AR. Agrawal first proposed boolean AR in 1993, and then proposed the classic Apriori and Apriori TID algorithm R M[2] is a popular data mining technique because of its wide application in marketing and retail communities as well as other more diverse fields[3 11   The classical model of ARM employs the support measure which treats every transaction equally. In contrast, different 
transactions have different weights in real-life data sets. For example, in the market basket data, each transaction is recorded with some profit. Much effort has been dedicated to ARM with preassigned weights The paper is organized as follows.In section II we presents background and related work;Section III gives problem definition for improved weighted ARM with fuzzy data and details weighted downward closure property;and section IV ,the detail of the IFWARM algorithms;section V reviews experimental evaluation with a real customer data and section 
VI concludes the paper 000\003 001\012\000\021\000\003 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK In literature on ARM,weights of items are mostly treated as equally important.Recently some approaches give items weights to reflect their significance to the user, The weights may be attributed to occasional promotions of such items or their profitability e s a w e igh t ed boolean attribu t es  of the concept of AR, and gives two weighted ARM algorithms: MINWAL \(O\d MINWAL \(W Fuzzy ARM is especially useful to consider the quantities 
involved in the userís request. Such merit presents more detail and a more reliable exploration of the association rules than a generic association rule n t r odu ces t h e probl e m of  m i n i ng weighted quantitative AR based on fuzzy approach.[7  develops a systematic approach to the assessment of fuzzy AR os es a n o v e l al g o ri t h m t o av oi d t h e l o s s  of semantic information due to the partition of quantitative values.

occurring item.it is much important to find a good method for calculating itemsí support value.In the last step,it calculates a confidence value with the all subsets of discovered frequently itemset according to a formula In this paper we present an approach to mine weighted quantitative data by fuzzy means to address the issue of invalidation of WDCP. We then show that rules can be generated efficiently by using the proposed technique 000\003

Improved Fuzzy Weighted Association Rule Mining A fuzzy dataset D consists of fuzzy transactions T      2 1 n t t t with fuzzy sets associated with each item in I        2 1 I i i i which is identified by a set of linguistic labels L        2 1 L l l l for example L  Small  Medium  Large We assign a weight w to each l in L   Associated with i Each attribute   j i i t is associated with several fuzzy sets The degree of of association is given by a membership degree in the range w h ich i n dicates  t h e correspondence between the value of a given   j i i t and the set of fuzzy linguistic labels. The th k weighted fuzzy set for the th j item in the th i fuzzy transaction is given by     w l i t k j i Thus each label k l for item j i would have associated with it a weight, i.e. a pair w l i    a weighted item where L l i 002     is a label associated with i and W w 002 is weight associated with label l  We illustrate the fuzzy weighted ARM concept and definitions using tables I and II, Table I contains transactions for 2 quanitiative items discretised into two overlapped intervals with fuzzy vales.

Now we argue that the WDCP with quantitative data can be validated using the proposed approach  We also brefly prove that the WDCP is always valid in the proposed method.The following lemma applies to both Boolean and quantative data and is stated as Lemma If an itemset is not frequent then its superset can not be frequent and FS subset 007 FS superset\e

Rule 1 3 and 2 3 wonêt pass the importance test and thus, the DFMLA algorithm wonêt test rules 1.1 3.1, 1.1 3.2, 2.1 3.1 etc contrary to the other algorithm which will eventually test the rules when it gets to the respective level    Fig.3.Multi-level Apriori vs. DFMLA. Performance comparison  An important disadvantage that DFMLA algorithm has is its memory usage. In a database with many concept levels when we get to the last level, TIDs for each previous level will be retained The studies were made on a multi-level database, created as presented at section 4. The database had 45000 database entries, 7500 transactions, each one having no more than 15 items; 750 distinct items which were encoded on 10 concept levels The experiments were conducted at a Pentium-IV machine with 512 MB memory at 2.8 GHz, running Red Hat Linux 7.3. The program was implemented in Java  VI  CONCLUSIONS  The scope of data-mining has been broadened by the study on the mining on multiple-level rules. The mining of multiple level rules can provide more information for the users and enhance the flexibility and power of data-mining systems This algorithm finds new rules by using the knowledge gained from previously found rules. If a rule fails at the first concept level many rules from the following concept levels wonêt be studied and thus,  the more concept levels a database has, the faster it will be to get results compared to other algorithms Storing the database in the primary memory is no longer a problem. On the other hand, storing the candidates causes trouble in situations, where a dense database is considered with a small support threshold. This is the case for any algorithm using candidates. Therefore, it would be desirable to look for a method which stores candidates in secondary memory. This is an obvious topic for future research Our conclusion is that DFMLA is a simple practical, straight forward and fast algorithm for finding all frequent itemsets  REFERENCES  1 Ag ra w a l  R   I m i e l i n s k i  T  a n d  S w a m i A    M i n in g  association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proc. of the ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data pages 207Ö216, 1993 2 A g r a wa l  R   an d S t r i k a n t R    F as t a l g o r i t h m s  f o r m i n i n g  association rules In Proc. 1994 Int.

Figure 3 Precision-recall curve in ROI-250 image dataset 5.3 Experiment 3 Mammograms-1080 image dataset This experiment employed a dataset composed by 1080 mammograms images collected in the Clinical Hospital of University of Sao Paulo at Ribeiro Preto The dataset was previously classi\002ed into 4 levels of breast tissue density 0501\051 mostly fatty 050362 images\051 0502\051 partly fatty 050446 images\051 0503\051 partly dense 050200 images\051 and 0504\051 mostly dense 05072 images\051 Figure 4 Precision-recall curve in Mammography-1080 image dataset Breast density is an important risk factor in the development of breast cancer In this experiment the images are represented by the feature set proposed in b uilding a vector of 85 features including shape and size of the breast the conditions of the breast contour nipple position and the distribution of 002broglandular tissue This dataset was divided in training set and test set The training set is composed of 720 images and test set is composed of 360 images Figure 4 shows the P&R curves over test dataset and also the number of features selected in each method Again the proposed methods reached the highest values of precision and select the smallest number of features 050a\051 050b\051 050c\051 050d\051 Figure 5 Queries in Mammography dataset 050a\051 226 is the query image 050b\051 using the features selected through 002tness function F cB  050c\051 using the features selected through classi\002cation error of C4.5 and 050d\051 using the all features extracted Results for the retrieval of the 5 most similar images from a query image are also provided in this experiment as illustrated in Figure 5 The image 5.\050a\051 is the query image taken from the mostly fatty image class Images shown in 5.\050b\051 are the 5 most similar images retrieved for the proposed 002tness function F cB  The row 050c\051 shows the results for C 4  5 classi\002er whereas 050d\051 illustrate the images resulting from all features 050no selection applied\051 In Figure 5 the images surrounded by dashed lines are false positives 050not relevant images\051 For this query the proposed method achieved the highest precision 050100%\051 when compared the results of C4.5 and the original feature vector 050precision of 40%\051 


6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
