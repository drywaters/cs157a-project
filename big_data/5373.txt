Financial Asset Price Forecasting Based on Intertransaction Association Rules Mining  Ping Li, Wenjing Xing School of Economics and Management Beihang University Beijing, China liping124@buaa.edu.cn Huang Guangdong School of Inform ation Engineering China Geosciences University \(Beijing Beijing, China gdhuang@cugb.edu.cn   Abstract It has been widely accep ted that association rules mining, the task of searching for correlations between items in a database, can discover useful rule s in stock analysis. Previous studies mainly emphasize on mining intratransaction associations 
In this paper, we introduce th e concept of intertransaction and the FITI algorithm so that we can effectively forecast the price changes in Chinese capi tal markets, then we compare FITI with EH-Apriori, and demonstrate the advantages of FITI over EHApriori. At the end of this paper, we apply the algorithm to a dataset of Chinese asset indices and the results indicate the usefulness of intertransaction associ ation rules in price prediction Keywords-Price forcasting, Intertransaction association rules Data mining, EH-Apriori algorithm, FITI algorithm I   I NTRODUCTION  Data mining is widely used in various academic fields such as forecasting stock market or bank bankruptcies 
financial risk management, credit rating, bank customer profiling and cross-selling analysis. One important problem in data mining is mining association rules, which was introduced by Agrawal [1  Give n tw o it em sets X and Y  a n as sociat ion rule means X Y Association rules mining can be used in market analysis fraud detection, medical resear ch and process re-engineering  h e m o st ofte n cited work on m a rket analysis is m i ning interesting rules from supermarkets transaction database. Each transaction contains the items bo ught by one of its customer An example of the rule is ì70% of customers who bought milk 
also bought breadî which can be expressed R1: milk bread support 60 confidence 80 Association rules mining of large databases gives rise to many research directions, in cluding Apriori-like mining methods  ntitative association rules m i ning[4 constraint-based rules mining [5   m i ning association r u les with multiple supports [6 n s t r ain t-b a sed ru le m i n i n g 7   mining sequential patterns and episodes 9  In spite of all these efforts, there is a kind of association relationships of great importance and usefulness that could not be expressed using the traditional association rule mining 
framework---intertransaction association rule mining. This problem was first explored by Anthon troduced the notion of intertransaction a ssociation rule, defined its own measures support and confidence and developed an efficient Apriori-like algorithm---FITI algorithm. This algorithm decomposes intertransaction association rule mining problem into three subproblems. First one finds and stores frequent intratransaction item sets; and then, he/she transforms the database into a set of encoded Frequent-Itemset Tables \(Called FIT tables\ finally, he/she can find frequent intertransaction item sets The difference between the traditional association rule and 
intertransaction association rule can be depicted as the following R2: ëëWhen the prices of TCL and Changhong go up, the price of Hisense will increase on the same day with probability of 80 However, stockjobbers may be more interested in the following rule R3: ëëIf the prices of TCL and Changhong go up on the first day, the price of Hisense will increase two days later probability of 80 Classical association rules, like R2, discover the relationship among items within the same transactions, while R3 expresses association among items of different transactions along certain dimension. Releva nt studies include sequential patterns mining a n d m i ning epis o d es 9  
In this paper, we will investigate the application of intertransaction association rules mining in stock price predication and the possibility of generalizing this method to futures market The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we explain the definitions of intertransaction and describe the intertransaction association rule mining task; in Section 3, we present the framework of intertransaction association rule mining method and express the main idea of FITI algorithm, then briefly review the FITI algorithm and show the advantage of it ov er traditional algorithms. Real datasets are investigated in Section 4, where we discuss the generalization and application of this method to Chinese 
capital market. We summarize our work in Section 5 II  P ROBLEM D ESCRIPTIONS  Definition 1 Let 12     u ee e denote a set of items, where u is the number of transactions, and denote D a set of non-negative integer s called domain attributes. A

transaction database is a set of transactions 12    n TT T  where T i  i= 1, 2,Ö, n subset of A transaction is in the form of d, E where  dDomD and E  d is named a dimensional attribute and E is named an itemset The dimensional attribute describes the properties associated with the data items, such as time and location. We assume that the domain of the di mensional attribute is ordinal and can be divided into equal length intervals. For example time can be divided into hours, days, weeks, etc. The intervals can be represented by integers Definition 2 A sliding window W in a transaction database is a block of w continuous intervals along domain D starting from interval d 0  such that contains a transaction at interval d 0 Each interval d j in W is called a subwindow of W and denoted as W  j  h er e j= d j d 0  We call j the subwindow number of d j  within W  The concept of sliding window is introduced to describe how many intervals an inter transaction association rule spans across. In order to save resources and mine more economically the parameter maxspan  w introduced to express the size of the sliding window Definition 3 A megatransaction M is defined as       1   0 1  ii MejejWj iu jw  1 Items in one megatransaction are defined as extended-items and denote the set of all extended-items as 112 2 0\,,\(-1\,\(0\,,\(-1\,,\(0\,... ,\(-1 uu eewe eweew  2 We define the set of items 1  I as intratransaction itemset and the set of items 2 I as intertransaction itemset Definition 4 An intertransaction association rule is written in the form of XY where  XY  and XY  Definition 5 X and Y are both extended itemsets subject to Definition 4. We define the support and confidence of an intertransaction association rule X Y as    and  Support  TT M X T X M 3     Confidence    TT DandX Y T XY TT DandX T 4 Above definitions can be explained by an example. Table 1 shows a transaction database containing five transactions The five transactions are located at intervals 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Let w 4, we now have five sliding windows W 1   W 2   W 3   W 4 and  W 5 with addresses of 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, respectively. Each window contains 4 subwindows. For example W 1  has four subwindows W 1   with it e m s a, b W 1   with items b d W 1 2 an d  W 1  with ite m s a, b, c, d  Each sliding window forms a megatransaction, which is the itemset of all the items in one sliding window. In our case the megatransaction in W 1    b 0 b  1 d  1     b  3   c 3 d[3 T h us w e have  a 1 0  b 1 0 b 1 1 d 1 1 a 1 3 b 1  c 1  d 1  2 0 d 2  a 2  b 2 2 c 2    d 2 2 b 2 3 2 3 3 0 b 3 0 c 3   d 3 0 3 1 c 3   a 3   b 4 0 c 4 0 a 4 1 a 5 0 Then, after we set the two essential parameters minsup  denotes minimum support level minconf denotes minimum confidence level\ine intertransaction association rules from the trans action database. For instance setting minsup 0.4 and minconf 0.8, we can get one rule mined from Table 1, {b[0  d[0  a[2 support 0.4 confidence 1 TABLE I   T RANSACTION DATABASE  D E  1 a, b  2 b, d  3   4 a, b, c, d W 1  5 b, c W 2   6 a 7  W 3  8  W 4  9  W 5   III  INING INTERTRANSACTION ASSOCIATION RULES  In this section, we give an overview of intertransaction association rules mining. Like the traditional association rule mining, the novel one consists of two steps 1\d frequent intertransaction itemsets whose support is higher than minsup 2\or every frequent intertransaction itemset L, output an intertransaction association rule  SLS if the following conditions are satisfied i  1  i ej S i u  ii  1  0 i ej L S i u j   iii.

The result shows that although FITI requires larger computer memory space than EH-Apriori it outperforms the traditional algorithm, since FITI could save considerable running time IV  PPLICATIONS IN C HINESE R EAL F INANCIAL D ATA  In this section, we apply the FITI algorithm to various financial datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of intertransaction association rules in price prediction. All the data   obtained from the Wind Database http://www.wind.com.cn A  Dataset of Chinese capital market  We first consider the dataset of Chinese treasury bond T-bond\y price index traded in Shanghai Stock Exchange \(TB\, Shanghai Com posite Index \(CI\ily price daily exchange rate of Euro against RMB \(ER\US dollar against RMB \(UR\ in the inter-bank foreign exchange market from January 23 2007 to June 23, 2007 We use these data for several reasons. First, the capital market comprises of foreign exchange market, stock market bonds and loan market. Most existing studies investigate the relation between stock market and bond market. Here we apply our method to the capital market and try to find intertransaction association rules from them We separate the dataset into two portions: one is UP and the other is DOWN. The UP consists of the stock indices, bond indices and exchange rates that rise on the experiment day, and the latter group contains their decrease counterparts We set maxspan 5 so that we could detect the association rules happening with in five days. The results are quite interesting. One rule of the UP part is ìER \(1\ TB 2 CI \(4 support 0.19 and confidence 0.86. This means that if Euro against RMB rises on the first day followed by the increase of Ch inese Treasury bond on the second day, then the possibility that Shanghai Composite Index rises on the fourth day is 86%. For the Down part, a rule is ìCI \(1\, ER \(3 TB \(5 support 0.10 and confidence 0.81, which indicates that if Shanghai Composite Index decreases on the first day and the exchange rate of Euro against RMB decreases on the third day , the possibility that the Chinese treasury bond index decreases is 81%. With these rules, one speculator can buy the stock index when the events in the first rule happen, and sell the bond when the events in the second rule happen From this example we can see the usefulness of intertransaction association rule mining in finding rules and stock price prediction B  Dataset of stock indices The second dataset consists of Shanghai Composite Index \(SCI Hong Kong Hang Seng Index \(HSI Taiwan Weighted Stock Index \(WTI\days from January 1, 2007 to June 29, 2007. Like the above 
1424 


method, the data is first separated into two groups. From the UP group, one interesting rule we find is ìHSI \(1 2 SCI \(5 support 0.26 and confidence 0.81 which means that if the HIS and TWI increase on the first and second day, respectively, the possibility that the SCI increases on the fifth day is 81 This rule among the three indices may reveal a potential effect of the stock markets of Hong Kong and Taiwan on the stock market of China mainland. Such unaware relationship can be discovered using the intertransaction mining method introduced C  Dataset of futures market The third dataset considers SHFE and LME copper \(Cu futures, NYMEX crude oil \(CL\exchange rate of US dollar against RMB and the exchange rate of Euro against US dollar for 334 tradi ng days from July 3, 2006 to June 1, 2007 We use futures market data for several reasons According to Chan et al. [1 h ou 12 and Andersen et al there m a y be certain relations am ong the LME Cu, SHFE Cu, NYMEX CL and foreign exchange rate. The mining result shows th at there is a certain relation among SHFE Cu, LEM Cu, and NYMEX HL. Let maxspan 4, one of the rules is ìSHFE Cu \(1\LEM Cu \(3 NYMEX HL \(3 support 0.11 and confidence 0.79. But we can't find any relation among them and foreign exchange rate V  ONCLUSIONS AND P OSSIBLE F UTURE W ORK  There is no doubt that traditional association rule mining is a useful method for price prediction. However the classical method is limited within individual transaction In this paper, we demonstrate that the mysterious association rules among different transactions could be mined by the intertransaction association rule mining and FITI algorithm, and apply the intertransaction association rule mining method into Chinese financial market trend prediction. From our dataset analysis, we find the effectiveness of intertransacti on association rule mining in mining rules among different economic indicators In the future, we will extend our study further to mine more advisable and interesting rules that could explain Chinese financial market better A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(No. 70971006, 70831001, 70501003 Aeronautic Science Foundation \(No. 2006ZG51079  R EFERENCES  1  R.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
