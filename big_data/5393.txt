Abstract 
With the development of the Internet and Web technology and frequent cross-cultural communication, it is necessary for people to be able to access and manage information in many different languages. The scheduling of multilingual information resources become complex, as 
multilingual information resources stored in different cloud datacenters are heterogeneous and their distributions are uneven. In this paper, based on Min-Min algorithm, Least Languages First Min-Min \(LLFMM\ scheduling algorithm that is suitable to multilingual information resources and can improve information resources scheduling performance in cloud computing is proposed. A task with least number of sites that can fulfill this task is firstly selected in LLFMM, rather than the task with the least execution time among all the tasks in Min-Min. Petri net is a powerful graphical and mathematics tool for describing the concurrent, asynchronous and dynamic events. This paper models and analyzes the multilingual information resources scheduling using colored dynamic timed 
Petri nets \(CDTdPN\ CDTdPN model, the color represents different language information resource, and the time of a transition representing scheduling time is a function of tokens in input places of the transition. The concurrent scheduling marking graph \(CSMG\ of CDTdPN is defined and the algorithm for constructing the CSMG of CDTdPN is given in this paper. The CSMG can represent the concurrent relation of transitions in Petri nets and reduce the size of the graph to be constructed in some extent. Finally, the example and simulation show that our scheduling algorithm is effective in reducing makespan and our modeling and analyzing techniques are convenient for analyzing performance of scheduling system 
 I NTRODUCTION  Cloud computing 1 provides information resources for users in "Cloud" through the Internet. Cloud computing utilizes large-scale virtualized data centers to manage such large volume of resources. Scheduling is considered to be an important issue in Cloud computing. Typically, it is difficult to find an optimal resource allocation which minimizes the makespan and effectively utilize the resources. The choice of

the best pair of jobs and resources has been proved to be NPcomplete problem. Large numbers of heuristic resources scheduling algorithms are available to minimize the makespan. The simple well-known algorithm used for tasks scheduling in heterogeneous computing systems is Min-Min   The Min-Min heuristic algorithm is becoming the benchmark of such kinds of task/host scheduling problems The numbers of languages for information stored in different datacenters are uneven. Some languages such as English and Spanish could be distributed in many datacenters, while some languages such as Korean and Japanese may be stored in a few datacenters. So, it is not 
suitable to the multilingual resources scheduling for existing mono-lingual resource algorithms. In this paper, we propose a different algorithm to the original Min-Min algorithm in order to adapt to the characteristics of multilingual information requirements. The algorithm proposed in this paper called Least Languages First Min-Min \(LLFMM considers the characteristics of uneven distribution of multilingual information resources in cloud datacenters. A task with least number of sites that can fulfill this task is firstly selected in LLFMM, rather than the task with the least execution time among all the tasks in Min-Min As the complexity of multilingual information resources scheduling in cloud computing, there is a need for modeling and analyzing techniques for scheduling flow of multilingual 
information resources. Petri nets are perfect mathematical and graphic tools for modeling and analysis resources scheduling. So it has received increasing application in modeling and analyzing resource scheduling. But, the model and analysis technology are not suitable to the multilingual information resources scheduling in cloud computing. We use colored dynamic timed Petri net \(CDTdPN\o model and analyze multilingual information resources scheduling in cloud computing. In CDTdPN model, the color represents different language information resource, and the time of a transition representing scheduling time is a function of tokens in input places of the transition. In this paper, we define the concurrent scheduling marking graph \(CSMG\ of 
CDTdPN and give the algorithm for constructing the CSMG of CDTdPN. The CSMG can reduce the size of the graph to be constructed in some extent The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related works. In section 3, we give a scheduling algorithm LLFMM for multilingual information resources in cloud computing. Aiming at the problems of analysis and modeling of the multilingual information resources scheduling in cloud computing, colored dynamic timed Petri

The conclusions of the paper are given in section 6 II R ELATED W ORK  Min-Min algorithm starts with a set of all unmapped tasks. The machine that has the minimum completion time for all jobs is selected. Then the job with the overall minimum completion time is selected and mapped to that resource. The ready time of the resource is updated. This process is repeated until all the unmapped tasks are assigned The Min-min heuristics is now becoming the benchmark of such kinds of task/host scheduling problems. However, the Min-min algorithm is unable to balance the load well since it usually maps small tasks first and did not deal with the Quality of Service \(QoS Some improved algorithms for the resources scheduling in cloud computing have been proposed in the literature. All the problems discussed in those methods are taken and analyzed to give a more effective schedule.

So it is not suitable to the multilingual resources scheduling for existing resource algorithms in cloud computing. An extension of Min-min algorithm called Least Languages First Min-Min is proposed in this paper As the complexity of cloud computing system, there is a need for modeling and analyzing techniques for multilingual information resources scheduling. Petri nets are perfect mathematical and graphic tools for modeling and analysis scheduling problems. W.M.P. van der Aalst modeled and analyzed scheduling problems using timed Petri nets in [1 Some Petri nets models for the resources scheduling in grid computing have been proposed in the literature.

In our previous work [14-1 w e pr opo sed s o m e  Petri net models for resources scheduling in grid computing transaction scheduling in grid database and multilingual information parallel downloads in data grid. But, above model and analysis technologies are not suitable to the multilingual information resources scheduling in cloud computing environment. Therefore, new models and performance analysis technologies for the multilingual information resources scheduling in cloud computing are proposed in this paper. We use colored dynamic timed Petri net \(CDTdPN\ to model and analyze multilingual information resources scheduling in cloud computing. In CDTdPN, the time interval of a transition is a function of tokens in input places of the transition, which is convenient for modeling and analyzing dynamic performance of multilingual information resources in cloud computing Reachable marking graph\(RMG\[18 is  a v e ry im portan t  tool to analyze the dynamic properties of Petri nets, but the major weakness of the RMG is that the size of RMG grows with the number of processes and thus creates the state space explosion problem. Moreover, the concurrent relation of transitions in Petri nets cannot be represented by RMG. In this paper, we use the concurrent scheduling marking graph instead of RMG to analyze the correctness and effectiveness of the system III S CHEDULING A LGORITHM FOR M ULTILINGUAL I NFORMATION R ESOURCES IN C LOUD C OMPUTING  In this section, we give a scheduling algorithm LLFMM of multilingual information resources for scheduling agent The algorithm LLFMM starts by sorting the requirements i.e. tasks\. It first identifies the number of datacenters storing each requirement and sorts the requirements in ascending order of the number of datacenters storing multilingual requirements. Thus the requirement with minimum number of datacenters that can fulfill the requirement is scheduled first. The main aim of the scheduling algorithm is to minimize the makespan The scheduling problem can be defined as follows Let multilingual requirement set  be the group of multilingual requirements submitted to scheduler Let multilingual information set  be the group of multilingual information resources provided by cloud datacenters, where  Let datacenter set DC e the set of cloud datacenters, where  Let is a matrix, where is the estimated scheduling time of requirement on datacenter If the requirement do not exist in datacenter     Let is a matrix, where is the expected transmit time taken by transmitting requirement to datacenter from global scheduling agent

To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we design a program to execute the Min-Min and LLFMM algorithms. Suppose that there are 20 datacenters in cloud computing system and the total languages are 10. The number of languages stored in each datacenter and the download times of requirements on datacenters are produced randomly by the program. The experimental evaluation of the algorithms is performed for n={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10 languages included in requirement. We run the program 100 times and get the average makespan for each requirement Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the comparison of makespans Suppose the interval of download times for each requirement is 10-50s From table 2 and Fig. 3, we can observe that LLFMM algorithm produces same makespan as Min-Min when the number of language included in requirement is equal to 1 LLFMM algorithm produces less makespan than the MinMin algorithm when the number of language included in requirement is greater than 1. The greater number of language included in requirement, the bigger difference of makespans between two algorithms TABLE II C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we propose a new algorithm LLFMM for multilingual information resources scheduling. It uses the advantages of Min-Min algorithm and overcomes its disadvantages by choosing the requirement with the least number of sites that can fulfill this requirement rather than one with the least execution time. The example and simulation show that the proposed scheduling model and algorithm can reduce the makespan and increase the resource utilization. So, it is an effective algorithm for the scheduling of multilingual information resources in cloud computing We also construct a colored dynamic timed Petri net CDTdPN\ model for multilingual information resource scheduling in cloud computing and give a definition of the concurrent scheduling marking graph \(CSMG\ of CDTdPN We give two propositions for analyzing performances such as correctness and makespan of multilingual information resource scheduling in cloud computing using CSMG of CDTdPN  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is support partially by projects of The Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning Project in Shanghai 2010BTQ001  Major Scientific Projects of Shanghai International Studies University and high-level cultivation program of CIB, Shanghai International Studies University  R EFERENCES  1

Fig 6 Number of Disk Accesses and number of similarity calculation on query execution on database fragments of different sizes a distance radius equal to 50 of a given image takes around 1,200 seconds using the Slim-tree for the respective fragment and 18,577 seconds using the Slim-tree for the entire database On the other hand the query to retrieve images annotated with the tag value chamberlains just 2 images and within the same distance radius of 50 from a given image takes less than 1 second using the respective fragment and 12,514 seconds using the Slim-tree index for the entire database Finally Figure 7 presents the results of a conjunctive complex query with the equality predicate tag  puppy and a kN N q predicate with the center in the image presented in the top left corner highlighted by the red square These 4 images are ranked in the results from left to right and from top to bottom The execution of this query using the fragment referring to the tag puppy  which contains the descriptions of 105,570 images took 108 seconds using a B-tree to 002nd the fragment and a Slim-tree to process the similarity-based predicate in the contents of this fragment As the kN N predicate is not commutative with other predicates for data 002ltering we sho w in Figure 8 the results of a query by a Range q predicate with radius 50 and center in the image on the top left corner These results were produced by using a Slim-tree that indexes the entire database This query took 13,176 seconds to execute Filtering these results for the tag value puppy to produce the result showed in Figure 7 would require further processing but the time to solve the Range q predicate on the Slim-tree that indexes the entire database contents is dominant VI C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK This paper introduces an approach for ef\002ciently processing queries on big complex databases by using horizontal fragments of the database and multi-level indexing This approach has three steps i 002nd fragments with data satisfying some query predicate\(s ii 002lter the data in the chosen fragment\(s according to other predicate\(s conjunctively connected to the former iii compose the results obtained from each fragment The experimental results demonstrate that this proposal drastically improve query execution speed They show that it is not viable to run the similarity-based predicates over the Fig 7 Results of a conjunctive query executed by using the fragment that describes only images tagged with puppy Fig 8 Results of a Range q predicate on the entire database that took almost 100 times longer to produce than those in Figure 7 entire CoPhIR database that describes around 106 million images even using the Slim-tree metric index to speedup the execution of similarity-based predicates on image content descriptors In fact even big fragments describing more than a 100 thousand images approximately need to be further fragmented to ensure acceptable response time Though the case study presented in this paper only considers conjunctive queries with an equality predicate and a similarity-based predicate the proposed approach can be employed for ef\002cient execution of queries with arbitrary numbers of predicates of various kinds and logically connected in different ways In fact our approach opens new research paths towards ef\002cient query execution on big complex data Among the challenges involved in the full exploitation of the proposed approach we mention the following ones for future work i develop automatic techniques to create appropriate horizontal fragments of large databases for ef\002cient query execution ii index fragment collections to ef\002ciently 002nd fragments suitable to solve different kinds of predicates iii devise and validate queries optimization techniques that exploit appropriate database fragments and access methods VII A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Thanks to CNPq CAPES FEESC and FAPESP for their 002nancial support

 From Figure 8 we can see that, when data size increases the performance of CSA-DSD decreases rapidly while the performance of IOT-StatisticDB is relatively stable. The main reason is that in CS A-DSD, large volumes of statistical raw data needs to be transferred to and stored at the master server for statistical analysis. Therefore, the query response time is prop ortional to the whole data size On the other hand, in IOT-StatisticDB, the main workload is distributed among the nod e servers, so that the overall performance is less sensitiv e to the overall data size To better analysis how the statistical analysis workload is shared by multiple node servers in IOT-StatisticDB, we define the speedup rate 60 100 140 180 220 2.85 3.05 3.71 3.81 3.73 19.25 21 22.36 22.5 21.85 We can observe from Table 3 that when the number of node servers is 4, the speedup rate is between 2.85~3.81 and when the number of node servers is increased to 32, the speedup rate is between 19.25~22.36. In general, with the number of node servers incr easing, the query response time decreases, since in IOT-StatisticDB, the query response time is main decided by the da ta size of each node server V C ONCLUSIONS  Statistical analysis on sensor sampling data is one of the most important procedures in IoT systems to transform dataŽ into knowledgeŽ. In this paper, we propose a

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even goodŽ partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity … the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the clouds elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPs synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and …in at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an oracleŽ approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workers time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling. The total time estimates for running BC on WG and CP graphs, normalized to  
 plot shows speedup of 8 workers relative to 4 workers, for each superstep, when running BC on WG and CP graphs plot shows the number of vertices active in that superstep Estimated time for BC using elastic scaling, normalized to time taken for 4 workers. Normalized cost is shown on secondary Y axis WG graph shown on left CP graph shown on right. Smaller is better

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
