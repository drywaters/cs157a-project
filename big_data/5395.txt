work Programming is a newly developed evolutionary algorithm with directed graph gene structures which has been applied to data mining for intrusion detection systems and has shown that it provides good performances in intrusion detection In this paper a hybrid rule mining algorithm based on Fuzzy GNP and probabilistic classiìcation has been proposed Hybrid rule mining uses fuzzy class association rule mining algorithm to extract rules with different classes Then using different class rules and the classiìcation of data is done probabilistically The hybrid methods showed excellent results by the simulation experiments Keywords Intrusion detection Genetic Network Programming Hybrid rule Fuzzy GNP Probabilistic classiìcation Fuzzy class association rule I I NTRODUCTION 
Nowadays as computer and communication technologies develope damages caused by an intrusion and crimes related to computer systems have been increasing Therefore the network security which can ensure the system to behave as intended and to provide stable services becomes an important matter An intrusion detection system emerged to detect several types of malicious behaviors that compromise the security and trust of a computer system Intrusion detection can extract information from a computer or a network of computers and attempt to detect the presence of intrusion from external sources as well as the system abuse by authorized users Generally intrusion detection is to separate the abnormal data from the normal data Therefore the problem of intrusion detection can be composed of two parts The rst part is how 
to extract useful information from the history database then how to organize such useful information to make accurate classiìcation The conventional main intrusion detection techniques are misuse detection and anomaly detection Traditional misuse detection approach detects intrusions based on the patterns of known attacks which has high detection accuracy for the attacks having similar features to known ones But it fails to recognize a brand new attack usually Whereas anomaly detection detects new attacks by modeling the normal activities of the network trafìc and determining whether the deviation from the established normal patterns can be regarded as intrusions However the patters of normal activities may contain intrusion traces and also the activities of legitimate users may deviate 
from patters of the normal activity All the two aspects may lead to high false alarm  Genetic Network Programming\(GNP which is a kind of evolutionary algorithms has been proposed in recent years and applied to many elds such as trafìcs stocks elevator control and etc It has a unique directed graph structure which is distinguished from the string structure of Genetic Algorithm\(GA and tree structure of Genetic Programming\(GP The nodes in GNP can be reused during evolutionary processes This is just a distinct feature for making GNP mine a lot of important rules from the database  In this paper a hybrid rule mining using GNP combined with probabilistic classiìcation is proposed On the basis of the combination of misuse detection with anomaly detection fuzzy logic theory is introduced into GNP to extract fuzzy 
rules Then the probability density function of the average matching degree of the data with rules can be calculated Based on this new connection data can be classiìed into normal activity known or unknown intrusion This paper is organized as follows In section II basic concept of GNP and traditional class association rule mining are brieîy reviewed Section III describes hybrid rules extraction combining fuzzy logic theory with class association rule mining Then the probabilistic classiìcation is introduced in section V The simulation results using KDD99CUP data is given in Section IV followed by conclusions in Section VII II C LASS A SSOCIATION R ULE

executed The set of J 1  J 2   J m represents judgement nodes which have conditional branch decision functions and return judgement results so as to determine the next node Processing nodes like P 1  P 2   P n serve as action functions to determine PR0001/10/0000-2614 2614

numerical attribute e  g the attribute Age which is generally in the range 0-100, can be divided into six sharp partitions namely 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75, 76 and above. In case of FACISME, fuzzy sets are used instead of sharp partitions, in order to convert numerical attributes to fuzzy partitions. The attribute Age can be divided into three fuzzy partitions, namely Young, Medium-aged, and Old, with each value of age belonging to each of the three fuzzy partitions with some membership value 265 Thus, the number of sharp partitions that need to be used to handle a numerical attribute is far greater than the number of fuzzy partitions required to do the same. Moreover, this leads to better understanding by the user as there are few well-defined fuzzy partitions with linguistic names/meanings like Young and Old, as opposed to sharp partitions which are less intuitive and to which a user cannot relate to immediately For the current analysis we have used two fuzzy partitions for all numerical attributes throughout all the datasets. As described in section 5.C, the time complexity of FACISME is quite high, because of which the time required to train a fuzzy classifier using FACISME is also high. Hence, we have used two fuzzy partitions so as to limit the training time. But, even with just two fuzzy partitions we have achieved quite high accuracies, as described above. More importantly, even with this, we achieved similar \(sometimes better results\s other state-of-the art classifiers used in this experimental analysis. The reason for these high accuracies is that FACISME is based on the theoretically sound and well-established maximum entropy framework  VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed a new classifier based on the paradigms of association rules mining and fuzzy logic  Though recent classifiers i nvolving association rules have shown their techniques to be accurate, their approaches to build a classifier either manifest unobserved statistical relationships in the dataset, or have no statistical basis at all FACISME uses the well-known maximum entropy principle and iterative scaling to build a statistical and robust theoretical model for classification Fuzzy Logic gives FACISME the capability to deal accurately and efficiently  with any type of datasets and domains, and in any kind of environments, which is not necessarily true for traditional crisp classifiers. Thus, using maximum entropy and fuzzy logic, FACISME provides very  good  accuracy and can work with all types of data irrespective of size and type of attributes \226 numerical or binary  REFERENCES 1  Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R.: Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
