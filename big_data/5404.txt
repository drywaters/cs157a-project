261 247 A Minimizing response time in a CDN B DNS I I NTRODUCTION Ef\223cient content delivery over the web has become an important element in improving web performance Against this background content distribution networks CDNs have been proposed to maximize bandwidth improve accessibility and maintain correctness through content replication CDNs enable the distribution of content to cache servers located close to users thus realizing fast reliable applications and web services for the users CDNs are used by internet service providers to deliver static as well as dynamic contents which are replicated on distributed servers 3 When a speci\223c web page 223le or program is requested by a user the closest server is dynamically determined for reducing the load on the main server This distribution method optimizes the throughput of content delivery to the user CDNs provide numerous bene\223ts for cacheable content low delivery cost high quality of experience for end-users and high robustness of delivery Hence they are frequently used for large-scale content delivery In particular the adoption of CDNs helps realize performance improvement from the following viewpoints i overall system throughput that is the average number of requests served in a time unit and ii response time or round trip time RTT for the client measured from the time of sending a request Finding the nearest surrogate server for a particular CDN client is the most important factor in minimizing a clients response time Connection performance largely depends on the request redirection RR management of which domain name system DNS management and URL rewriting are the most popular ones used by the CDN provider CDN provider such as Akamai use DNS-based management to redirect requests from clients to their nearest server In this paper we propose a method in which serviceoriented router SoR functions are implemented in a nextgeneration CDN for effective and ef\223cient RR management SoR is a Router that can interact with and provide services to clients by using a de\223ned application program interface API SoR can observ e traf 223c data streams inspect pack et payloads as well as packet headers and store the designated data in the associated database To store data in a database the SoR uses a new query language named service-oriented switch and router query language SSRQL The proposed SSRQL can provide up to 10 Gbps throughput Application programmers can access the database by using SSRQL queries to develop new services in the SoR such as capturing content in a website and routing redirection for a CDN 9 or for arti\223cial intelligent systems such as Bayesian networks In addition an SoR monitors packet streams and conducts deep packet inspection of payloads as well as headers and re-routes packets based on their payloads 11 II R ESEARCH B ACKGROUND 978-1-4799-2851-4/13/$31.00 \2512013IEEE 1007 A CDN delivers contents to users from those edges of the network that are close to the client A CDN realizes a smaller response time compared to that when the content is obtained from the origin server as shown in Figure 1 In the example given in the 223gure if a client contacts the nearest server which is server 1 to retrieve content via path 3 the response time is shorter than that if the content is obtained from the origin server via path 1 Furthermore network usage is reduced and optimized on path 3 because backbone traf\223c is reduced Regarding to reduction of the response time for a particular client three factors have to be considered i network delay ii server processing time and iii traf\223c density Our research is mainly aimed at minimizing the above three factors by employing a new model of redirection management The DNS is a distributed database containing records of a name-to-address mapping system by caching resource records at intermediate name servers Each record has a time-to-live  Janaka Wijekoon  Rajitha Tennekoon  Fumito Yamaguchi  Hiroaki Nishi  204The increase in the amount of digital data transferred between contents Servers and Clients in a network causes problems created by congestion when downloading big web 223les streaming media etc Content Delivery Networks CDNs are introduced to overcome such problems by redirecting the Clients request to the nearest Server However as the number of people accessing Internet increases rapidly the performance of CDN is reduced resulting in network congestion at times To solve these problems we propose an architecture in which a new management method is employed to redirect the Clients request using a content-based Router called the Service-oriented Router SoR This method is more effective than the currently implemented traditional DNS-based request redirection RR The SoR is a special router that can perform a deep packet inspection of the packet streams Our experiments were based on analytical modeling as well as test bed experiments and they con\223rmed that the response time in the Router-based RR was less than that in the DNS-based RR by 23.3 In addition our test bed experiments showed that the RTT in the Router-based RR is less than that in the DNS-based RR by 7.7 002 201 202 261 247

and Queuing Theory 25 An Energy-ef\223cient Routing Protocol can be considered to be implemented for the next-CDN technology In this paper the research works start from basic assumptions in queuing theory with M/M/1 queuing model and introduces new features of router-based routing redirection in CDN that resemble a more realistic and general model This way the impact on performance of important parameters such as the routing redirection probability network delay and response time can be studied Moreover it is worthwhile establishing some dependencies and relationships among these parameters as empirical analytic results are always 223nite and cover only a limited variability range of the CDN parameters VII C ONCLUSION We adopted empirical analytical and experimental approaches to study RR performance achieved by different methodology Although the service rate in our model which employs Routerbased redirection is 50 of the service rate of a regular Router it achieved a reduced response time of about 11 to 14 ms with optimal redirection between the two Servers This response time is 23.3 of that in DNS-based redirection For the performance result based on when the probability of DNSservers cache miss is 0.05 and load is 0.05 the response time of the Router-based system is 64 ms i.e 4.4 lower than that of the DNS-based system In a congested situation when the DNS-servers cache miss is 0.75 and load is 0.90 the response time of Router-based is 0.64s i.e 44.8 lower than that of the DNS-based system In addition we conducted a test bed implementation of the Router-based redirection method The RTT for the Router-based scheme is 26 ms i.e 7.7 lower than that of the DNS-based scheme A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by Funds for Integrated Promotion of

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todays cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlights data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlights hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlights method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
