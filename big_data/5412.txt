Pers onalized Recommendation based on WAR  Zhang Junyan Scho ol of Economics and Management University of Electronic Science and Technology of China Chengdu, China e-mail: jyzhang@uestc.edu.cn Sh ao Peiji Scho ol of Economics and Management  University of Electronic Science and Technology of China  Chengdu, China  e-mail: shaopj@uestc.edu.cn   Abst ract 227 Personalized recommendation is the process of customizing Web site to meet the requirement of specific user 
by analyzing user's browsing behavior and extracting knowledge based on Web logs. Association rules mining technology is widely adopted in this field. However, the resulting association patterns can not effectively predict user\222s future browsing behavior because of the low similarity degree between resulting rules and user's browsing behavior. In this paper, we assign a weight to each item in a transaction to reflect the interest degree, which extends the traditional association rule method. We also proposed weighted association rule \(WAR\ associating a weight with each item in resulting association rules. Each Web page is assigned to a weight according to interest degree and three key factors i.e. visit frequency, stay duration and operation time. A novel personalized recommendation mechanism is presented based 
our proposed WAR. The weighted measurement in our personalized recommendation can be used to determine the importance of Web pages for user. We try to acquire user\222s requirement more precisely so as to more useful Web pages are discovered and recommended for user  Keywords-personalizd recommendation; weighted association rule \(WAR\data mining; Web personalization I   I NTRODU CTIO N  In r ecent  year large amounts of information emerge on the Internet. It is convenient for users to retrieve information and discover knowledge. However, the dramatic growth and rapid expansion of Internet information often make Internet 
users suffer from the information overload problem Personalizatio one o f the p r o m i s ing m e t hods to de al  with this the problem. Users\222 visit behaviors can be analyzed to extracted knowledge, which can make the content and structure of websites to adapt to users\222 need Recently, researches on Web mining greatly facilitate us to tackle this problem. Most of developed systems in this field are based on Web usage mining Man y w orks a r e very concerned about Web usage mining is  considered as the most potential method to achieve personalization [1  3  4 5 6  7   8 T h e know ledge t o  describe users\222 browsing behaviors is found out, which help system to personalize Web sites according to each user\222s behaviors and characteristics of each individual site. Web 
usage mining applies common data mining technology to discovery usage patterns, forms Web data, and makes recommendations based on them. These systems are mainly focused on analyzing Web usage logs, finding out patterns from the data and making recommendations based the extracted knowledge [5  9   T h e trad it i o n al recommender systems make decision mainly based on users\222 clear feedbacks for different items   1 1  U n li k e t h i s   these technologies can discovery users\222 preferences from their implicit feedbacks, such as Web pages they have visited In this paper, we concern on the association-mining method in Web usage mining, which is widely used for data analysis  6   Assoc i ation Rule \(A R m i n ing has been  s u cce s s f u lly 
applied in Web page recommender systems and  Web site personalization, and it is easily to be extended to large data  8 1 1] [12]. Ho we ver, th e way  t o co m b i n e t h e  weight of Web page with AR is never mentioned in previous studies about personalized recommender system Weighted Association Rules mining can distribute different weights for different items to reflect their different importance [13  is a v iab l e m e th o d o f  AR m o d el i n  the process of improving personalization. Two methods are proposed to calculate weight of itemset: total weight and average weigh. Weighted support of an itemset is defined as product of the itemset support and itemset weight [1 Itemset weight is defined as the average weight of the items 
in the set. Weighted support of an itemset is defined as the ratio of weight of the transactions containing the itemset relative to weight of all transactions. Both methods are sought to allocate the larger weight to the more important items, so as to discovery important but less frequency itemsets and associated rules. However, both methods assume a fixed weight for each item is assigned, while in Web usage mining and personalized recommender system environment, a Web page may have different importance in different sessions In many works about recommendation based on Association rules and personalization, the time spent on each Web page has not been considered as an evaluation criterion for the importance of the Web page. In other words, all Web pages visited in user browsing mode are equally important 
for themselves, while ignoring the differences of Web page importance in another user session. Binary weight is used to extract matching active user with the rules in the basis of association rule [13 Si m i lar ity  m ea sure m e n t is co m b i n e d  with association rule [11   S i m i larity b etwee n ite m s is measured according to rules so as to make recommendation 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 V12-108 C 9 78 1 42 4 4 7 237 6   2 6  0 0  201 0 I E EE 


and the n the most similar items are discovered for active users [8  Du r a t i on is used to as sign we ight f or each  We b  page, and significant itemset graph is adopted to improve the efficiency of recommendation Traditional association rules are extended in our work each item is assigned a weight to reflect users\222 interests about each item in the transactions. Then a new recommendation mechanism is put forward based on the proposed weighted association rule mining method Operation times, visit frequency, stay duration \(i.e. time spent on each Web page\ are used to assign a quantitative weight to each Web page. Here, if a Web page is saved printed, sent, edited and so on, we call it one time operation This paper is organized as follows: in section 2, our weighting schema is presented. We give the weighted association rule in section 3. In section 4, we propose personalized recommendation mechanism. At last, we conclude our paper in section 5 II  W EIGHTI NG S CHE M A FOR W EB PA GE  P  p 1  p 2  p n repre sen t the set of Web pages visited by users and stored in Web server logs, and each Web page is identified by its associated URL. We also let T  t 1  t 2  t m de note the set of user transactions, where t i T and t i P  In order t o achieve high-quality recommendation, an n dimensional vector over Web page space is used to indicate each transaction t and t  p 1  1   p 2  2  p n  n   where i repr e sent the weight of Web page p i in transac tion t  Here i also ca n re flect user\222s interest in p i  As  the recommendation is based on previous users\222 behaviors, so the weight schema must be able to accurately model the user\222s interest. However, the recommendation methods mentioned previously do not distinguish the importance of different Web pages. All visited Web page are treated equally regardless of whether it is useful to users or not. The difference of Web page importance is ignored and a page for each user session in the different degrees of interest After all, user may have different interest in each Web page in a transaction. Sometimes user finds a Web page is of no value and has no interest in it only after entering into this Web page, which makes irrelevant Web pages to be recorded in the Web logs. Therefore, it is imperfect that all visited Web pages are used equally to obtain user\222s interest and predict user\222s behavior. Accordingly, a weight is expected to measure user\222s interest to a Web page in usage-based recommender system In this paper, we proposed a weighting schema, which obtains user\222s interest of Web pages by calculating Web logs In order to measure users\222 interests more accurately and recommend more useful Web pages for users, three key factors, i.e. operation times, visit frequency and stay duration are used to estimate the importance of Web pages in a transaction Visit frequency is the number of times that a Web page is visited by different users. Obviously, users have more interest in the Web page with a higher visit frequency. When we calculate visit frequency, the number of external links and internal links of a Web page should be considered Clearly, a Web page with large number of external links and internal links has greater probability to be visited by users Thus, we normalize visit frequency F  p follows    pLpL pF pF I E total   Where F total  p ep r esents user\222s total visit times of a Web page p in a transaction L E  p and L I  p e the number of external links and internal links of Web page p  respectively Stay duration is selected as one of the weighting parameters because it can reflect the relative importance of each Web page. In general, user may spend more time on more useful Web page. However, stay duration is often affected by the length of Web page. Therefore, we normalize stay duration according to the length of Web page, i.e. the total bytes of Web page. The formula of stay duration D  p  given as follows     pLength pD pD total   Where D total  p represents us er 222s real stay duration of a Web page p in a transaction Length  p is the total bytes of the Web page D  p denotes the normalized stay duration Operation time of Web page O  p is the third key factor to assign weight to each Web page O  p m of user\222s operation of a Web page. The possible operations include saving, editing, copying, adding to favorites, printing, and so on. So it can be obtained as follows Pp t pOpO    Where O t  p is  each user\222s operation time of Web page p in transaction t  Accordingly, we assign a weight to each Web page in a transaction based on the above three factors as follows  pOpDpF   III  W EIGHTE D A SS OC OATION RULE FOR RECOMMENDATION  The tradi t ional association rule is extended in this section Each item in the transaction is assigned a weight to reflect user\222s interest. In turn, this makes each item in a resulting association rule to association with a weight, which is called weighted association rule \(WAR By use of WAR in electronic commerce, the products with high profit margins should be paid more attention WAR mining assigns different weights for different items which can improve the performance of personalized recommendation 


A Web page in different sessions may have different importance. So in this paper, a greater weight is assigned to a more important Web page to facilitate us to find important itemsets and association rules but with lower visit frequency and operation times First of all, Ap  s ext e nde d acc or d i ng  to the  weighted rules with association parameters described as follows In a transaction t the weight of an itemset can be  den ote as t   whi ch can be obtained by use of the average weight of all items in itemset   k k i i t 1      Where k is the number of items in the itemset   In order to dis tinguishing the difference between different transactions, the transaction weight  t s  defined to calculate the support of each itemset  t   can be obtained as follows k t     21   Accordingly, weighted support of itemset appeared in all transaction can be calculated as follows  Tt ti i i t S     Now we define weighted confidence of weighted association rule C      XS YXS YXC   Therefore, the rule r in weighted association rule mining can be described as follows r  b 1  b 2 205 b k   h k 1  h k 2 205 h k  n   1   2 205 k  n  C   R  And  R is t he set of all weighted association rules  IV  RE C OMMENDATION M EC HAN ISM  A reco m mendation set can be calculated for active user session according to association rule mining. Sliding window [1  is adop ted to control the nu m b er of We b pag es which match with the association rules in the session Therefore, it is very important to maintain a historical depth in recommender system In previous works  1 1   1 3  a f i xed size sli din g  window is used in the active user session to obtain the historical depth of current user and generate recommendations The size of sliding window is n and move clockwise over the active user session. Recommendation value is affected by only the last visited n Web pages. It is not appropriate to represent user\222s current requirement of information by use of the earlier part of user session because most users go back and forth to find what they want when browsing a Website. However, the last visited n Web pages are treated equally in this method, which results in not distinguish the importance of Web pages for user. Therefore only the Web pages what user is interested in are used to achieve personalized recommendation Despite recently visited Web pages in active user session are more suitable for recommendation, but in many cases user will have unexpected behaviors. Sometimes, user finds a very interesting one after browsing many Web pages, and spends much time on it. And then this process is repeated Therefore, the weight and new degree of Web page should be taken into consideration simultaneously when personalized recommendation is made In order to signify Web pages in active user session, the new degree of a Web page is defined as follows  1  wsize pN i   Where size  w is the size of sliding window, and i is the location of Web page in the sliding window. 1 is assigned to the first visited Web page. Obviously, the last visited Web page has the largest new degree value. For the purpose of reflect the impact of new degree, weight of each Web page is normalized as follows n j j i i 1     The higher user interest of a Web page, the larger the values of new degree and  i So the user interest degree of a Web page can be defined as follows    2 ii ii i pN pN    Now an effective mechanism is given for personalized recommendation based on weighted association rules Weighted association rules of each URL are extracted from Web logs, the generated rules express behavior characteristics of user\222s browsing on Web site. Before we make recommendations, the n weighted association rules which are most similar to active user sessions are searched out by use of similarity degree Each weighted association rule r described as section 3 can be represented as a set of Web page-weight pairs. Thus both weighted association rules and active user session are 


treate d as n dimensional vectors over the Web page space in Web site. Left side of r is denoted as vector r L  1   2 205 n  i f  and only if p i r L  The acti v e user session is also denoted as a n dimensional vector E  e 1  e 2 205 e n An d e i is a weight  as sociation with the corresponding web page. If user has visited p i in t his user session  e i   i other wise  e i  Accor dingly, the similarity degree  bet w een active user session and weighted association rules which illustrate relationships among Web pages can be calculated as follows n i ii ii e e 1  2     In order to determine which items are to be recommended, we also calculate a recommendation degree  for each Web page as follows  pXCpXE    So the largest recommendation degree is chosen as the recommendation to the active user session V  C ONCL USIONS  In th i s paper, we proposed a novel personalized recommendation mechanism based on weighted association rules \(WAR\odel. Each Web page is assigned to a weight to reflect its importance. The value of weight is decided by three key factors: visit frequency, stay duration and operation times. The Weighted association rules of each URL are extracted from Web logs of, and similarity degree of active user session is calculated according to WAR. Then most similar rules to the active user session with the highest weighted confidence are discovered. Finally, the largest recommendation degree is chosen as the recommendation to the active user session by evaluating each rule in terms of the similarity and weighted confidence. Our method will try to predict which Web pages are most likely to be visited by users, so it can improve the performance of personalized recommendation R EF E RENCES  1  M Nakagawa, B. Mobasher.

E.g.: Shelf height B  Time Variant data The data set provided contained purchase invoices of a single month. Hence, the analysis carried to was limited to the data of only one month. If more data is available, a time variant analysis with the appropriate weightings can also be undertaken C  Time Spent by customer in various Zones Since the data provided did not contain the time dimension the analysis done in this paper misses out on the time spent by customers on different products in various zones which can have an influence on the attractions of the products and their locations and hence, can produce more accurate results for more appropriate recommendations  D  Mulitple Entry Points to a store The store layout has been constrained with a single entry and exit point. Variations in the same can have considerable effects on the results E  Deviating from path Customers The shortest paths assigned to the customers, by the approach used in this paper are not applicable for the entire set of customers. This is because there may be some customers who deviate from the shortest path while traversing the store.

7 ForestCoverType  data is shown in Figure 6 Appendix as an example The tool takes this data as input and produces the hierarchical clusters of data by setting different clustering parameters With the help of this tool user can see  the generated hierarchy of the clusters along with the data present in each cluster. For the experiment we sele cted the row wise clustering option and the algorithm used f or this type of clustering was the Euclidean algorithm. The reason for this choice is that Euclidean distance is the m ost commonly used type of distance measure in cluster analysis It uses raw data instead of standardized data to compute the distances Using the complete linkage method the hierarchal clusters are produced, it can be seen from the Figu re 2 that 3 distinct clusters are produced where each one of them is having its specific hierarchy B Automatic Schema generation In this step the cluster results file which was ex ported using the HCE tool becomes the input of the automat ic schema builder. We developed a prototype to automat e the process of schema generation The prototype takes t he clustered data and generates the schema of any part icular type such as star snowflake or galaxy/constellatio n The prototype has been developed using the C sharp C  programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005 Once the hierarchical clustering has been done, the  next step is to extract this hierarchical information in the form of cluster information tables which are fed into the d eveloped prototype called Automatic Schema Generator Figure  3 depicts the main interface of the Automatic Schema Generator having the clustered relationship data C luster names are the abbreviations which are formed using the first letters of each cover type for example clus ter name for C1 is PCD, which means cover types of Ponderosa pine Cottonwood and Douglas-fir PCD All other names are abbreviated by using the first alphabetical letters  After reading the cluster relationship file the bu tton of Create Schema as shown in the following diagram displays the schema selection window. Figure 4 show s the schema selection window of automatic schema builder  Using this selector window cluster name and type o f schema can be selected to build database in the dat abase server. User can select from star, snowflake and ga laxy or constellation options of schema type using the radi o button The “Generate” button on the bottom of schema selec tor window performs the following major functions 1\Generates automatic database in the database serv er 2\Creates dimension and fact tables for the schema type selected 3\Manage relationships among the tables 4\Upload data in the fact and dimension tables from the clustered file After performing the above mentioned functions the  control is passed to the schema visualization windo w which gives a glimpse of the schema created automatically  as shown in Figure 5  Fig 2: Hierarchical clusters generated by HCE tool Fig 3 User interface of automatic schema builder Fig 4 Schema Selector window 41 


Fig 5 Schema visualization window V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we reviewed the literature regarding  the integration of OLAP with data mining and automatic generation of OLAP schema. Literature review reveal ed the fact that none of the previous works targeted at th e automatic schema generation from the mined data set  Furthermore the works in the past pose a number of limitations. The major limitation of the previous w ork was the absence of a model that can produce the three b asic types of OLAP schema star, snowflake and galaxy Based on these observations we presented the model for th e integration of data mining and OLAP along with the automatic generation of OLAP schema. We have develop ed a prototype for the automatic schema generation Th is developed prototype takes mined data and produces t he schema of user’s choice Finally we implemented the  proposed model and evaluated the results with the h elp of experiment It is evident from the result that the prototype system overcomes the manual schema design and implementation requirement in the data warehousing environment We are working on the enhancement of t he proposed model for automatic schema generation One  possible way of enhancement is the use of other dat a mining techniques along with OLAP for the schema generation. Further more, we are exploring how OLAP can be further extended and enhanced to meet the new challenges and to make it more effective efficient  and intelligent OLAP REFERENCES 1  S   C h a u d h u r i  a n d  U   D a y a l   A n  o v e r v i e w  o f  d a t a  warehousing and OLAP technology ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 26 1997\, pp 6574 2  A   C u z z o c r e a   D   S a c c a  a n d  P   S e r a f i n o   A  h i e r a rchy driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualizati on of multidimensional data cubes in Proc of 8th Int’l Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery \(DaWak Springer Verlag 2006\, pp. 106-119 3  S   M a n s m a n n  a n d  M   S c h o l l   E x p l o r i n g  O L A P  a g g r e gates with hierarchical visualization techniques, in Proc. of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2007\, pp. 1067-1073 4  F a y y a d  U  M   P i a t e s k y S h a p i n o  G    S m y t h  P   a n d  U thurusany R From datamining to knowledge discovery: An overvie w,”in Proc. of Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery MIT Press, pp. 134 5   S   G o i l  a n d  A   C h o u d h a r y    H i g h  p e r f o r m a n c e  O L AP and data mining on parallel computers Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 391-417, Dec. 1997 6   S   A s g h a r   D   A l a h a k o o n  a n d  A   H s u    E n h a n c i n g  OLAP functionality using selforganizing neural networks  Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1-20, March 2004 7   R   B   M e s s a o u d   O   B o u s s a i d  a n d  S   R a b a s e d a    A new OLAP aggregation based on the AHC technique,” in Proc. of the 7th ACM Int’l Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP DOLAP ACM New York, 2004, pp. 65-72 8   J   H a n    T o w a r d s  o n l i n e  a n a l y t i c a l  m i n i n g  i n  l arge databases ACM SIGMOD Record vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 97-107, March 1998 9   V   M a r k l   F   R a m a s a k  a n d  R   B a y e r    I m p r o v i n g  OLAP performance by multidimensional hierarchical clustering in Proc of the 1999 Int’l Symposium on Database Engineering and Applica tions IDEAS 1999, p. 165 10   V   M a r k l  a n d  R   B a y e r    P r o c e s s i n g  r e l a t i o n a l  OLAP queries with UB-trees and multidimensional hierarchical clusteri ng in Proc of the Int’l.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
