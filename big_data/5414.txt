Although some confidence association rules is high, but the support is very low, indicating that the association rules and practical opportunity to small, it is not important. the problem of mining association rules is found to have a user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence of all association rules, which found that the support of association rules and confidence are not less than the minimum support and minimum confidence III  R OU GH S ET T 
HEOR Y IN A SSO CIATION R ULES M IN ING  In p ractical application, a lot of knowledge are based on information form, Information systems generally deal with the following main steps: First, data preparation, including data discretization, data cleaning, depending on the issue of the form given information table knowledge representation system, incompatible with the object and remove redundant objects, the decision to establish the compatibility table is prepare  for the data reduction. And then examine whether the conditional attribute can be omitted, get the simple attribute set, a multi-lateral compression of information table 
if the information table reflects the control rules, then the equivalent of all the control rules to reduce the antecedent conditions. On this basis, on the basis of value reduction to reduce the number of properties and individuals, the final extraction rules is to access information systems inherent laws. Using rough set theory for data mining, extraction of knowledge rules, the most important thing is based on rough set attribute reduction and rule redundancy value reduction 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 V11-236 C 9 78 1 42 4 4 7 237 6   2 6  0 0  2010 IEEE

Mining Decision table or something before the association rules in the database, should be handled in accordance with the following general steps to reduce the mining complex, reduce errors, false, redundant rule generation Processing steps are as follows Step 1: data preprocessing, the continuous attributes in decision table will be converted to discrete values Step 2: Using rough set reducts of condition attributes, delete redundant attribute, use the resolution matrix \(difference matrix\ complete the reduction and the core. When there are several core values, core values with the smallest component to extract simple rules Step 3: Mining association rules is based on Boolean continuous attribute values to go through a cluster analysis to classify the property value, obtained after the reduction of decision table into a Boolean type. The decision table can be treated as transaction databases V  W ITH CONCLUSIONS BASED ON ROUGH SET OF A SSOCIATION R ULES  M IN ING  A  Algo rithm Apriori-MARDA Introduction In this paper, research project constraints algorithm Apriori algorithm is improved by, a band of Association Rules Mining Algorithm Apriori-MARDA \(Mining Associate Ruleswith Decision Atrribute\ and optimized variants.The example indicates that this method can reduce the association rule mining of time and space complexity improve efficiency of data mining How to improve the efficiency of the current rules mining algorithm of association rule mining is an important research topic, the relevance of the general conclusion is no domain, although it can try to find the relationship between the various properties and dependence, and to fully explore the database .But aimlessly analysis have to pay a high price when there is a definite goal, which is concluded when the domain is known \(from the constraints of the project point of view are bound, that is, only certain items can appear in the rules right, as a rule after the piece\reduce the number of candidate sets, the search space, and count, so to some extent improved the efficiency of the algorithm Apriori-MARDA algorithm aims to use the reduction of rough directly from the decision table after the extract with the rules of Association.

 innovative optimizations in itemsets closure calculations and their support. Furthermore, employing an optimal technique in time and memory, it quickly detects and removes duplicate closed itemsets. This algorithm excels in time and memory all other algorithms in almost all situations  V  Experimental Evaluation Due to high number of discussed algorithms for frequent closed itemsets mining, just performance results of the best algorithms ,i.e.  Closet+, FP-close and DCI-Closed are shown. These results have been tested on databases Chess, Retail and  Pumsb  Chess and  Pumsb  are dense databases and Retail is among sparse databases  Figure 2,3, and 4 illustrate of the results of execution of  DCI-Closed, FP-Close, and  Closet+ on databases Chess, Retail ,and Pumsb  respectively  0 100 200 300 400 500 600 20 25 30 35 40 45 minimum support Runtime\(second  DCIClos ed FPClos e Closet  Figure2.

Execution Time in Pumsb  Database As shown above, DCI-Close has better execution time compared with other two algorithms. In figures 2 and 4, the execution time of algorithm FP-Close is better than Closet+. But in figure 3, Closet+ works better than FP-Close. It is due to the fact that in Retail database the number of frequent items is high, and therefore the time given for formation of corresponding array from related FP-tree is high, whereas FP-tree traversal with optimized strategies employed in Closet consumes substantially less time VI  Conclusion A significant method of condensed representation involves using frequent closed itemsets as their number is fewer than frequent itemsets. The frequent closed itemsets are as powerful as all frequent itemsets, and they increase the effect of mining through removing redundant rules. In recent years, due to the importance of frequent closed itemsets mining many algorithms have been introduced which use various strategies. In this study, the most popular algorithms of frequent closed itemsets  mining have been analyzed. The experiments show that each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages regarding its use in different sparse and dense databases. Among them however, DCI-Close algorithm has higher performance due to various innovative optimizations in closure calculations of itemsets, preventing generation of duplicate closed itemsets, and no extra closure operation References 1  R.

   for overlooking the overall software development process and playing a crucial role in making important decisions  5.1.3. The Criterion Set As stated earlier, criterion is the attribute for which favorability of an alternativ e is calculated. The criterion set defined for this case study comprises of Reusability  Meeting Operational Requirements and Meeting Project Deadline By reusability, we mean, the amount of reuse of different functionalities that ca n be achieved from the previously developed system on Mine detection training tool. Meeting operational requirements implies how effectively a desired operational capability can be satisfied by an alternative. For example, some alternative might lack a certain operational capability like database support whereas another may support it with enhanced features. Meeting project deadline stresses on the fact whether the project requirements can be satisfactorily achieved within the stipulated deadline which in our case was around one year  5.1.4. The Alternatives To resolve the concerned issu e, the stakeholders decided to choose one software platfor m for developing the mine detection training tool among the three stated alternatives Adobe Director  Adobe Flash  Open GL were chosen as the three possible alternatives along with some justifications. Adobe Flash was chosen as one of the alternatives because; the stakeholders already had a previous developed system for mine detection developed using Adobe Flash    Figure 6. Mine Detection System Along With Three Alternatives One of the considerations involved here was to enhance this system rather than develop a new system from scratch. Same reason applied to choosing Adobe Director as one of the other alternatives. Open GL was picked up as one of the three alternatives in the case when a new development had to be started Open GL is an advanced software development platform and it could have served as a good platform for the mine detection training system  Figure 6 summarizes the pro ject and its three alternatives positions available  5.2. Prioritizing The Criteria  For an effective decision making, we had to weigh the criteria according to their im portance in the decision making process. For this, we choose Analytic Hierarchy process because of its effectiveness in performing pair wise comparison of elements .Table 2 shows the ranking table used for comparing the two criteria  Table 2. Criteria Comp arison Table For AHP  Value a ij  Comparison Description 1 Criteria i and j are of equal importance 3 Criteria i is weakly more important than j 5 Criteria i is strongly more important than j 7 Criteria i is very strongly more important than j 9 Criteria i is absolutely more important than j   Table 3.

   Table 4. Normalized Criteria Comparison Table In AHP   Reusability Meeting Operational Requirements Meeting project Deadline Reusability 0.157 0.148 0.272 Meeting Operational Requirements 0.789 0.744 0.636 Meeting Project Deadline 0.052 0.106 0.090  Table 3 and Table 4 show the weight values of the three criterions as compared to each other using the AHP process. These weights have been decided by the stakeholders after discussions among themselves Average weights can be derived from Table 4 as follows Reusability- 0.193 Meeting Operational Requirements- 0.724 Meeting Project Deadline- 0.083 These weights represent the priority of each criterion on a scale of 0 to 1  5.3. Argumentation Tree  We develop argumentation tree for each and every alternative separately. The ar guments are stated by stake holders and assembled under the alternative but they target a specific cr iterion. These arguments can either be supporting or attacking each other or their respective alternative nodes. We present three figures, where each figure represents the argumentation hierarchy for one alternative. Rectangular boxes represent the alternatives with the name of the alternative under it. Ovals represent the criteria with their descr iption. The arguments are specified by labels A, B, C for alternative Adobe flashŽ, Adobe DirectorŽ and Open GLŽ respectively Along with the labels, the arguments also have indexes associated with them. Beneath the labels are two boxes The box on left shows the weight of the argument whereas the box on right shows the priority of the stakeholder who specifies the argument  Once the argument has been sp ecified, the user enters its weight. We first reassess the weights of the arguments using priority reassessment discussed in h e n us ing the techniques specified in [11 w e red u ce t h e arg u m e n t s  to a single level. Finally, the weighted summation of the arguments with the criteria weights helps us evaluate the final weights for the decision matrix. It is important to note here that, the aggregation method used for calculating the favorability is a weighted summation  The three argumentation hierarchies for the three alternatives are presented in the Figures 7, 8, and 9. The diagrams contain arguments, their weights and the stakeholders priorities     Figure 7. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Flash   Figure 8. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Director 150 


     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnt create sound clips  A5.1 We dont need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIs   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
