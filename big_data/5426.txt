6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
