Keywords Social View; Model; Tagging System; Association Rule; Recommendation System I   I NTRODUCTION  Social tagging systems such as Facebook, YouTube del.icio.us, Flickr become popular recent years and have achieved widespread success 2 where resources \(like urls video, bookmarks, photos\re tagged\(stored\ navigating later and shared with friends or the public. In Social tagging systems, users are allowed to annotate resources freely with any words or tags they want. Through the hyperlinks of tags 
people can retrieve a large number of resources attached with theses tags, including the resources having the same description by others It is clear that, user modeling or profiling is a critical step before making recommendations in tagging systems. So user profiles must be able to reflect the reality \(accuracy\ users\222 long-term interests, as many domains of user preferences as possible. VSM \(Vector Space Model\ is the most popular method applied for user modeling in recommendation algorithms or systems. In content-based filtering algorithms user profile is a vector of weights derived from word frequency or TF*IDF, and each component for the keywords of content 
Among the collaborative filtering systems, user is modeled by a vector of ratings, and one for each items. Other methods like XML, Graph are also applied Tags are the comprehension and abstraction of users contenting what they pay attention to. Consequently, tags become novel sources of information about user interests Typically, tagging systems use VSM to model user interests and each component of vector is the weight of tags used by the active user. However, tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned [4 m o re i m p o r t a n t l y  t h e u s e r  profile is based on personal view only. So there is a limitation to express users\222 long-term interests fully and effectively in the 
state-of-art approaches In this paper, we propose a method to extend user profiles applying association rules from the social view \(other users with similar interest topics\ as using only personal view to profile is subjective and incomplete in a social network like tagging systems. We argue that social view is also important as personal view and could enrich user profiles. The outline of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related works in tag-based profiling. Section 3 presents the proposed approach for user modeling. Experimental results of exploiting these profiles for making recommendations are reported in Section4. Finally, in Section5, We will make a conclusion and 
present our future work II  R ELATED W ORKS AND P ROBLEM ANALYSIS  Many works have focused on building tag-based profiles in tagging system, taking account of the fact that tags which are more frequently chosen are much more important for describing user preferences s a v ect or of  w e i g h t ed tags modeling user interest. And the weight of tag is determined by the order and capacity of tag o u s es  weighted vector of tags to describe user interest, but tag weights are based on inverse tag frequency. In [3  a ve c t o r  o f  weighted tags is obtained using tag frequency of occurrence in 
resources user tagged. The mentioned approaches above all apply VSM to characterize user preferences, and each component of vector is the weight of the tags used to annotate resources. The difference is the method of weighting There are some drawbacks of using a vector of weighted tags for profiling. First of all, from the dataset analysis in Section 4, a user often employs about 2 tags to describe the resource he enjoys. So tag order is unavailable or rather 978-1-4244-5874-5/10/$26.00 \2512010 IEEE 


irrelevant in this scenario. Secondly, as a result of the long-tail of tagging system, a user annotates only a small percentage of items. Furthermore, tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned. So userís interest which spans across different domains cannot be embraced by a unique vect h i r dl y   u s er i s prof i l e d f r o m pers on al v i e w onl y  and social view is ignored. But social view contains novel information which could enrich user profiles To address the limitations of VSM based user profiles, [2 proposes to hybrid content and tag-based profiles. But content based profiles rely on the information retrieve technology. The idea of using semantic relationships among tags in tag-based profiles has been explored in [7 w h ic h th e se m a n tic  distance between two tags is calculated based on cooccurrence statistics and common sense reasoning using ConceptNet  e v e r, as tag s are ch os e n f r eel y  an d arbitrary, besides, tags are often polysemous and synonymous All this will bring challenges to the computing of semantic distance between tags. The idea of constructing user profiles from tagging data has been proposed in  T h e y us e a prof i l e  graph to represent a user, where nodes are tags used by this user and edges are the relations between tags Social tagging systems could be depicted by a triad  R uid iid tag  here user uid has annotated resource iid with tag  Fig.1 Tagging System As show in Fig.1, in tagging system, people may be interest in the same or similar items and describe them with tags personally. State of art profiling methods uses tags chosen from personal vocabulary, thatís to say modeling from personal view. However, personal view often contains only part of user preference as untagged items does not represent a lack of interest. Although, people use personal vocabulary to tag items, common interests or topics are among the similar items tagged by user. People with common interests or topics are named Friends in recommendation systems. What friends interested is helpful for us to mine the potential interest of user So we propose to model user from social view, in other words use the information of what friends are interested to extend user profiles. The enriched profiles are much more accuracy to characterize user and can represent the diversity of user interest III  U SER M ODELING  As userís interests often span across many domains, instead of a vector of weighted tags, each user is profiled as a set of interest topics. We propose to annotate user interest by interest topics as user annotates resource by tags. Tags are the comprehension and abstraction of users to contents they pay attention to. So tags become novel resources suggesting the interest topics. In this regard, user profile in this paper is defined as follows    the interest topics of uid Profile uid  1 Here, interest topics of user uid could be harvested from personally tagging activities, and the tagging behaviors from friends of user uid. This is the idea of hybrid personal view and social view for user profiling. Personal view regards tags specified by user uid only 6 while social view considers tags specified by the friends of user uid User profile in this paper can be harvested by two steps, as show in Fig.2  Fig.2 Two steps of Profiling We will give details about how the interest topics are mined in the follow sections. Then a novel recommendation algorithm is proposed to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the modeling method we introduced A  Details of User Modeling Algorithm The detail steps for building user profiles are as follows Input: all the triads R uid, iid, tag\, describing that user uid has annotated item iid with  tag Output: Enriched user profiles Profile uid\ = {the interest topics of uid Steps   From personal view, interest topics could be mined from the tags used to annotate  resources by user uid So Profile_PersonalView uid\{tags used by user uid   From social view, interest topics are mined from tags used by the friends of user uid. There are several substeps as follows a  Get the resources ItemSet uid\agged by user uid 


b  Find the similar resources        SimilarItemSet uid item titem ItemSet uid item titem rsim item titem T    Here   rsim item titem is similarity between item and titem T is the threshold that two items get to be similar c  In tagging systems, we treat each post  tuseritemtag  as a transaction with  key user item and tags as commodity.  Here   item ItemSet uid SimilarItemSet uid  Then association rules is applied for discovering frequent tag patterns of the posts. And these frequent tag patterns are similar interest topics There is a parameter called support which is a threshold for defining frequent tag patterns. So    Pr _ _ _ ofiel SocialView uid tag patterns support tag patterns support  Than  _\(\_ profile Profile Pers onalView uid Pro file SocialVi uid ew uid   B  Mining Interest Topics From Personal View Regard with personal view, tags represent what user preferences directly. So we get Profile_PersonView user profile from personal view\y choosing tags from the tag set of user uid used in tagging system  123 _ profile PersonalView uid tag t gag ta  2 As from the dataset analysis in Section 4, a user often employs about 2 tags to describe the resource he enjoys. So we argue that all tags contained in _\(uid Profile Pers onalView has the same weight, they represent different aspects of user interest. Then, user interest from personal view is annotated by tags which are also used to annotate resources C  Mining Interest Topics From Social View   Item Similarity The item similarity rsim iid1, iid2> between iid1 and iid2 is computed by \(3   1  2 1 2  1  2 P iid P iid rism iid iid P iid P iid    3 Here, iid1 and iid2 are the ID of items in tagging system. P\(x\ is the tag collection which people have used to annotate item x 1  2 P iid P iid  is the number of the common tags 1  2 P iid P iid  is the total number of tags associated with the two items Note that when iid1=iid2, i.e. iid1 and iid2 are the same item 1 2 1 rism iid iid  Furthermore the similarity by \(3\ above is symmetrical   Simplified Association Rule for Mining Interest Topics Following the original definition by Agrawal 1 the problem of association rule mining is defined as: Let 12345    i I ii ii  be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let 12345      T ttttt  be a set of transactions called the database Each transaction in T has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I A rule is defined as an implication of the form   XY   where YI  and XY   The support support  X of an itemset X is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset We will use a simple example to illustrate how it works. As show in TABLE.1 TABLE.1 Example Data Set Transaction Key user, item Tags As Commodity 1 t  2 t  3 t  4 t  5 t  1 u  1 i  1 0 1 0 0 2 u  2 i  0 1 1 0 0 3 u  3 i  1 0 0 1 0 4 u  4 i  1 0 0 1 0 5 u  5 i  0 1 1 0 0 Here, set of tags is 12345  tttt t and a small database containing the tags \(1 codes presence and 0 absence of an tag in a post\ is shown in the table to the right. And 12345    i ii ii is a group of resources with similarity greater than threshold. Besides, suppose 1 u  is active user and the threshold of support for frequent tag patterns is 0.4. In this example support 12   tt 2/5=0.4 and support 23  tt 2/5=0.4. Then we get 2 t and 4 t as  the potential interest topics of the active user. So 124 _ P rofile SocialView u t t   IV  M AKING R ECOMMENDATION  A  Recommend Tags for Un-annotated Resource For un-annotated resources but known to the active user uid, we could recommend some correlative tags when he/her is tagging. Recommendations are made according to \(4    e tag   4 or ignore tag   IsToR commend tag id recommend P tag profile uid refuse P tag profile u id d id i   012\012  Here ,P\(id\ is the profile of item id B  Recommend Un annotated Resources to Active User We could also recommend some un-annotated resources which are unknown to active user uid.  \(5\s applied to 


estimate the likeability Probability uid,iid\of active user on unknown items      P rofile uid P iid Probabi lity uid iid Profile uid   5 Here uid is the ID of active user and iid is the unknown resource. P\(iid\s the tag collection people have used to annotate resource iid V  E XPERIMENT R ESULTS  A  Dataset Analysis  A movie rating datasets called MovieLens is applied in our experiments, which is a famous Web-based research recommender system. As in 1 We began pruning the tagrecommendation dataset by selecting movies that had been tagged with at least five distinct tags. We wanted to focus on tags that represented concepts applicable to multiple movies, so we required that each tag be applied to at least five movies. We iteratively repeated this pruning until we reached a stable set of movies and tags. The analysis of  pruned dataset is show in TABLE.2 TABLE.2 Analysis of Pruned Dataset Options Result total users 2851 total items 2948 tagging activities 60191 tags associated with per items 13.866 tags used by per user 7.289 tags used to annotate a item by per person 1.6459 B  Metrics For each active user u I represents the set of movies that u has tagged. Let R be the set of movies in the recommendation list The average precision is thus defined as   ui uU ui R p recision U I   6 The higher the precision, the more accuracy and better quality the recommendation   is provided by algorithm C  Results   Precision comparison between Personal View based recommendation and social view based recommendation In this experiment, we generate a top-N list of recommendations for each user. The comparing result of precision between personal view based recommendation and social view based recommendation is show in Fig.3  Fig.3 Precision comparison between Personal View based recommendation and social view based recommendation As show in Fig.3, the precision of recommendation using social view based profile is higher than personal view based profile. So the quality of recommendation is better. And the precision decreases as TopN grows. This is because user usually tags a minority of items. So as TopN increases, the items recommended contain many unpleased item. Besides social view based tag recommendation could help user find new items, as the interest topics of friends are considered   Personal view based profiles and Social view based profiles In this experiment, we select two users from dataset randomly and generate profiles based on personal view and social view separately. And the result is show in Table3.  We have mark the similar part between social view based profiles and personal view based profiles by red color. As show in Table3, user #user1 like ëSuperheroí from personal view, and from social view he may pay attention to  something like adventureí or ëactioní. From personal view, user #user2 have a interest in ëdialogueí, ëloveí and ëdramaí, ëromanceí  appear in the social view. And this similar parts or interest topics have similar meanings. All these similar parts are called frequent tag pattern, as they have a high frequency of Co-occurrence. And frequent tag patterns reflect different aspects of interest So personal view based profiles have a limit to express the user. And social view based profiles have the ability to dig the potential interest of user, also could find the similar interest.  A hybrid of them could be a more accurate way to build user profiles

The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. And as experiments show, the new user profile proposed in this paper is much more accuracy to represent the diversity of interest and the precision of recommendation is much higher.

VII  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  Subgroup discovery is referring to discovery of relations among attributes and predicted classes. This problem has been generally studied in the past with techniques enabled by statistics, datamining and human experts. It is considered as a hybrid between predictive modeling and descriptive analysis where subgroups of similar data are formed pertaining to predicting a particular target class. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for subgroup discovery by using Bayesian network. By this method, probabilities of likenesses for each relation can be explicitly calculated \(that has an advantage of white-box modeling\ and each subgroup can be represented by rules that are readily interpretable for modeling the relations We verified this method by using a small example and reasonable results are produced preliminarily. In the future, we would be working on constructi ng a software prototype that implements this new scheme. We will be putting it to work on actual datasets in large volume so that their results can be further evaluated and compared against other subgroup discovery algorithms for benchmarking. We are also working on evaluating the performance of various quality functions other than WRAcc\ for the purpose of subgroup discovery Considering the good results that Bayesian network has achieved in classification, it is believed that it can yield good results in subgroup discovery scheme as well  R EFERENCES   1  J.

The sum over the output of Equation 7 pattern P , which is used to determine the predicted classes Finally, a postprocessing filter method [12] is applied: the signals P are sorted descendingly, then all corresponding output classes are included in the multi-label up to the point of maximum decrease in the signal size from one class to the next A small modification is made in the ARTb weights, which now count label occurrences during learning by increasing their values by 1 each time the corresponding multi-label is presented. This modification leads to changes in the ARTb activation calculation of ML-FAM which is Tk = |B?W bk Another difference between the multi-label and the standard algorithms is that the former ones do not use Match Tracking with raising vigilance: The winner is simply inhibited C. Comparison of Classifiers To compare the two ART-based networks with other MLclassifiers, we chosen ML-kNN described in [8] and BoosTexter [9] which is an implementation of Boosting for the field of text categorization, based on the well-known AdaBoost algorithm [15]. ML-kNN and BoosTexter were chosen since these popular MC algorithms are nearest-neighbor- and rulebased, respectively, and therefore allow a comparison of the results of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM with algorithms based on other approaches than neural networks IV. PROXIMITY MEASURES FOR HIERARCHIES Approaches for quantitative comparison of graphs and trees are either defined on an abstract level, taking into account only the pure graph structure, or make use of the field specific semantics encoded in the graph. From the former category, we utilized the Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED  whereas Taxonomic Overlap \(TO  field of concept representation, which also deals with hierarchical structures encoded in graphs and trees. Additionally the Lowest Common Ancestor Path Distance \(LCAPD new tree distance measure, developed especially for the type of hierarchies common in HMC. A description of the mutual differences between these measures and the motivation for the development of a new metric are given at the end of this section 


A. Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED [10] is based upon the idea of transforming one hierarchy into another via certain local editing operations The distance between two hierarchies is the minimum total number of operations needed for transforming the one into the other. Three modification operations are considered: A node i is deleted by transmitting its children to its parent and removing i from the hierarchy. Inserting is the complement of deleting: Inserting i as a child of j makes i the parent of some subset of the children of j. Changing a node means changing its label. In order to make computation in polynomial time possible, the constraint that disjoint subtrees have to be mapped to disjoint subtrees is included in the definition [10], [16 The original definition does not include any normalization For two hierarchies with q labels each, 2q is the highest possible CTED  corresponding to deleting all labels of the first hierarchy and inserting all labels of the second hierarchy We normalize the CTED by 12q which results in distances in 0, 1 B. Taxonomic Overlap TO [11] compares the nodes of two hierarchies according to how many ancestors and descendants they share. We describe a version adapted to our experiments. Define semantic cotopy as SC\(i,H i j Given two hierarchies H1 and H2, the corresponding overlap for i ? L is defined as O\(i,H1, H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 Note that this is a symmetric expression in H1 and H2 with values in [0, 1]. The TO of H1 and H2 is the average of all overlaps TO\(H1, H2 1 q  i?L O\(i,H1, H2 For two identical hierarchies, TO is 1, while it is 0 if H1 and H2 are totally unrelated. Since the two other hierarchy 


proximity measures used in the experiments are distances with smaller values indicating higher similarity TO? := 1? TO to simplify comparisons C. LCA-Path Tree Distance Since in a hierarchy a parent is a more general concept than any of its children, the locations of the same label i in two hierarchies H1 and H2 can be compared by how far one has to travel up the chain of ancestors in both hierarchies until a common ancestor is found. For a label i ? L the depth dH\(i 0 dH\(i pH\(i a1, . . . , av the ancestors of i in H1, such that a1 = pH1\(i a2 = pH1\(a1 i common ancestor of i in H1 and H2, lca\(i,H1, H2 first ancestor of i in H1 which is also an ancestor of i in H2 j? := min  j | j ? {1, . . . , v} such that aj ? AH2\(i  lca\(i,H1, H2 Since 0 is an ancestor of all labels in all hierarchies, the LCA always exists. Note that usually lca\(i,H1, H2 lca\(i,H2, H1 We use the LCA to measure how far apart the positions of a label in both hierarchies are: If a label i has the same parent in both hierarchies it is regarded as being in the same position, otherwise the distances of i to its LCA in both hierarchies are used to measure how far apart both locations are. The cost for i is defined as d\(i,H1, H2 2 k=1 dHk\(i lca\(i,H1, H2 D\(i,H1, H2  0, if pH1\(i i d\(i,H1, H2 8 This can be seen as the length of the path from i to lca\(i,H1, H2 i,H1, H2 As D is not symmetric, the complete LCA-path distance

Comparison All three hierarchy proximity measures presented above reflect different concepts of tree similarity. It is thus not surprising that CTED and TO*, although they perform well in the domains they were designed for, may produce counterintuitive results when used in the field of HE. This is demonstrated by the hierarchies shown in Figure 3: Despite the fact that the relationships between the nodes in both hierarchies are completely different, their CTED and TO are 0.33 and 0.44, respectively. Their LCAPD, on the other hand, is 1.00. Thus only LCAPD marks both hierarchies with the highest possible distance Some hierarchies used in our experiments contain nodes with exactly one child \(single-child labels that TO* does not distinguish between such labels and their children, in the following sense: Given a hierarchy H and a single-child node i, we denote with H ? the hierarchy 


that is obtained from H by swapping i and its child. Then TO?\(H,H CTED or LCAPD V. EXPERIMENTS We tested the proposed data mining system with four multi-label classifiers: ML-FAM, ML-ARAM, ML-kNN and BoosTexter on three real-world datasets with increasing complexity from the text-mining field. In our experiments we compared extracted hierarchies to the original hierarchy by means of three hierarchy proximity measures: LCAPD CTED, and TO The experimental setup of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM had the following parameter values: choice parameter 0.0001; learning rates ?a,b = 1.0 for fast learning; vigilance parameters ?a = 0.9 and ?b = 1.0. The parameter t was chosen to be 0.05 for the 20 newsgroups dataset and 0.02 for the other datasets. The number of voters V was set to 9 Following [8], we used 10 nearest neighbors \(k = 10 Laplace smoothing \(s = 1 BoosTexter was trained using 500 boosting rounds as in 8] and the threshold for converting rankings into multi-labels was set to 0 [9 A. Multi-label Classification Performance Measures We used a large set of performance measures for evaluation of the MC experiments: First, two example-based measures for multi-label predictions: Accuracy \(A measure \(F  of the predicted labels are actually present while F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall calculated on the per-instance basis. The larger the A and F values, the better the MC performance Then two label-based measures were calculated on the basis of binary counts for each label: the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives We used the micro-averaged version of F1 with the binary measures counted on the whole test set. The perfect performance corresponds to F1 = 1. Additionally, micro-averaged precision and recall were used for computing the Area Under a Precision-Recall Curve \(AUPRC  precision corresponds to the proportion of predicted labels in the test set that are correct and recall to the proportion of labels that are correctly predicted. AUPRC has been claimed 


to be a well-suited performance measure for MC tasks where the number of negative instances significantly exceeds the number of positive instances [6]. Another advantage of AUPRC is its global nature and independence of a certain threshold value. The closer the AUPRC value is to 1, the better the performance Since these measures are based on the comparison of multi-labels, they depend on a transformation from rankings to classes. As a contrast we also used four wellknown ranking-based performance measures: One-Error OE RL C cision \(AP  for all ranking-based performance measures except AP. OneError evaluates how many times the top-ranked label is not in the set of proper labels of the instance. Ranking Loss is defined as the average fraction of pairs of labels that are ordered incorrectly. Coverage evaluates how far we need, on average, to go down the list of labels in order to cover all the proper labels of the instance. Average Precision evaluates the average fraction of labels ranked above a particular label i ? mt which actually are in mt And finally, the special hierarchical loss function H-loss 2] were utilized. Following [3], normalized costs were calculated: ci := 1/|c\(p\(i i ? L i of all direct children of i. Hierarchical loss \(H-loss consider mistakes made in subtrees of incorrectly predicted labels and penalizes only the first mistake along the path from the root to a node. The smaller the H-loss value, the better the performance B. 20 Newsgroups Dataset We modified the popular single-label dataset 20 Newsgroups [18], [19] by considering eight additional labels corresponding to the intermediate levels of the hierarchy faith, recreation, recreation/sport, recreation/vehicles, politics, computer, computer/hardware, science. This dataset is a collection of almost 20,000 postings from 20 newsgroups sorted by date into training \(60 40 data were preprocessed by discarding all words appearing only in the test documents and all words found in the stop word list [20]. Afterwards, all but the 2%-most-frequent words were eliminated to reduce the dimensionality. Documents were represented using the well-known TF-IDF \(Term 


Frequency  Inverse Document Frequency scheme [19]. The TF-IDF weights were then normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Conversion to TF-IDF and normalization were performed separately for training and test data. This resulted in the 1,070-dimensional dataset with 11,256 training instances, 7,493 test ones and 28 labels To test the performance of two HE algorithms, we first extracted hierarchies from the True Test Multi-Labels \(TTML and calculated the corresponding proximity measures. Both algorithms successfully extracted the original hierarchy We studied the performance of the multi-label classifiers and their ability to infer the class hierarchies in the presence of only partly available hierarchical information. We performed a series of HE experiments with multi-labels having a decreasing number of inserted non-leaf labels describing the levels in the hierarchy. We randomly removed such labels from 20%, 30%, and 40% of the training instances leaving them single-labeled. The results for predicted test multilabels are shown in Table I where the bold face marks the best classifier, and the first column \(left result of HE by Voting and the second \(right Thresholding \(referred as GT Comparing classification performance, one can see that the ART-based networks are superior to both the other classifiers in terms of most performance measures and that ML-FAM slightly outperforms ML-ARAM. Taken together they win on at least 6 and at most 8 out of 9 evaluation measures. BoosTexter has the second best performance, but its predictive power degrades more quickly with the increase in the number of single-label instances. The poorest MC results were shown by ML-kNN, its performance decreased very fast with any reduction in the number of multi-labels For example, F1 decreased by 15% while removing 40% of labels instead of 30%. It is also interesting to note that when trained on the dataset with 40% removed labels, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM significantly outperformed ML-kNN trained on the original dataset with all labels The hierarchy proximity measures confirm the good quality of predictions produced by the ART-based networks: The hierarchies were correct extracted by both HE algorithms of Section II-B even with 40% removed labels. The predictions of ML-kNN were the worst: The Voting variant of the HE 


algorithm could not extract the correct hierarchy with 30 assigning five labels incorrectly to the root label. None of the HE algorithms could extract the correct hierarchy in the absence of 40% multi-labels. With 40% and Voting, the number of labels falsely assigned to the root was 13, while with GT it was only three. For BoosTexter, Voting assigned two labels wrongly to the root label in the experiment with TABLE I 20 NEWSGROUPS ALL, -20%, -30% AND -40% RESULTS Measure all 20% 30% 40%ARAM FAM kNN BoosT.

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the

All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
