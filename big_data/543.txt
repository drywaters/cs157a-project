Performance of the GLAS Satellite Lidar Cloud and Aerosol Measurements James D Spinhirne NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Laboratory for Atmospheres/613.1 Greenbelt MD 20771 301 614 6274 james.d.spinhirne\(nasa.gov Abstract Launched in early 2003 the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System GLAS on the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite is the first polar orbiting 
satellite lidar and is intended for comprehensive earth science applications covering surface altimetry for ice sheets and vegetation and atmospheric profiling The instrument design includes high performance observations of the distribution and optical scattering cross sections of atmospheric clouds and aerosol The backscatter lidar operates at two wavelengths 532 and 1064 nm For the 
atmospheric cloud and aerosol measurements the 532 nm channel was designed for ultra high efficiency with solidstate photon counting detectors and etalon filtering Data processing algorithms were developed to calibrate and normalize the signals and produce global scale data products of the height distribution of cloud and aerosol layers and their 
optical depths and particulate scattering cross sections up to the limit of optical attenuation Since the initial production of data products there has been extensive studies of the accuracy and limitation of the data products Studies include the statistical analysis of results quality checking surveys and inter-comparison to ground and airborne measurements The 
paper concentrates on the effectiveness results and limitations of the atmospheric lidar channel design and data product algorithms Overall given known instrument problems uncorrected before launch the results validate the expectations of the lidar design 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 INSTRUMENT 2 3 REQUIREMENTS AND DATA

lidar was initiated in 2003 by the launch of the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System GLAS shown in Figure 1 Measurements have now provided fundamentally new results We concern ourselves here with atmospheric applications on the global distribution of clouds and aerosol in this paper 1 More generally GLAS was developed as a 
comprehensive earth sensing lidar for both surface and atmospheric applications 2 The surface measurements have shown some significant results 3 Figure 1 GLAS instrument on satellite The primary advance from the active optical sensing of the atmosphere is an unambiguously accurate and highly resolved measurement of the distribution for atmospheric 1 


scattering layers In addition the lidar data provides an extremely sensitive detection of the thinnest aerosol and cloud layers and their optical thickness For clouds the initial analyzed results for GLAS show the total global cloud cover is 7600 over 1500 higher than accepted amounts and cloud overlap defined as the detection of a second cloud layer before full optical attenuation is found to be present in 400O of cloudy areas globally a fundamentally new observation If an optically opaque atmosphere is defined as a lack of a laser signal from the surface then GLAS finds a surprising 4900 of the global atmosphere to be optically opaque The global pattern of retrieved cloud altitude is significantly different than results from passive sensors 4 Cloud distribution and coverage in Polar regions is an especially important application 5 Passive retrievals do not fare well underlain with bright low temperature surfaces Coverage is also best in polar latitudes with representative sampling on a daily basis as indicated in Figure 2 Figure 2 Depiction of one day of GLAS measurements over Antarctica The measurements give a very accurate detection and height profile of all significant clouds and aerosol layers in the atmosphere but the coverage is limited to nadir only profiling For atmospheric aerosol GLAS observations represent the first global measurements of the true height distribution In addition lidar gives a much more sensitive detection of aerosol layers than passive sensors and is not biased by land background Data are analyzed for aerosol optical depth and extinction cross section with special retrieval methods Values obtained have an advantage for accurate measurements of low optical depth Some results for GLAS aerosol measurements have already been reported From interpretation of the aerosol height distribution a unique global data product of PBL height is produced The PBL planetary boundary layer height data have been applied as a new validation for the ECMWF and other global circulation models 6 Data have also been used to determine the faction of the global atmosphere that is clear 7 Defining clear as aerosol and cloud optical depths of less than 0.01 this initial analysis of GLAS data shows 20 of the global atmosphere as clear Hart et al 8 show how data define the height distribution between aerosol and cloud in the PBL The initial full operation of GLAS began in fall of 2003 and the initial data products as reported in the papers mentioned above were released in 2004 Since that time there has been an ongoing process of analyzing results and improvement in the quality and comprehensiveness of measurements and products such as occurs for all satellite missions Studies include the statistical analysis of results quality-checking surveys inter-comparison of algorithms and comparison to ground and airborne measurements Before launch there were well-defined science requirements that the measurements and algorithms were to accomplish A question is how well were these goals realized This paper describes the effectiveness results and limitations of the lidar channel design and data product algorithms to the current time Instrument problems especially laser reliability have affected the quality and length of all GLAS observations The GLAS data are currently limited to less than two years but high quality data to three months Nerveless the global measurements for even this time period represent a significant new result for aerosol radiation and global change research Unique characteristics of the GLAS instrument leave many of the measurements and results to be unique for the foreseeable future and their quality and accuracy a mater of importance 2 INSTRUMENT GLAS is a nadir viewing laser

This figure presents the data flow through main blocks that can be used a few times and special blocks that must execute only particular functions Here also Configurator of chain and Sequences library for WiMAX/UMTS modules are equipped First one is responsible for right construction of next processing path and second one stores necessary number of elements After signal verification system is reconfigured according to input data and with using the chosen protocol type The OUTPUT connects to radio link and then signal must be transmitted over one of six channel types And at the reception side we configure the receiver in relation to transmitted mode 5 HARDWARE PLATFORM SELECTION Current technologies in a hardware environment allow to test our system in real-time implementation There are a couple of DSP based platforms that can be selected for validation from Lyrtech Inc the Small Form Factor SFF Software Communication Architecture SCA Development the Small Form Factor SFF Softwaredefined Radio SDR Development Platform the Small Form Factor SFF Software-defined Radio SDR Evaluation Module 20 All these platforms are based on TMS320DM6446 DMP SoC from Texas Instruments 21 For the proposed SDR based system we chose the SFFSDR Evaluation board see Figure 13 as far as this platform supports WiMAX technology model based design tools accelerating prototyping implementation of all protocols layers for complete radio stacking extra boards operates with 297MHz ARM926EJ-s RISC CPU and 594MHz C64x DSP in sense of power management this module has MSP430 MCU Due to an availability of Virtex-4 SX35 FPGA from Xilinx 22 this module can perform implementation of full modem processing functions that is very important feature in meaning of multi-protocol architecture of our system We are able to vary our requirements to each protocol inside the same hardware structure Figure 13 SFF SDR development platform by Lyrtech 6 PROTOTYPING THE WiMAX/UMTS SYSTEM The WiMAX/UMTS system is implemented in high-level language as C with the class library The main accent was done on the correct form of the signal processing sequence The path for WiMAX or UMTS signal is determined in the beginning and system should verify its entity leads the system in a relevant direction The main goal of this software implementation is to check how our system can handle the input signal sequence The simulation was carried out for following parameters for each subsystem For UMTS we consider transport block with 1280 bits size frame size is 2400 bits channelization code with 16 chips sequence For WiMAX we generate the bit block is equal to 1280 bits however during channel coding operation this block is divided on turbo coding block that include 384 bits The size of turbo coding block forms from the block determination corresponding modulation type and number of subchannels During software verification we obtained that our proposed model can separate different paths subject to a type of an inter sequence in the software environment The framework of our WiMAX/UMTS system went through one scenario step and now we are directed to an extension of this model For the more detailed system visualization we integrate our C code modules into MATLAB library by means of proper dynamic linking libraries dll compiled by using the MATLAB C compiler Each block can be formed with extended parameters Modules with C code configurate the system work in a host This host implementation will present a prototype This prototype will help to analyze future real-time hardware implementation MATLAB prototype can also provide debugging of real system the result of real system must be equal to our MATLAB prototype Next step of the work development and verification is to implement it into the hardware platform based on DSP DSP based platform allows to organize signal processing in a digital presentation that serves SDR based part of our general system 7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we considered the framework of WiMAX/UMTS baseband level system for mobile device in UL transmission direction We presented the different signal processing structures based on OFDM and WCDMA physical layer procedures Our research work is mainly devoted to developing the approach of seamless switching between different subsystems that can be realized by SDR technology implementation To this end we proposed a possible solution to allow coexistence of different data transmission technologies 11
