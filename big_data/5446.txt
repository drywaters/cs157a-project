1515  The current pricing adjustment mechanism for refined oil in China is adjusted by the National Development and Reform Commission in accordance with the prices of New Yo rk, Singapore and Rotterdam therefore, the oil price in China is mainly impacted by the three places\222 oil prices, including the WTI Crude oil futures, which is one of the three crude oil benchmarks in New York Mercantile Exchange. Our experiment will give some proofs about this After preprocessing \(the of WTI is 0.2, SHFE is 2 time window width is 3\we have 601 instances. We set the min_sup and min_conf as 0.05 and 0.70, and discover 15 time series asso ciation rules. See in Fig.7 The first time series association rule found is 1:SHFE:up,1:WTI:down,2:SHFE:down,2:WTI:up 3:SHFE:up[support=6.32%,confidence=84  This rule indicates that if SHFE fuel oil futures price is up and WTI Crude o il futures price is down on the first day, and on the second day SHFE is down and WTI is up, then on the third day SHFE is up\222s support is 6.32%, confidence is 84.4%. We can also find that all the latter cases in the rules found are about SHFE, that means the SHFE fuel oil futures price has a strong correlation with the WTI Crude oil futures price For comparison, we conduct another experiment using the same data set in Weka data mining software which is developed by Waikato University, the results are show in Fig.8. Check these rules, such as \223101 2=WTI:up 3=SHFE:down 3=WTI:down 47 2=SHFE:up 33    conf:\(0.7\\224\(where 47 is support count of items contained in the former case, 33 is the whole rules\222 items support count\his rule predicts the second day\222s trend by the incident of the third day, it\222s not practical, hence this rule is redundant. Out of the 101 rules found by Weka, we can find 15 rules useful the same as in our system     This shows that our Time Series Association Rules Mining System based on TB-SCM algorithm is more effective, it can generate tim e series association rules without redundancy  4 Summary and future work  This paper presented a novel association rules mining algorithm TB-SCM for mining futures prices time series association rules, it\222s more effective than the classical Apriori, and can generate the aimed rules without redundancy  Futures market has not only a large amount of data but also a considerable number of real-time data opportunities are fleeting, how to timely discover the relevant rules, and how to find the new rules without re-mining the whole data set when data is updated is of great importance. Therefore, the next step of our research work is to realize the dynamic updates and incremental association rules mining  Fig.7 Results

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
