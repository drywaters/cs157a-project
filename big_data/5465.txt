Shanghai,China dmhuang@shou.edu.cn Abstract 002 Data mining basing on Privacy preservation has become a research hot point now. Web usage mining is one kind of data mining applications, and how to prevent data leakiness in web usage mining is also an important issue. In this paper, we present an effective method for privacy preserving association rule mining in the web usage mining, Secondary Random Response Column Replacement \(SRRCR\ to improve the privacy preservation and mining accuracy. Then, a privacy preserving association rule mining algorithm based on 
SRRCR is presented, which can achieve significant improvements in terms of privacy and efficiency Finally, we present experimental results that validate the algorithms by applying it on real datasets Keywords: web usage mining; privacy preservation randomized response; association rules I  I NTRODUCTION  With the continuous development of data mining technology, its appliance is more and more widely Web data mining is an application hot point of data mining in recent years. The fast development of web makes itself to be the world's largest public 
data source, Web data mining is based on public data sources, but there are also privacy leakiness problem. For example, on e-commerce site, all records of customers visited the website are stored in Web server log without reservation. These records reflect the consumers‘ buying habits and purchasing powers 002 but the customers do not want these data to be disclosed, so privacy protection should also be considered in the web data mining Privacy preserving association rule mining is to discover the frequent itemsets as accurately as possible and generate the minimum support and 
confidence by accessing the original transaction sets of conditions. There is a contradiction between data privacy and data accuracy. At present, the privacy protection of data mining methods can be divided into data perturbation [1-3 d qu er y  restriction [4-5 200 2, S  J R i zv i an d J. R   Haritsa presented a representative association rules mining method, MASK \(Mining Associations with Secrecy Konstraints h at  i s a dat a pert u r bat i on strategies. Because Warner model in statistics is used in MASK, all the data transformed have the directly relations with the real raw data, which makes the preserving less than satisfactory, and the 
selection of randomized parameters should deviate from 0.5  6 o t h e r li m itati o n  In this paper, we give the general framework for mining association rules in the web usage mining and use a user-oriented and time-oriented session explore method to generate sequence sets firstly Then we propose a method to transform user session information into a relational data table, and perturb data by using Secondary Random Response Column Replacement \(SRRCR\lgorithm. Based on the pseudorandom data set, frequent itemsets and strong association rules discovery algorithm 
are presented II  T HE GENERAL FRAMEWORK  As e-commerce, Web services and Web-based information system‘s sustainable development and growth, there are a large number of user data collected in web organizations. The principal data sources in web usage mining are web server log files, and other Data sources including the web site files and metadata, operational databases application templates and domain knowledge. In order to solve privacy preservation issues of web usage mining, we proposed Secondary Random Response Column Replacement 
 SRRCR algorithm, and a privacy protection association rule mining methods based on it. The overall structure and framework shown as follow Fig.1.The frameworks were divided into 2 stages: data preprocessing stage and privacy preserving mining stage. The data preprocessing stage preprocessing the data by five steps and generate the session translate table. The privacy preserving stage is the key stage including the privacy preservation methods and association rule application

For the purposes of analysis, these data need to be converted and aggregated in the  different levels. In web usage mining, the page is the basic level of data extraction and the session is the basic action in the data extraction for users T ABLE 1  O RIGINAL SESSION SAMPLE  ID IP URL Time 1 2.3.4.5 Page1 0:01 2 2.3.4.5 Page2 0:05 3 2.3.4.5 Page4 0:16 4 3.4.5.6 Page1 0:10 5 3.4.5.6 Page3 0:12 6 3.4.5.6 Page4 0:15 7 3.4.5.6 Page5 0:19 8 5.6.7.8 Page2 0:11 9 5.6.7.8 Page5 0:13 10 9.6.7.8 Page2 0:11 11 9.6.7.8 Page4 0:17 12 5.6.7.9 Page1 0:15 13 5.6.7.9 Page3 0:19 14 5.6.7.9 Page5 0:25 Table1 shows a sample of user’s original session In the table each row represents a user session identified by using uniquely ID , and IP represents the user's IP address, where different addresses for different users. URL means the page accessed by users in the session. The ideal method of user path restoring can reconstruct the real process of user session. Here we use time-oriented user sessions explore method Let the vector M 003\027 M 1 002 M 2 002  002 M i 002  002 M N 003\031 represent the log data set, where M i  003\027 IP i 002 URL i 002 Date i 002 Time i Method i Code i Bytes i 003\031  and N is the number of log files.

where we store the IP address, session ID, and the visits of each page in a two-dimensional table. The value of Pi column means whether the user visits the page and buys the products or not .in the column 1 means an access to the page and 0 means no access to the page The algorithm 2 is described below; it transfers the user activity records into the relation twodimensional table that can be handled easy Algorithm 2 Input: user session set S Output:  two-dimensional user session table S_table Create table S_table 002 TID,IP,SESSIONID,P i 002  For each  S i of  S Insert into S_table\(IPID,SID\values \(IP i SID i  If 002 P i of  S i  Insert into S_table 002 P i 002 Values\(‘1 else Insert into S_table 002 P i 002 Values\(‘0 Endfor Each session will be seen as a transaction, the customer's session sequence can be converted to relational tables where the page numbers represent the corresponding purchase action. We added a new field TID in the table 3, which is the identity column and can be assigned values automatically by the system Table3 2D table saving the user session path TID IPID SID P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 10001 2.3.4.5 1 1 1 0 1 0 10002 3.4.5.6 2 1 0 1 1 1 10003 5.6.7.8 3 0 0 0 0 1 10004 9.6.7.8 4 0 1 1 1 0 10005 5.6.7.9 5 1 1 0 1 1 D  Privacy Protection Algorithm In the two-dimensional table the columns which need to privacy protected are P1, P2 and P3, P4 and P5, those columns are known as sensitive attributes in the privacy protection technology h e attribute values itself are not to disclose privacy, but the attribute group will leak customers privacy information. Therefore we protect the sensitive attributes by using the improved randomized response method. In order to improve the efficiency of data preservation, we randomize the value twice at a certain probability, and this algorithm is named the secondary random response column replacement algorithm \(SRRCR\. Specific methods are as follows Set random parameter I 1    0 4 3 2 1 004 004 p p p p and 1 4 3 2 1     p p p p  Set random parameter II 1 r  r  r  r 0 4 3 2 1 004 004 and 1 r r r r 4 3 2 1     002  Create randomization function R \(x\e original column C \(i, j\ is transformed to hiding column F \(i j\, where F\(i,j 003 0,1},C\(i,j 003 0,1 For x= F\(i,j 003 0,1}, random function convention is  as follows T ABLE 4  C ONVENTION OF RANDOM FUNCTION   p 1 p 2  p 3  P 4  x x 0 1 y  r 1 r 2  r 3  r 4  y x 0 1 null Let i is an item , where 002 is the support of i in C 002 null is the support of null in C 002\034 is the support of i in F.  The transaction T of C is converted by SRRCR process to the transaction T 001 of F, and then there is 4 4 null r  p  005 1 3 4 3 1 4 1    r p p r p p     K K 006 005 2 By  the  \(1\d  \(2 007 010 007 011 005 005 005 005 006 012  012  012  012  1 3 null 4 1 1 4 3 null 3 r r r r p p p p 3 Here 011  4 3 r r is the top coefficient 010  4 1 r r is the bottom coefficient 002 and 007  null 005 is the support of null value.We can see that the benefit of the algorithm is the introduction of the adjustable factors to calculate of the support. In t the actual perturbation process, we can use a null value to further enhance privacy preservation T ABLE 5  P ROBABILITIES OF DATA MAPPING BY SRRCR METHOD  Assuming that support threshold is 0.4 in the M and choosing p 1 0.2,p 2 0.2,p 3 0.1,p 4 0.5, while select r 1 0.3,r 2 0.2,r 3 0.2,r 4 0.3 031 according to SRRCR algorithm customer session set is converted as  table6

T ABLE 6  F AKE COLUMN DATA SET GENERATION AND F INAL FAKE COLUMN DATA SET    After conversion algorithm SRRCR, fake sets include not only the value of 0 and 1, also null value. The meaning of Null can be defined by the user Mining association rules can take into account the column of null value and  the support of itemset i in fake set after converted from SRRCR algorithm can matches the support of j in the original transaction set IV  P RIVACY PRESERVING ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM  Apriori algorithm is an influential algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and Boolean association rules. Based on the Apriori Algorithm [9 w e  presented an improved algorithm to achieve association rule mining for fake transaction sets converted by SRRCR. Given the minsup and data set, main implementation actions of the algorithm are described as follows Algorithm 4. Progressive scan association rule mining algorithm 1  Setting frequent itemsets 013 and 013 is collection of  itemset M n whose item number is n 002 where n 000  k 1 i i k C 002 and k is the maximum number transactions 2.

Using Apriori pruning  principle in the process of match the itemset in the row data. Algorithm first match 1-itemset, then 2- itemset, 3-itemset ….to reduces the computer load 4. Circulation in turn 002 when the ratio of the number in k- itemset of the searched rows to the numbers of all rows has reached the minimum support of k itemset, stop this k-itemset match process .If  the ratio o f the number n in k- itemset of the searched rows to the numbers of all rows m has not reached the minimum support of k- itemset, only reached the number of x , when n/m> minsup , algorithm calculate r=\(\(n-m\x\/m, if r> minsup, continues circulating, else stop this itemset search 5. Getting all the frequent itemsets which satisfy the minsup Processing of Algorithm is described below Input: itemset D 001 after conversion algorithm SRRCR, minimum support threshold s Output: frequent itemset F of real dataset D Set 013  013 M 1 M 2 M n L 1 L 2 L k L 1 L 2  L 1 L k he full itemset for \(i=n; i>0 002 i--\  ,and n 000  k 1 i i k C  set A i index\(i\e searching matrix matching 013 i for each transaction t 003 D 001 scan each row R i C i A i  if 002 R i 014 0, then // exit matched row if i=n  //counting every item calculate template 002 c.count= c.count 0 1 , c.count 1 c.count 1 1 c.count n c.count n 1 002  else select_add\( c.count\unction select_add endif endif endfor F k LI LG sup min   015 003 016 n count c C c k  endfor return F k k k F U 016  Function select_add is to count each itemset after pruning \(ki\ , that is c  count  c  count 0 1  c  count 1  c  count 1 1…. c  count n  c  count n 1 In the counting process, algorithm prune the frequent itemsets generated \(Pruning methods is in Apriori principle no explanation After obtained frequent itemsets, based on the support and confidence formula below, data providers can find the assoication rules of web log item Support \(A 000 B\upport_count \(AUB all_count V  P ERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  A  Algorithm Complexity Analysis Theoretically, Apriori algorithm is an exponential algorithm. let N be the size of transaction, each transaction includes n items averagely, and then the whole itemset space will reach 017 002 2 n 002 The mining algorithm we have improved, when k <1-2 1-minsup\, the itemset corresponds with the position of the value in sequence 013 does not match the minimum support, the last calculations for this itemset will be given up.

The transact  number  is 1000, the item number is 11, and the ATL \(the average transaction length\ 2.8. We analyzed the privacy protection with minimum support of 3 and the following table shows the privacy protection intensity of the minimum support of 3 with different values of randomized algorithm parameters for different T ABLE 7  I NTENSITY OF PRIVACY PROTECTION   The Fig.2 shows the average itemset error of SRRCR method and MASK method, and states the relationships between the random parameter, the data privacy intensity and the accuracy of mining results  Fig. 2 Average itemsets error of SRRCR method and MASK method As can be seen, MASK method has wide error by comparison. When the P is close to 0 or 1, the mining results is more accurate, but the intensity of privacy protection is poor. When the value of P gradually approaches 0.5, privacy protection intensity has been improved, but the accuracy of mining results will be significantly decreased. Error changes of the method SRRCR proposed in this paper is relatively stable, according to the P value that is, when the proportion of real data vary from 0 to 1, the privacy damage coefficient will increased from 0 to 1 simultaneously, so it lead to the decrease of the intensity of privacy protection, and continuously improve the accuracy of mining results VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Privacy preserving in web data mining has arisen worldwide concerns with the promotion of network technology and the demand of application. But there are many drawbacks and open questions In this paper, we have presented a method for privacy preserving mining of association rules based on web usage mining. First, we gave the general framework for mining association rules in the web usage mining, generated session sets by exploring user sessions and transfer session sets to relation two-dimension table. Second, we proposed secondary random response column replacement SRRCR\, a simple and effective privacy preserving algorithm, and achieve privacy protection association rule mining based on SRRCR. Finally we presented experimental results that validated the algorithm \(SRRCR\ in practice by simulation In the future, we will enhance the efficiency of mining algorithm further by parallelization and other methods, and combine  SRRCR with other privacy preserving ways to achieve more significant improvements in terms of privacy, accuracy efficiency, and applicability A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The study is funded by key project of Shanghai Scientific Committee, subject number 08dz1204802 R EFERENCES  1  Rizvi SJ, Haritsa JR.

classi“er in order to identify the nature of the request normal or abnormal based on the normal usage pro“le maintained previously Since we used a passive anomaly detector in terms of response action the result of the classi“cation is recorded in the anomaly log database using the ResponseM anager module V R ELATED W ORK A paradigmatic example for how to do host-based IDSs approach is presented in If the system call traces of normal applications are self-similar then it is straightforward to build an IDS that allows to learn the normal behavior of applications and recognizes possible attacks by looking for abnormalities For learning the IDS gathers system call traces from times when the system is not under attack extracts all sub-traces containing consecutive system calls and creates a database of these observed sub-traces which in turn are deemed anomalous if it does not appear within the database In the monitoring the abnormality of a new system call trace is measured by counting how many anomalous sub-traces it contains A process mining framework that utilizes the concept of clinical pathways to facilitate the automatic and systematic construction of an adaptable and extensible detection model is presented in The authors took a data-centric point of view and considered healthcare fraud and abuse detection as a data analysis process This automatic approach eliminates the need to manually analyze and encode behavior patterns as well as the guesswork in selecting statistics measures The proposed framework was evaluated via real-world data to demonstrate its ef“ciency and accuracy In the authors presented a more-rob ust anomaly detection IDS using data mining techniques The techniques are designed to dynamically model what a normal network should look like at the same time aimed to reduce the false positive and false negative alarm rates in the process Moreover the authors used classi“cation-tree techniques to accurately predict probable attack sessions Overall their goal is to model network traf“c into network sessions and identify those network sessions that have a high-probability of being an attack Various work have been going on mining audit data for IDSs In this area the work closest in spirit to ours can be found in where the authors describes a n o v e l framework name MADAM ID for mining audit data in order to construct models automatically for the intrusion detection The framework compute activity patterns from system audit data and extracts predictive features from the patterns It then applies machine learning algorithms to the audit records that are processed according to the feature de“nitions to generate detection rules Past results on the DARPA ID Evaluation showed that their ID model was one of the best performing of all the participating systems The related works described also several other works in IDSs use several techniques such as machine learning state-machine abstraction process mining and even data mining Our work is not aimed at advancing such approaches Rather it tailors host-based anomaly modeling and detection technique to pervasive healthcare systems and the use of data mining is traced back to the beauty of data mining techniques in extracting patterns from large dataset In this regard pervasive healthcare systems are immediate candidates for data intensive domain We also pointed out that there is lack of tool-support for anomaly-based intrusion detection of pervasive healthcare systems To this end the anomaly detection model and the prototype implementation could help as springboard for the attempt in alleviating tool-support for intrusion detection of pervasive healthcare systems VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we described constructing anomaly detection model based on data mining techniques in a medical pervasive environment for legitimate users Due to the sensitiveness of medical records it must protect medical records both from outsiders and insiders who try to abuse their privileges What we can conclude from this work is that maintaining user activity information for intrusion detection can enhance the role played by the proposed model in protecting a pervasive healthcare system from insider attacks Moreover we demonstrated the algorithmic detail showing the way to accomplish this through maintaining associations between selected attributes to represent normalcy which is required for classi“cation purpose Finally we described the prototype implementation of the proposed model and discussed the results of evaluation Even though we proved that the algorithms devised in the anomaly detection work in practice the evaluation of algorithmic ef“ciency issues are left as future work The rules generated from a limited number of dataset are very large in number In order to identify an activity as anomalous the data structures used to maintain the rules resides in memory Consequently the speed of the classi“er is boosted at a cost of more memory consumption Another line of future work is to monitor a larger data set to determine the ef“ciency pattern as the data set size get larger As described in the proposed anomaly detection model we only used the association rule and classi“cation based on association techniques Nevertheless for better detection capabilities it is also advisable to include the sequence

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
