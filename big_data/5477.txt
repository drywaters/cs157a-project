create every activity icon and decide which atomic service it should be assigned to. In fact, when constructing BPEL processes in a specific business domain, the number of the atomic services is finite, and maybe there is causality between some of these services. If we can dig out the association relationship between these atomic services, then we can provide some activity recommendation information to the developers to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the BPEL documentation\222s compilation. Also, this kind of association relationship can be used to build the template of BPEL subprocesses.

Association rule is one of the mining technology of data mining, and it is used for finding out related itemsets from large numbers of transactions. A typical application is, from abundant shopping basket records, to discover the fact that the consumers have the custom of buying diapers and beer at the same time, thus we get a rule like diapers beer. The definitions of association rules are as follows 1  itemset The set of items. We suppose 
 represents the set of all items 2  K-itemset The itemset which contains K items

B  Microsoft_Association_Rules In this paper, the algorithm that the experiment used is Microsoft_Association_Rules Algorithm. It is an improvement and optimization of Apriori Algorithm and saves the memory space by using the data structure of tree Microsoft_Association_Rules Algorithm has two main steps: mining the frequent itemsets and generating rules based on the frequent itemsets, which are explained below 1  Mining the frequent itemsets This step uses an iterative method, this means that itemsets\(K\ is used for exploring itemsets\(K+1\ Firstly, by scanning the database, count on each item, collect all the items satisfying MIN_SUPPORT, and call the set of these items as 1 L Then 1 L is used for seeking 2 L and 2 L is used for seeking 3 L and so forth , finally we stop at frequent itemsets\(K\ if there is no frequent itemsets\(K+1\atisfying MIN_SUPPORT 2  Generating rules based on the frequent itemsets For each frequent itemset f generate all the subset x and its complementary set x f y   if CONFIDENCE MIN y x confidence _     then y x is a qualified strong association rule IV  BPEL  M ODELING AND T RANSACTIONS C REATION  In essential, BPEL is a business process, and it describes the business process procedure in a specific domain. Because of this specialty, we can model the BPEL process, extract all the interesting activities and arrange them in the original logical order in BPEL process to build a LAT. Then, we get all the LASeqs\(Longest Activity Sequence\by tranversing from the root to the leaves of LAT. Finally, by introducing the notion of sliding window, we transform LASeqs to the input transactions of association rules: sub-activity sequences A  The Mapping of  Base Activity Since what we will excavate is the inner relationship between the activities, and what we concern is the causality between the atomic services BPEL activity invokes, we only show our interest on three types of base activities receive  reply and invoke For briefness, activity is represented as ActivityType_ActivityName, ActivityType is the type of the activity, having     pe ActivityTy INV RPL RCV  in which RCV, RPL and INV are the abbreviations of receive  reply and invoke respectively. ActivityName is the name of the activity, which is uniquely identified by partnerLink  portType  and operation The mapping of the base activities of BPEL process is shown in TABLE1 TABLE I  THE MAPPING OF BASE ACTIVITIES OF BPEL PROCESS  The Base Activities of BPEL Process Mapped as receive partnerLink= ìaî operation= ìb portType= ìcî variable RCV_abc invoke partnerLink= ìaî operation= ìb INV_abc portType= ìcî inputVariable=Ö outputVariable assign\\faultHandlers\\eventHandlers wait\\empty\\scope\\process\\terminate null B  The Mapping of Structured Activity For the structured activities in BPEL sequence, if/else while  flow their mapping mode is shown in Fig. 1 For the activity forEach and repeatUntil their mapping mode is the same as while Because we just care about the association relation between the activities, activityís repeat times will be ignored, and the activities in the circular structure will be mapped only once   Figure 1  The Mapping Mode Of  Structured Activities Of  BPEL Process C  Constructing Labeled Activity Tree Mapping the base activities in BPEL to nodes, structured activities to connecting lines, in which sequence  while  forEach  repeatUntil are mapped as the lines connecting contained activities orderly if/else and flow are mapped as the lines connecting contained activities parallelly, then an activity tree\(AT\ is built. Labeling the nodes in AT will get LAT. The method of labeling is: each node in AT is labeled using a pair m, n\, m denotes the level this node lies in AT, and n denotes this node is the nth node in level m. A labeled activity is expressed as Triple=\(ActivityType_ActivityName, m, n\. Fig 2 is an example of a LAT  Figure 2  An example of a Labeled Activity Tree D  Activity Sequence after Introducing Sliding window After constructing LAT, the next step is to find out all the LASeqs in LAT. LASeq is a path from the root to a leaf of LAT. It is worth noting that, because of the existence of flow  


and if/else there is some difference between LAT and general multi-tree, that is, two branches in LAT have the possibility to converge later on. Actually, the number of LASeqs is equal to or larger than the number of leaves in a LAT. The pseudocode of obtaining all the LASeqs is as below 1  Symbol Definition   root root node of LAT   Seq activity sequence   tailOfSeq\(Seq the last node in Seq   children\(node the set of all the direct children of node   countOfChildren\(node the number of the direct children of node   add\(Seq  node add node to the tail of  Seq   add\(S, Seq add Seq to the set S   remove\(S, Seq remove Seq from set S   newSeq =copy\(Seq copy Seq as a new sequence namely, newSeq 2  Algorithm of Creating LASeqs\(ACL  Input a LAT Output all the LASeqs of this LAT Algorithm \(ACL S return  19    i Seq remove\(S  0 if\(j   18   j   17  childNode  add\(newSeq   16  i  copy\(Seq newSeq   15   ailNode children\(t childNode each for   14 0 j   13 true flag  0 unt if\(childCo   12 Node ldren\(tail countOfChi childCount   11  i Seq tailOfSeq de tailNo  10   i Seq  sequence each for  9 false flag  8 true flag while 7 Seq  add\(S  6 root  add\(Seq  5  Seq   4 true flag boolean  3  childCount  j int  2 childNode tailNode root  Node  1 j j j j                   S S  The result of ACL should guarantee that all the LASeqs are not the same. Two LASeqs are the same implies that these two LASeqs have the same length and the corresponding activity nodes \(expressed as Triple\ the same. In the LAT in Fig. 2 there are two LASeqs in all LASeq1 Activity1,1,1\\(Activity2,2,1\\(Activity3,3,1\\(Activity5,4,1 Activity6,5,1 LASeq2 Activity1,1,1\\(Activity2,2,1\\(Activity4,3,2\\(Activity5,4,1 Activity6,5,1 However, there is only one leaf node: Activity 6 3  Introducing Sliding window In order to get the input transactions of association rules mining, the notion of sliding window is introduced. Sliding window glides on LASeq from the beginning to the end, one activity at a time, thereout some subASeqs are gotten. The size of the sliding window is decided by the number of related activities we are interested with. Still take Fig. 2 as an example if we want to get the association relation between two activities, i.e. activity B always appears after A on condition that they have some inner causality, in this case, the size of the sliding window should be set to 2 After introducing sliding window with size 2\(Fig.3 LASeq1 produces four subASeqs Activity1,1,1\\(Activity2,2,1\,\(Activity2,2,1\ \(Activity3,3,1 Activity3,3,1\ \(Activity5,4,1\,\(Activity5,4,1\\(Activity6,5,1 In like manner, LASeq2 also produces four subASeqs Activity1,1,1\\(Activity2,2,1\,\(Activity2,2,1\ \(Activity4,3,2 Activity4,3,2\ \(Activity5,4,1\,\(Activity5,4,1\\(Activity6,5,1 Finally, the LAT in Fig. 2 has eight subASeqs in all Collect all the subASeqs of all the BPEL processes in a specific business domain, and keep only the first term ActivityType_ActivityName\ every activityís Triple, we will get all the input transactions for the association rules mining  Figure 3  LASeq1  after Introducing Sliding Window with Size 2 V  E XPERIMENT R ESULT AND ANALYSIS  The experiment data source from a multimedia conference system in the authorís laboratory. It contains 19 BPEL processes with 63 interesting activities after mapping. The tool

The algorithm parameters of mining model are MIN_SUPPORT = 0.035 MIN_PROBABILITY \(viz. MIN_CONFIDENCE\ = 0.4 Here we illustrate the modeling of a BPEL process in conference system \(Fig.5\. After the neglection of scope\\assign\\eventHandlers the LAT is shown in Fig. 6  Figure 5  A BPEL process in Multimedia Conference System   Figure 6  LAT of BPEL process in Fig.5 The mining result is shown in Fig.4, four rules are obtained, and they are consistent with the conference logic Rule1 indicates that, after conference BPEL processís invoking getMedia  setMedia is always invoked in succession getMedia is used for querying a participantís supported media condition, and setMedia is used for setting new media condition for the participant. In fact, before the ìsetting queryingî is necessary, in order to avoid the mistake that a participant has no camera but is required to receive conference video. Rule2 is also reasonable, because the function of getConfInfo is to get conference chairmanís ID, which is an indispensable parameter to invoke the immediate inf orm Chairman  Thus, during the procedure of constructing a BPEL process, when the developer creates an activity IVK_getMedia  we can recommend IVK_setMedia to him/her, this is helpful in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of BPEL documentís compilation VI  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  The method in this paper mines out those highly related activities, which are internally tightly-coupled and can be applied in the creation of BPEL template and subprocess in the subsequent work. In addition, some BPEL base activities mappings are ignored here, and they can be added to be considered in future research R EFERENCES  1  Oasis, ìBusiness process execution language \(bpel\î, v1.1 and v2.0 URL: http://www.oasis-open.org, 2007 2  Bao Liang ,Song Shengli ,Chen Sheng , Chen Ping , Hu Shengming and Cui Weiyong, ìResearch on static process slicing in BPELî, Systems Engineering and Electronics, vol .31, No. 1, January 2009 3  Zhai Yanlong, Su Hongyi, Zhang Han and Zhan Shouyi, ìThe method of segmenting BPEL process based on data stream optimization Journal of South China University of Technology \(Natural Science Edition\, vol.37, No.4, April 2009 4  Deng Min, Deng Na, Peng Yong and Cheng Bo, ìThe algorithm of subprocess discovery for BPEL process based on variable dependence Proceedings of 2010 International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing \(CMC 2010\ 2010, in press 5  Deng Na and Deng Fang, ìResearch of a mining method about multidimensional inter-time association rule based on sliding window Proceedings of China-Ireland International Conference on Information and Communications Technologies \(CIICT 2008\, p.419ñ422,2008 6  ZhaoHui Tang and Jamie MacLennan, ìData Mining with SQL Server2005î, Tsinghua University Press, January 2007 7  Han Jiawei and Kamber M. ìData Mining: Concepts and Techniques China Machine Press , March 2007

problem of generalized association rules was 002rstly introduced in Gi v en a dataset where each transaction is a set of items and a taxonomy de\002ned on the items generalized association rule mining consists in 002nding associations between items at any level of the taxonomy Proposed algorithms generate generalized itemsets by considering for each item its parents in the hierarchy Hence candidate frequent itemsets are exhaustively generated by producing a large amount of unnecessary item combinations One step towards a more ef\002cient extraction process for generalized itemset extraction have been proposed in  12 14 7 002rstly proposes a top-do wn hierarch y traversal based on the Apriori principle to ef\002ciently identify infrequent itemsets When a more general term is infrequent its descendants are ignored during the candidate generation However appopriate support thresholds have to be enforced to properly handle different data granularity in the taxonomy A more ef\002cient approach based on the FP-tree structure has been proposed in 12 First the FP-tree containing all frequent multiple-level items is built Then frequent generalized itemsets are generated by using a divide-an-conquer strategy as in FP-growth algorithm An ancestor list for the items belonging to the currently mined itemset is exploited to ef\002ciently prune itemsets containing both an item and its ancestor All the state-of-the-art approaches perform a similar exhaustive taxonomy evaluation by extracting most of all possible itemsets at all levels of abstraction A huge amount of itemsets is mined and valuable pattern discovery is often left as post-processing step limiting support threshold enforcement effectiveness G EN IO aims at overcoming such an issue by performing an opportunistic extraction of generalized itemsets It exploits a user provided taxonomy to drive the pruning phase of the extraction process Instead of extracting itemsets for all levels of the taxonomy and post-pruning them the proposed generalization technique over the taxonomy is support driven i.e it generalizes an itemset only if it is below the support threshold Thus G EN IO automatically performs generalization only when needed A preliminary version of the G EN IO algorithm was exploited in context-aware and netw ork traf 002c 4 domains The focus in is on pro\002ling users and services in a mobile context-aware application while in is on the characterization of stream network data Both in and 5 the G EN IO algorithm is shortly introduced as a tool to extract generalized itemsets while this paper thoroughly describes the G EN IO algorithm and extensively analyzes its performance both on synthetic and real datasets VI C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we proposed the G EN IO algorithm to ef\002ciently address generalized itemset extraction An user provided taxonomy is exploited to merge rare patterns in more general expressions The behavior of the G EN IO algorithm has been tested on real network traf\002c data The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in discovering unexpected and generalized hidden knowledge in network traf\002c data Future works will address i the extention of G EN IO to incrementally update the extracted knowledge when new data become available ii the exploitation of multiple taxonomies over a single attribute and iii the application of the opportunistic generalization approach to more ef\002cient itemset extraction algorithms e.g LCM v.2 R EFERENCES  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and Sw ami Mining association

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
