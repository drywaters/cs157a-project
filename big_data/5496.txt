  when mining customer transaction database, and its core is recursive method based on the frequency of set theory association rules is an important topic in the field of Data mining, which described the law of knowledge model in a transaction between items of simultaneous. [18  Tied for second place the author is Quinlan, J.R 002 In 1993, he published a book 002÷\001\001 C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning", in which he proposed C4. 5 Algorithm improved version of ID3. The core idea of Decision Tree Algorithm is to use information entropy principle, select the properties of the maximum rate of information gain as a classification attribute, recursively construct the decision tree branches to complete the construction of decision tree. [19  2 0   Came in third place is the"Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases" published in1994 written by Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. in this article, R Agrawal proposed the well-known Apriori algorithm, which use the monotony of support to pruning the candidate sets thereby greatly reducing the number of candidate sets and the computing time, many of the association rules algorithms followed by are based on Apriori algorithm or its variants.[21  In addition 002 Breiman,L., Friedman,J.H., Olshen,R.A and Stone,C.J proposed the CART\(Classification and Regression Tree\ in their book 001\000 Classification and Regression Trees 001\001 published in 1984 Q u i n l a n, J.R proposed the proposed the ID3Decision Tree Algorithm in his article ìInduction of decision treesîpublished in 1986 24  T h es e d o cu m e n t s a r e  als o th e k e y an d im po rt an t  literatures in the study of international knowledge discovery KD\ and in the center of knowledge map of knowledge discovery , and they played an important role to promote study of international knowledge discovery\(KD  B  Analysis of the international KD research topics  Use keywords in bibliographies, and with software Citespace, we can determine the hot topics of international PIRM research. Although the keywords in an article are small in proportion, but they are the core and essence of the article, a highly condensed summary and concise of article theme, so the keywords of an article, especially the high frequency words are often used to determine the hot topics of some field  Ci t e s p a ce w r i t e n i n  J a va l a ngua ge  i s a visualization software based on Co-citation Analysis Running this software, you can analysis and process the path of the Co-citation network of the scientific document citation by using the pathfinder algorithm  o r m i ni m u m sp a nni ng trees algorithm [28  29  a n d  y o u ca n a l so d e t e r m i n e  t h e main areas and hot topics of international KD study by high frequency words display We input all the 3987 "KD" documents published in 1986-2009 into Citespace, network nodes selected keyword the source of key words select title,  abstract, descriptors and identifiers, lexical item select noun phrases, adjusting threshold of the Citespace to \(2, 2,20\, \(4, 3, 20\, \(4, 3, 20 and Select pathfinder algorithm, running Citespace. After sorted out, we got a list of key words that the total cites are more than 50 times\(see table 2\, as well as a knowledge map of the hot topics in international KD research in Figure 2  Table 2 the keywords frequency > 50 in "KD" documents  nu mbe r terms eme rgin g freq uen cy nu mb er terms emergi ng freque ncy 1 knowledge discovery 541 7 current knowledge 71 2 data mining 305 8 new knowledge 68 3 drug discovery 138 9 gene expression 68 4 prior knowledge 90 10 large database 61 5 neural network 81 11 recent discovery 51 6 association rule 80 12 binding site 50   Figure 2 shows the co-occurrence network of the highfrequency key words. From Figure 2 and Table 2, we can clearly see that the highest frequency term is knowledge discovery, the frequency is 541 times, followed by data mining, the frequency is 305 times, it shows that data mining and knowledge discovery inseparable, data mining is also the core and basis points of international KD study. The highfrequency keywords also show other hot topics of KD including drug discovery 001 prior knowledge 001 neural network 001 association rule and so on. The particularly worth mentioning is that KD\(data mining\ applications in the medical field. KD\(Data mining\ technology provides a new thinking and methods for drug discovery.KD\(data mining\technology can help researchers to discover the hidden knowledge in large database,, have a better, faster more efficient decision-making, improve competitiveness speed up the pace of drug discovery, improve the level of drug discovery.[3  3 1  3 2  001 In addition, neural network association rule is also the hot spots in the field of KD  C.

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
