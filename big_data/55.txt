Automatic Linguistic Resolution Framework and Applications Samuel W.K Chan School of Computer Science  Engineering The University of New South Wales Sydney NSW 2052 Australia ABSTRACT Like many natural cognitive processes natural language processing involves a simultaneous consideration of large number of different sources of information It is unrealistic to assume a single and simple recipe can solve the general problem of ambiguity In this article we shall show how linguistic resolutions can be achieved by using both rules and associations 
in a neurosymbolic framework and how context effects can be modeled and being carried over into the sentence analysis Three applications attest the validity of our framework This exploration contributes to our understanding in linguistic resolution as well as simulates the dynamic and complex processes that take place in text comprehension 1 INTRODUCTION Although there is a lot of theories in studying the word meanings, for many investigators the sense of words has at least one fundamental characteristic  it has a bundle of elementary semantic components Imagine being asked what boy means. One 
might answer by listing the attributes that seem to be necessary for something to be a boy say male, non-adult and human boy  male  non-adult  human The sense of boy has been broken up into the components. This is the basic idea of the component approach for linguistic information and there is an ultimate desire for linguists to extract a set of semantic components that cannot be decomposed any further and from which lexical associations can be achieved  11 On the other hands 
scholars of language and psycholinguistics have been among the first to stress the importance of rules in describing human behavior 2,3 The reason for this is obvious Many aspects of language can be characterized by rules When a writer uses the word boy as in The boy jumped the author does not have any incentive to refer the readers to any encyclopedic knowledge about the boy Boy is tool which the writer uses to point to the knowledge that is pertinent to the assertion he is trying to make This is the fundamental issue in 
the so-called functional approach to meaning Simply semantic component approach in representing meaning is certainly inadequate Instead of asking what boy means the functional approach asks how boy does what the writer intended it to do The writer certainly tries to convince his readers that the boy is an agent with an action jump in the sentence The boy jumped The functional view of meaning is that boy 0-7803-3280-6/96/%5.00 1996 IEEE  accomplishes what it does against its pure encyclopedic concept Regardless of the knowledge adopted it 
is now a consensus that the processing of natural languages should rely on these two component and functional approaches In this article we address the natural language understanding in terms of two fundamental issues 0 the elaborative inferences which draw heavily on the reader\222s general background knowledge in connecting the focal statement and the associations of knowledge surrounding the text We shall briefly delineate a framework with several applications in which the functional approach of meaning are achieved through a semantic relational network whilst the semantic associations 
via subsymbolic microfeatures are on the basis of component approach They interact intimately with each other in order to resolve the linguistic ambiguities 2 ARCHITECTURE OF THE FRAMEWORK The framework consists of several major constituents the parser logical and grounding tiers working memory WM sentence memory and a long-term LTM\as shown in Figure 1 7 Input Sentences memory SENTENCE WORKING MEMORY MEMORY Figure 1  The Framework The LTM has functional component The LTM stores the causal hypotheses and a set of commonsense inference rules 
All the linguistic cues are used to retrieve knowledge from the LTM after parsing. Vectors of knowledge or rules are recalled and displayed on the logical tier A semantic relational network is formed in this tier Table 1 shows an algorithm of the formation of the relational network The component approach of the lexical elements appears in the grounding tier which contains all the subsymbolic representations of concepts in the logical tier It is out of the scope of this paper to describe the detail formation of the grounding tier The 625  


interested readers can refer to the author's publications 4,51 1.For each of the input sentence, define a set of parsed propositions PP 2.For each of the parsed proposition a E PP define a set of relevant concept nodes Le proposition nodes and lexical nodes X E X and the corresponding possible case roles of each concept element if any in the parsed proposition a 3.Allocate the possible case roles nodes as the child node C\(Xi Negative conditional matrices are among them to indicate the mutual inhibitions 4.From the LTM append all the relevant concepts into X for each lexical nodes and set up an ordering for the all the concepts Xi E X  5.Check whether there are concepts left in X In the affirmative case do a Pick a concept Xi and append it as a node to the network b Set the parent node P\(Xi to some minimal set of nodes already in the net such that the follow equation is satisfied P\(XIJ2  x xilxj..xj E P\(Xi i 6,For all i define the conditional probability table for X which reflects the knowledge from the long term memory rable 1 The algorithm of setting up a semantic relation2 network During comprehension, a knowledge matrix K of the input sentence is formed and a unification process takes place in working memory in order to resolve the linguistic ambiguities The unification process is a special form of constraint satisfaction 6,7 which has been applied successfully in many subfields in cybernetic research The unification makes use of a set of linguistic nodes extracted from both tiers and a set of constraining relations The process is to assign every node a value from the given sentence such that each node satisfies the constraints based on energy minimization As the result the nodes are contextually relevant and all contradictions will be eliminated Further discussion is as follows 3 THE SEMANTIC RESOLUTIONS The first step involved in the simulation of text comprehension is to construct an associative network in working memory of the representational units and their interrelation as specified by the text To clarify the foregoing, let us represent the associative network by a knowledge matrix K where K\(ij specifies the link between nodes i and j in the associative network The construction of the matrix K makes use of the logical inferences and associations. This knowledge acquisition process involves instantiating a set of node corresponding to the linguistic input. The formation of knowledge matrix can be summarized in the algorithm as shown in Table 2 1 Propagate the initial evidence vector, which is equal to one from the input proposition a of the semantic relational network down to its concept nodes 2.For each extracted linguistic concept Xi with the degree of belief DBi c rc of the input proposition a initialize a corresponding initial evidence vector el e2  e E E i.e if Xi E a e t 1 else ei  0 when i  j if XI is an element in logical tier e t DB Each evidence vector serves as an independent evidence 3.At the same time for each extracted linguistic concept XI activate some of the highly associative nodes in its grounding tier and define the evidence vector for all the activated subsymbols zk as if zk is the subsymbol triggered by Xi then ek e DB x S\(Zi zk while others are Set to zero and S\(x,y is the similarity measure between x and y 4.For each evidence vector propagate the evidence through the semdntic relational network 5.lf the maximal implication chains have been traversed the result vector are assigned as the corresponding column of the knowledge matrix 6.Goto step 4 until all the columns of the knowledge matrix are complete Table 2 Algorithm of the formation of knowledge matrix K At the start of the process, a set of concept nodes of the text is constructed from an input proposition. The belief of each node is computed using Bayes rule Only the nodes with final degree of belief greater than a preset threshold tc are chosen Each entity serves as an independent clue for retrieving the semantic meanings and the related deductions drawn from the interwoven tier interactions in both tiers Evidence is then communicated along the links of the semantic relational network through the conditipnal probability matrices The beliefs are updated until all implication paths have been traversed. They are assigned as the elements in the corresponding column of the knowledge matrix K The process is repeated until all the columns of the knowledge matrix are completed The knowledge matrix so formed uses weak robust construction rules and is followed by a constraint satisfaction stage in a unification process. The process of unification is used to integrate the meanings in the memory into a coherent whole It strengthens the contextually appropriate elements and inhibits unrelated and inappropriate ones so that smart and complex deductions can be achieved The approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the stimulus so that a very complicated stimulus could act as if only a small number of independent elements are involved. These elements have some sort of activation values i.e central important concepts being more highly activated than else e  0 when i j peripheral ones The algorithm for the unification process is described in Table 3  626  


1.Set up the associative network and the knowledge matrix K in the working memory as described in Table 2 These elements form the network which are fully connected All these elements have degrees of belief greater than the preset threshold tc 2.Associated with each working memory element is a real number called its activation level, which represents the element's strength Let a vector U is modeled in n dimensional Euclidean space R then U\(t  ul u2  U where ui is the activation level for the element i and n is the number of nodes extracted at some discrete time t 3.Production firings, defined as a mapping function direct the flow of activation from one working memory element the source to another working memory elements through the knowledge matrix K and then subjected to a normalizing operation.

In the three different applications with detail discussions presented below we will exhibit how the system deals with these problems Each of them shows one of the aspects of the human sentence processing Case-Role Resolution To illustrate how the model can account for applying contextual constraints in sentences to arrive at a conceptually consistent case-role resolution, let us first compare the following sentences 1 Rosalind went to a store with her mum 2 Rosalind went to a store with her stick In the former the correct interpretation is to attach the prepositional phrase with her mum to the agent Rosalind as an agent modifier while in the second case stick to the verb went to indicate it is an instrument of the action Go The two different interpretations in form of propositions can be shown as follows l Go[Agent with\(Rosalind Mum Destination Store 2 Go[Agent Rosalind Destination Store Instrument Stick The problem remained is how can our system cope with these two subtle case-role interpretations whenever a sentence is input, say Sl Rosalind went to a store with her mum In order to resolve the case role in the sentence Sl all the possible interpretations are represented using different proposition formats. The modifier-role of Mum for the agent Rosalind in the sentence is represented as Agent with\(Rosalind Mum Destination Store while the instrument-role of Mum for the action Go is represented as Go[Agent Rosalind Destination Store Instrument Mum I U Figure 2 The semantic relational network for the case-role resolution Figure 2 shows the semantic relational network formed in the logical tier In the knowledge acquisition phase both of these interpretations are activated in parallel and concept nodes are added Obviously the two potential propositions are connected by the inhibitory links to ensure the non-coexistence in the final interpretation. More importantly in this example the meaning of the last word is decisive The word Mum is connected to two possible case-roles Znstrument[Mum and Agent[Mum due to the two different proposition formats and they both inhibit each other as shown in the Figure. Figure 3 shows the resulting associative network for sentence Sl in the working memory To simplify the example all the elaborations are ignored and only the most essentials are displayed The competing propositions and concepts are connected by inhibitory links whilst the positive connections are established by the logical deductions and the associations in both tiers  it is more appropriate to attach the phrase with her 627

Obviously if the sentence S2 Rosalind went to a store with her stick is input the semantic relational network in logical tier is broadly identical. The associative network in working memory differs only with respect to how the meaning of the concept Stick emerges as having strong association with the instrument The discrepancy between the Agent[Rosalind and Agent[Stick deteriorates the activation of Go With\(Rosalind Stick Store As a result the proposition Agent Rosalind Destination Store Instrument Stick will accomplish against the proposition Go[Agent: With\(Rosalind Stick Destination Store Lexical Disambiguation Our second application concerns the use of context to achieve the word-sense disambiguation Historically most approaches to the disambiguation problem have been based on logical inference with no quantitative measures of certainty Our approach provides an answer to one hard part of the problem  how to combine evidence from different sources in disambiguation Let us consider the following narrative excerpt Rosalind went to a store with her mum She wanted to give her mum a present Rosalind found out that everything was too expensive She decided to knit a sweater for her It is quite difficult to differentiate what the Store is by just reading the first sentence In order to demonstrate the disambiguating property of the framework first suppose the word Store is in the relational network as in Figure 4 It activates the nodes Storehouse and Dep-store plus some other associates both from the logical and grounding tiers I Figure 4 A fragment of semantic relational network which contains the concept Store The associative network is formed as in Figure 5 and unification is achieved with the initial activation U where Go[With\(Rosalind Mum Store Rosalind Mum Store Dep store Storehouse Shopping Gifr Warehouse 1 With\(Rosalind Mum 1 Destinatron[Store I U   c7 C6 c2 Node Name Pi GdWlth\(R M Stwe PZ Dsstln%tion]store P3 Wlth\(M Mum C1 Rcaahnd c2 store C3 Dep_slore C4 Shopping C5 Gm C6 Warehow c7 staehollse No Oflteratlons 17 Tolerance 1 0 005 u\(m 1.ooO 0.71 I 0.780 1 WO 0 871 0.202 0.216 0.135 0.814 0.754 Figure 5 Connections in working memory in lexical disambiguation. \(Only the related nodes in the disambiguation are shown It is highly apparent that Storehouse seems to dominate the Dep-store based on the knowledge in both tiers That is the concept Dep-store is less compatible with the context so far The process is continued to the next sentence.

This deletion is very significant considering that no information of any sort was required to perform it. This Interestingness Preprocess ing technique performed even better on the output of mining the WWW database using increasingly higher confidence levels deleting as much as 65 of the rules mined with 0.9 confidence levels, as indicated by the rightmost bar in the WWW database histogram out of the 1,503 rules mined the rightmost gray bar\977 rules \(the superimposed black bar\rules were deleted The other five histograms in Fig ure 2 summarize the results of applying the first Interesting ness PreProcessing technique to the other five databases The average deletion brought about by the application of the first Interestingness PreProcessing technique are 49.3 f 7.9 for the WWW database, 55.2 f 9.8% for the Mushroom database 69.4 If 18.0 for the Nursery database 57.7 f 7.3% for the Chess database, 72.6 f 8.6 for the Adult database and 3.7 f 1.5 for the Gro cery database These results are extremely encouraging a significant number in most cases an average of over half the rules outputted by the mining algorithm are deleted by the application of this preprocessing technique This is a significant result not only because of the large number of rules that is deleted but also because this deletion requires no information of any kind from a user of the KDD process 6.3.2 The results of the application of the Interestingness PrePro cessing 2 technique \(Section 5.2 to the six databases were more modest than those of the application of the first tech nique Even these modest results are very significant a re duction even of a small percentage of the rules is both ef fective and important when these results are achieved au tomatically without any interaction with any users The average elimination brought about by the second prepro Results Interestingness Preprocessing Tech 2 Figure 3 Results of the application of Inter estingness Preprocessing 2 technique cessing technique was as follows 3.3 f 3.4 for the WWW database 17.4 f 5 for the Mushroom database 2.5 f 2.7 for the Nursery database 3.1 f 1.8 for the Chess database 1 f 1.9% for the Adult database We present the detailed results in a graphical representation in Figure 3 for the first two databases 6.3.3 Results Sequential Application of Interesting ness Preprocessing Techniques As depicted in Figure 1, the Interestingness PreProcessing techniques can and should be applied sequentially We pro ceeded to do so applying the two preprocessing techniques we introduced in this paper sequentially The results of this sequential application are depicted in Figure 4 7 Conclusions and Future Work In this work we defined an Interestingness Preprocessing Step, as part of the interestingness analysis framework, that eliminates association rules that can be determined to be not interesting in a user-, domain-, and task-independent man ner The generic nature of the preprocessing differentiates it from the interestingness processing that do impose a bias on the type of rules outputted as interesting In this work we also introduced the first Interestingness PreProcessing techniques The deletion of un-interesting rules by these techniques is very significant since it is achieved without requiring a user to provide any informa tion Our empirical results indicate that these are powerful techniques in most cases more than half the rules were eliminated by their application It is important to note that any filtering power however weak of any preprocessing technique is significant since all the Preprocessing methods are deployed sequentially immediately following the min ing process on any set of mined rules and these results add up We hope that this work will encourage the development of more preprocessing techniques by the KDD community 495

 9 For instance, while in the “ISS Rendezvous Mode”, the function of actuating docking mechanisms might be disabled, and the firing of RCS thruster enabled. However in the “ISS Dock Mode”, the firing of RCS thrusters is inhibited, while docking actuation is available. On the left side of Figure 8 are the mode s from which entrance to the state is allowed.  Note that si nce there is more than one state from which you can enter the ISS Operations State”, the entrance modes called out may not all be in the same state Similarly, the exit modes on the right hand side of the diagram lead to modes in different states The spacecraft states and tran sition activities were then modeled as operational flows in CORE as shown in Figure 9 \(next page\e operational activities and their logical sequence are consistent with the Spacecraft State Transition Diagram shown above in Figure 7.  The operational model also identified the operational elements, which are tied to the physical hardware elements of the system that perform the operational activities Figure 8 Spacecraft Operational Modes  ISS Rendezvous Mode ISS Proximity Operations Mode ISS Dock Mode State Entrance State Exit S/C ISS Operations State From: Orbit Maneuver Mode To: Orbit Maneuver Mode From: ISS Checkout Mode To: ISS Checkout Mode ISS Undock Mode ISS Safe Haven Mode ISS Emergency Departure Mode From: S/C Powered Up Mode To: S/C Powered Up Mode 


 10 Figure 9 Spacecraft Operational Flow Functional Models After addressing the operational activities that the OSP system needed to perform, the functional models of the OSP system were developed consistent with the system engineering process discussed above.  The first step was to identify the physical hardware elements of the OSP system as prescribed by NASA.  The physical hardware elements of the OSP system were captured in CORE through component decomposition and represented as the product breakdown structure shown in Figure 10  Figure 10 Product Breakdown Structure of OSP System The OSP system functional models were developed by identifying the system functions based on the mission goals and operations that the system needed to perform.  These functions were then allocated to the prescribed physical hardware elements of the sy stem. As requirements and the system architecture evolved, the system functionality was re-allocated to different physi cal hardware elements.  In addition, the functional models also captured the physical interfaces between the OSP system, both internally and externally Interface Definition The CORE database also modeled and captured the interface complexity th at existed for the OSP system.  In the database a functional interface was represented as a collection of links that existed between physical hardware elements and an operational interface was represented as a collection of need-lines that existed between operational elements.  The links/need-lines were further defined by either  performance indices or constraints Internal and external functi onal interfaces were modeled within the CORE database by looking at different layers of the system physical hierarchy For example the interfaces between the OSP system and external systems were modeled as shown below in Figure 11, which depicts the interfaces that exist between the ISS Mating Adapter and ISS.  Internal functional inte rfaces were also modeled by looking at the interfaces that ex ist within the OSP System's physical product breakdown structure.  For example, Figure 12 shows the internal interfaces that exist w ithin the OSP System between the  ISS Mating Adapter \(ISSMA Spacecraft.

Therefore the OSP system had to meet the mission objectives using only existing technologies.  These existing technologies were introduced into the CORE modeling database as requirement constraints on the OSP system Requirements Management Requirements management was performed within the CORE database to track and perform requirements flowdown as well as tie the requirements together with the operational models, functional models, and technologies Requirements told either how well the system needed to perform, set constraints on the system, or defined the interfaces.  In the CORE database, all requirements appeared as either performance indices or constraints The customer objectives were introduced into the CORE database as originating requirements.  These originating requirements included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, guidelines, and standards.  Originating requi rements were then traced to OSP System Level requirements.  The OSP System Level requirements defined the performance indices and constraints at the system leve l.  These performance indices and constraints were then flowed down and decomposed into lower level performance i ndices and constraints at the segment level, element level, and component level.  This supported the development of the system and segment performance specifications and requirements traceability matrix All of the requirements captured in CORE were directly tied to either the operational model, functional model, or technologies.  If the requirement was a performance requirement, it was tied to either the operational or functional model through a performance index.  The performance index indicated how well the function or operation needed to be accomplished. The function or operation in turn was tied back to the hardware elements of the OSP system.  For example, the requirement for two days of contingency operations by the spacecraft while not mated to ISS was represented as a performance index exhibited by the “Spacecraft On-O rbit Operations” activity previously shown in Figure 9. The “Sp acecraft On-Orbit Operations activity was in turn performed by the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement set a constraint on the system, it was depicted as a constraint on either an operational element or hardware element in CORE.  For example, the requirement that the spacecraft shall have an operational service life of thirty years was captured in CORE as a constraint on the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement defined an interface, it appeared as either a performance index or constraint on a link.  For example, the requirement that the mechani cal interface between the ISS Mating Adapter and Spacecraft shall be the Low Impact Docking System \(LIDS constraint that was placed on 


 12 the “Mating Adapter to Sp acecraft Docking/Attachment Mechanism\(s\k previously identified in Figure 12 One of the challenges for the requirements management process was capturing the manmachine interfaces.  This specific challenge was to develop and implement a methodology that allowed operational requirements to drive the physical hardware design.  In CORE, this was accomplished by allowing performance indices tied to the operational model to decompose into performance indices related to the operational model as well as the functional model 6  C ONCLUSION  A robust systems engineering process is required for a large scale program with many interfaces.  The processes and implementation presented in this paper are ideal when faced with a rapidly changing requirements environment and dynamic interfaces.   Traditional acquisition of systems revolves around a rigid set of design-to requirements.   As recent history has shown, opera tionally based acquisition is on the rise.  This means that requirements are more likely to be in flux further into the program The C4ISR methodology and implementation presented in this paper provide a robust system engineering process for a large scale program with many interfaces.  In particular, the dynamic interfaces and the integration of human interfaces were handled through the development of segment states and modes.  The state transitions were driven by system operations.  This operations based systems engineering is necessary to understand large, complex systems The process was implemented using the CORE systems engineering tool.  A flexible tool such as CORE was required to build the custom schema required for this unique program.  The capability to rigorously define the dynamic interfaces as well as decompose those interfaces was required to capture the dynamics of operationally driven systems.  Functional and physical models responded to these operations. This implementation in CORE allowed for a “Systems of Systems” view to be modeled within the same database as requirements management The demise of the OSP and precursor programs cut short the full implementation of this process.  Given time, states modes, and then operational and functional models would have been built for all segments of the system.  In addition the end to end traceability from operational requirements to component design requirements would have provided a robust platform for system verification While human spaceflight is a unique problem, the issue of systems of systems” integration is present in many fields When this is coupled with human integration, the need for an operations approach is multiplied.  Determining how to operate a system after it is functionally and physically designed results in delays and cost escalation.  An approach that takes into account human interaction and operations at the outset is more likely to re sult in a system that succeeds throughout the program lifecycle 7  R EFERENCES    DoD Archi t ect ure Fram ework W o rki ng Group DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.0” August 30, 2003 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The primary development effort of the C4ISR CORE methodology as implemented on the OSP program was completed by Michael Wood, Orbital Sciences Corporation and Marge Dyer, Vitech Corporation 9  B IOGRAPHY  Staci N.

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
