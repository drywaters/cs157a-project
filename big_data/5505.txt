China E-MAIL: cqwzjsjfg@163.com, dcs-yh 263.net, xjcq123@sohu.co m, zhao8956@163.com Abstract At present, existing associati on rules mining algorithms have redundant candidate freque nt itemsets and repeated computing. This paper proposes an algorithm of locating order mining based on sequence numb er, which is suitable for mining long frequent itemsets. In ord er to fast search long frequent itemsets, the algorithm adopts not only traditional down search but also the method of locating order of subset to generate candidate frequent items ets. It has two aspects, which are different from traditional down se arch mining algorithm. One is that the algorithm need locate order of subsets of non frequent itemsets via down search. The other is that the algorithm uses character of attribute sequence number to compute support for only scanning database once. The algorithm may efficiently delete repeated L-candidate fre quent itemsets generated by L+1\loca ting subsets order, whose efficiency is improved. The resu lt of experiment indicates that the algorithm is suitable for mining long frequent itemsets, and it is faster and more efficient th an present algo rithms of mining long frequent itemsets Keywords Long frequent itemsets; Down search; Locating order Sequence number; Association rules 1  Introduction In order to reduce redundant candidate frequent itemsets and the times of scanning database, people propose some mining algorithms, such as, IDMFI A as In order to easily generate candidate frequent itemsets and fast compute support, some binary mining al gorithms were presented, such as in [2, 3, 4, and ori as in faster than Apri ori for binary logic operation, and B-ARDSM is also fas ter than IDMFIA when double mining, and although ARNBSN  er t h an B-Apri ori it is only suitable for mining short frequent itemsets. ITDASN as in  is suitable for mining long frequent itemset s, but there are still redundant candidate frequent itemsets and repeated computing when mining algorithm generates L-candidate frequent itemsets of L+1\ itemsets. A nd so, this paper proposes an algorithm of locating order mining based on sequence number, denoted by ALOMSN, whi ch is suitable for mining long frequent itemsets, and is faster and more efficient than ITDASN as in 2  Base Notions and Properties Definition 1 Binary Transaction BT  transaction T is expressed as character string b 1  b 2  b m  b k   0, 1 k 1 m if i k  T and then b k 1, otherwise b k 0 Example let I 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} be an itemsets, if a transaction is expressed as T i 2, 5, 6}, and then BT i  010011 Definition 2 Digital Transaction DT is an integer and its value is decimal integer of binary transaction Example if BT 010010\ then DT 18 Definition 3 Digital Item DI and it is the simplest digital transaction which only expresses an item attribute Example let I  i 1  i 2  i m and then DI 1 1 DI m  2 m-1  Definition 4 Digital Transaction Length DTL  integer, it is equal to the su m of 1Ž in Binary Transaction Definition 5 Suppose digital transaction of T 1 is denoted by DT 1 digital transaction of T 2 is denoted by DT 2 If T 1  T 2  and then DT 1  DT 2  DT 1 is regarded as subset of DT 2 which is regarded as superset of DT 1  Definition 6 Sequence Number SN is a group of ordered number, here, these numbers may be repeated, and each number is called a sub-Item of sequence number Example let SN 46, 124, 65, 125, 79, 62, and 112} be a sequence number, thereinto, 124 is called a sub-Item of Sequence Number Definition 7 Sub Item Dimension SID s an integer it is equal to the sum of 1Ž in binary code of sub-Item Example, let 58 be a sub-Item, and then SID 58 SID  111010 2 4 Definition 8 Sequence Number Dimension SND  an integer, it is equal to the sum of items SID contained by 403 2010 IEEE 978-1-4244-6527-9/10/$26.00 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010

The algorithm uses the feature of locating order to solve the rest proble ms, i.e. it can automatically delete an item of l non frequent itemsets to generate  l 1\ndidate frequent itemsets, and then uses the relation between length and order of subset to delete repeated  l 1\ndidate itemsets Let I  i 1  i 2  i m be an itemsets, and let ISet save digital item DI ely ISet  t 2 t  t 0 m 1\uppose there are N  l non frequent itemsets, let NFSet save them, and let CSet save l 1\Aiming to each NFSet  i  ich  saves i the first l non frequent itemsets, these rules of generating subset are expressed as follows Rule 1 Aiming to each l non frequent itemsets, namely NFSet  i  e su m o f   l 1\subset generated by NSet  i   denoted by Sum  NFSet  i  length  NFSet  i  LNo  Rule 2 when NFSet  i  rat es j the first l 1\set, if location identifier deleted by NFSet  i  is de note d  by  ID and ID   NFSet  i  LNo  j 1 Rule 3 when NFSet  i  ge ne r a tes j the first l 1 which is saved by CSet  j  valu e of its domain are expressed as follows CSet  j  value  NFSet  i  value  ISet  NFSet  i  location ID   CSet  j  length  NFSet  i  length-1  CSet  j  LNo  NFSet  i  LNo  j 1\, namely ID  CSet  j  location [0... \(CSet j length-1   NFSet  i  location [0 ID 1 ID 1ƒ \(NFSet i length-1  Let i 1  i 2  i m be a transaction, whose digital transaction is denoted by CT its information of data structure is expressed as follows CT  value 2 m-1  CT  length  m  CT  LNo 0 CT  location [0 0 CT  location m 1  m 1 The algorithm of generating   l 1\date itemsets is expressed as follows Input: there are N  l non frequent itemsets, and these itemsets are saved NFSet  Output: there are C  l 1\hese itemsets are saved CSet  Generate-Candidate\(NFSet,CSet 1\OR i 1 i  N  i  2\FOR j 1 j NFSet i  length NFSet i  LNo  j  3 ID NFSet i  LNo  j 1 4\     C valu e=NFSet i  value  ISet [NFSet i  location ID   5\ CSet[C length NFSet i  length 1 6\ CSet[C LNo NFSet i  LNo  j 1 7\     FOR k 0 k  ID  k  Delteing ID the first item 8\     C location  NFSet i  location k   9\FOR k  ID 1 k NFSet i  length  k  10\      CS  location  NFSet[i  location k   11\M = 0 404 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  12 13 3.3  The Key Technique of Computing Support The method of computing support adopted by the algorithm is expressed as follows Step1: According to definition 1 the algorithm extracts Binary Transaction from original database Step2: Aiming to each item, its corresponding Binary code is turned into Sequence Number in subsection according to definition 6  Step3: Aiming each candidate frequent itemsets, we knew that every item in candidate has own Sequence Number and then we will use Boolean calculation compute these Sequence Number in turn, and fina lly the result is new Sequence Number Step4: Computing Sequence Number Dimension of the new Sequence Number according to definition 8 Its value is equal to support of candidate frequent itemsets For example, there are ten transactions in database. The course of computing support is expressed as follows Step1: Extracting Binary Transaction from database T 1 a, b, c, e, f     BT 1 111011 2  T 2 a, c, d, e, f     BT 2 101111 2  T 3 a, b, e, f BT 3 110011 2  T 4 a, b, c BT 4 111000 2  T 5 b, c, d, e, f     BT 5 011111 2  T 6 c, d, e, f BT 6 001111 2  T 7 a, c, d, f       BT 7 101101 2  T 8 c, d, e BT 8 001110 2  T 9 a, b, c, e, f     BT 9 111011 2  T 10 b, d, e, f BT 10 010111 2  Setp2: Computing Sequence Number of each sub-Item in database is expressed as table 1 T ABLE 1  C OMPUTING S EQUENCE N UMBER  No. a  b c d e f BT 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 BT 2 1 0 1 1 1 1 BT 3 1 1 0 0 1 1 BT 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 BT 5 0 1 1 1 1 1 Item 1 30 23 27 9 29 29 BT 6 0 0 1 1 1 1 BT 7 1 0 1 1 0 1 BT 8 0 0 1 1 1 0 BT 9 1 1 1 0 1 1 BT 10 0 1 0 1 1 1 Item 2  10 3 30 29 23 27 SN 30 10 23 3 27 30 9 29 29 23 29 27 Step3: Let C = {c, d and e} be a candidate frequent itemsets, and then Computing its support, denoted by Support C SN \({c}\27, 30 SN \({d}\ {9, 29 SN \({e}\29, 23 SN \({c, d, e}\{27&9&29, 30&29&23  9, 20 Support \(C\ = SND \({9, 20  SND \(9\SND \(20 2 + 2  4 3.4  The Process of Search Frequent Itemsets FSet saving frequent itemsets FI  NFSet saving NFI of searching down same length CSet saving candidate frequent itemsets of searching down same length Step1 The algorithm changes original transaction into mining transaction, namely, origi nal database is turned into D  on descending by digital tr ansaction according to definition 1 and 2  Step2 The algorithm computes support of first candidate frequent itemsets wh ich contain all item attributes if it is frequent itemsets, and then it will be written to FSet  then algorithm goes to Step5 Otherwise, it will be written to NFSet  Step3 The algorithm generates frequent itemsets. There are two parties as follows Firstly, the algorithm us es the function of Generate Candidate  NFSet  CSet o generate l 1 l non frequent itemsets And then, aiming to each l 1\sets of CSet if it is not subset of FSet then computing its su pport by chapter 3.3 If it is a frequent itemset then it is written to FSet otherwise it is a non frequent item sets which is written to NFSet  Step4 The algorithm needs repeat doing Step3 until frequent itemsets isnt generated by algorithm Step5 The algorithm output FSet  4  Comparing the capa bility of algorithms According to the content of reference [4  e  knew that ARNBSN is more efficient than B-Apriori when mining short frequent itemsets, ITDASN is only suitable for mining long frequent itemsets. Hence, here we only compare ALOMSN with ARNBSN and ITDASN 4.1  Analyzing the Capability of Algorithms ARNBSN: The algorithm is similar to B-Apriori when generating candidate frequent ite msets, but the method of 405 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  computing support is computing Sequence Number Degree The algorithm only need scan once all these transactions and use Boolean calculation to compute this Sequence Numbers Degree, and so the efficiency of algorithm is improved efficiently. It is more efficient th an B-Apriori, but it is only suitable for mining short frequent itemsets ITDASN: The algorithm is only suitable for mining long frequent itemsets since this do wn search strategy is adopted It uses the way of binary B oolean calculation to generate binary candidate frequent items ets, and uses the method of computing Sequence Number Degree to obtain support of candidate frequent itemsets. But the algorithm have redundant candidate frequent itemsets and repeated computing when it generates L-candidate frequent itemsets of L+1\sets ALOMSN: The algorithm is also suitable for mining long frequent itemsets through down search. It also uses the method of computing Sequence Number dimension to obtain support of candidate frequent itemsets. The algorithm uses the way of binary Boolean cal culation to generate binary candidate frequent itemsets, but the algorithm need locate order of subsets when it generates L-candidate frequent itemsets of \(L+1\item sets, and so the algorithm is able to delete redundant candidate frequent itemsets and repeated computing to improve efficiency 4.2  Comparing the Experiment of Algorithms Now we use these results of experiment to testify above analyses. We use three mining algorithms to generate frequent itemsets from these transactions, their Binary Transactions are expressed as digital from 1 to 4095, there are 12 items attribute in database, i.e m 12 N 4095 Our experimental circumstances are expressed as follow R\PU 420 1.60 GHz, 1.24G language of the procedure is Visual C# 2005.NET, OS is Windows XP Professional The result of generating frequent itemsets about algorithms ARNBSN and ALOMSN is expressed as Fig. 1 and the result of generating frequent itemsets about algorithms ITDASN and ALOMSN is expressed as Fig. 2 here is absolute support. As the support and length of frequent itemsets change, the runtime of ARNBSN and ALOMSN is expressed as Fig 3.

locate   s conditional PLMS-tree in the mining of sequence     s super-patterns. In line 7 through 9, we examine the mps of each node n  and record their minimum mps This value will be used in next step  In line 12 through line 18, secondly, we generate candidate  patterns and output sequential patterns according to each item's icount  Three conditions may occur here The first is that the icount satisfies MIS   This sequence is directly appended to icount 40% which reaches the MIS bde 30%, pattern bde   can be joined into the sequential patterns set. We can see that an infrequent pattern's super set become frequent pattern in this case that is why we need to consider about the  mps  value The other sequential patterns which are started from other items are generated in the same way Finally we can have the complete sequential patterns with MMS by MSCP-growth algorithm the sequential patterns set. The second is that the icount doesn't  V  C ONCLUTION satisfy MIS   but satisfies mps That is, the sequence is currently not a sequential pattern but its super-pattern i.e appending suffix in the sequence has possibility to be Therefore both two conditions have to keep growing and recursively call procedure MSCP-growth for further examining their super-patterns. The third is that the count of sequence doesn't satisfy both MIS   and mps It means that any super- pattern of the sequence   will never be a sequential pattern The procedure will terminate while the root set becomes empty  We use the constructed PLMS-tree in Fig.12 to explain the  mining process in detail At first the  RS  is root and we trace all nodes belong to the first item e in HT According to the nlink of  item e from HT we find \(_ e 1:11111001 n 1 at first, the  position code shows that n 1 is a descent node of RS and n 1 is not recounted in the same branch  n 1  icount  will be add into icount  since n 1 does not have any child node, no node will be  joined into nRS According to the nlink in \(_ e 1:11111001\, the  next node \(_ e 2:101 n 2 will be found n 2 is a descent node of  root and n 2 is not recounted n 2  icount will be added into icount  n 2  also has a child node \(_ c 2:1011\, that can be joined into the  nRS to be a new root set if we need to growth this pattern. And  the next node \(_ e 1:10111011\ is recounted so the node count of this node will not be added into icount Since the icount of In this study, we first address the rare item problem in the  mining of sequential patterns To generate more interesting patterns we extend the concept of MMS on sequential pattern mining and propose an algorithm named MSCP growth to discover complete set of sequential pattern with MMS In experimental study we will compare three well-known traditional methods including GSP PrefixSpan and PLWAP tree with MSCP-growth using several synthetic datasets as well as real-life datasets. Some research directions are briefly  discussed First users may have to tune items supports many times while discovering useful patterns Instead of restarting the whole mining process it is valuable if a support tuning mechanism can be developed Second the concept of MMS can be further applied to constraint-based sequential pattern mining such as time constraints or duration constraints    R EFERENCES item  e  is 60 which reaches the candidate growth condition we mentioned before, we use the nRS and e as a candidate pattern to generate new patterns Pattern  e  also reaches the threshold of sequential pattern i.e MIS e  and can be joined into the sequential patterns set. The second step uses the node in the nRS  _ c 2:1011\, as the new root set of conditional tree to growth new pattern\(s According to  HT  the  icount  of first item e  rooted by _ c 2:1011 is 20 which does not reach the candidate growth condition The  icount  of second item  c  in  HT rooted by _ c 2:1011 is 40 which reaches the condition to growth new candidate patterns so we use the child nodes of _ c 2:1011 _ a 1:10111\ and \(_ b 1:10111\, as nRS to generate new candidate patterns. This pattern also larger than MIS ec which means it can be joined into the sequential patterns set. The complete sequential patterns set with beginning item  e  can be generated by repeating these steps  The reason we use the mps value and candidate growth will  show in following example. We trace the item b now, the icount  of item b is 100% which reaches the condition to generate new candidate and the threshold to be joined into the sequential patterns set. As the tracing step goes, we have the icount of item d 60 in the suffix tree of pattern  b  it reaches the  mps  value=30%, which is the second condition to candidate growth we mentioned before, and it means that this pattern still has possibility to be part of sequential pattern Noted that it doesn't reach MIS bd 65 which means it is not a sequential pattern In the next candidate growth step, we have item e with 1     2    3     4     5      6     7     8      9   Y.-H.

Post Mining o/Non-redundant Association Rules /or Sensor Data Estiamtion In this subsection, we describe our proposed technique for post mining of non-redundant association rules for sensor data estimation purpose. This algorithm is developed based on non-redundant informative association rules which means all rules cannot be derived from other rules and the left hand side and right hand side of the selected rules contain the input itemset. There are some research works that can generate the closed itemsets and corresponding association rules using generated closed itemsets [3 , 18 Based on our previous works [8] we assume to have the non-redundant association rules ready and the criteria of selecting the rules from non-redundant rules further reduce the number of rules to the minimum In this algorithm, dn.vm is treated as one item in association rules. Dn represents the sensor which is indexed as n. Vm represents the value of the sensor n is read as m. In the following figure, Xinput is the itemset represent the current round of sensor readings, it can be represented by a set of dn.vm pairs. Xl and X2 are the itemsets in left hand side and right hand side of association rules. Z represents all items in X2/Xinput. Index\(z z and value of sensor value pair z. Confidence{Xl=>X represents the confidence of the rule Xl=>X2 Support\(Xl=>X2 C represents the confidence of association rule, dn V represents the identifier and value pair of the sensor dn Xestimate represents the returned estimation itemset which contains the senor identifiers with missing values in the current round of readings of stream data and their corresponding estimated values. Sspecify represents the user specified support, and Cspecify represents the user-specified confidence The algorithm is described as below. The input of the procedure Estimate includes the current round of sensor reading, current association rule confidence, user-specified minimum support and user-specified minimum confidence 


In line 4, all association rules that satisfy with the conditions of minimum support and confidence are selected The confidence of the select association rules are calculated in line 5. The condition of line 6 filters out the rules whose left hand side itemset Xl does not contain the itemset Xinput in this case, sensor identifier is filtered based on the enriched contextual information. The condition of line 7 filters out the rules whose right hand side itemset X2 does not contain new estimated items.

Several different simulation experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the proposed technique and compare it with the Average Window Size A WS linear trend approach, and with the WARM approach, the state-of-the-art data estimation algorithm in sensor databases using 2-frequent itemsets based association mining [6]. We compared the estimation accuracy, running time and memory space usage when applying different methods to the application dataset The dataset was collected in year 2000 at various locations throughout the city of Austin, Texas. The data represents the current location, the time interval, and the number of vehicles detected during this interval. All sensor nodes report to a single server. The sensors are deployed on city streets, collect and store the number of the vehicles detected for a given time interval. The vehicle counts taken as sensor readings that are used as input for our simulation experiments are traffic data provided by [2 A. Performance Study of Estimation Accuracy The evaluation of the estimation accuracy of the missing values is done by using the average Root Mean Square Error RMSE I'\(xa, -Xe 1 ___ l __ lI_?''? ____ _ numStates # estimations where Xa; and Xe; are the actual value and the estimated value, respectively; #estimations is the number of estimations performed in a simulation run; and numStates is the number of subsets, in which the actual readings are distributed The expression u  xa, -Xe estimations error and is an estimate of the standard deviation under the assumption that the errors in the estimated values \(i.e. Xai Xei 


see the smaller the RMSE, the better the estimation accuracy From Figure 2, we can see that the proposed technique gives the best average estimation result of the above approaches regarding the accuracy, followed by the WARM approach. The linear interpolation, A WS, and linear trend approaches perform no better than WARM and the proposed approaches. From Figure 2, we can also see that the proposed technique gives the best estimation result on the maximum estimation accuracy, which is the root square error for the maximum difference between the estimated and accurate values 0.6 0.5 0.4 w n 0.3 cz 0.2  Average 0.1  Maximum 0 l' ?? 0" </.,oQ Figure 2.

Performance Study of Memory Usage Figure 4 illustrates the memory usage of A WS, linear interpolation, linear trend, WARM and proposed approaches in MB. The experimental results show that in terms of memory space, the WARM approach is outperformed by all the other four approaches. The results of the simulation experiments show that for 108 sensors the needed memory space using WARM is much higher than that using proposed approach. This is because the closed lattice data structure uses less memory space than the cube data structures, and it only stores the condensed closed itemsets information Figure 4. Performance study of memory usage for traffic monitoring application in MB V. CONCLUSTIONS Sensor stream applications are becoming very common with the advances in technologies for sensor devices. In this paper we propose a method to post mine non-redundant association rules, and used the result to produce missing data estimation in sensor network applications. The objective is to further reduce the resulting rules from non redundant association rule mining based on the users request, and apply the retrieved meaningful information to perform missing data estimation in wireless sensor networks We have evaluated the proposed technique with real data from a wireless sensor network of a traffic monitoring site Our proposed method is able to estimate missing sensor value with both time and space efficiency, and greatly improves the estimation accuracy. Our performance study 


shows that proposed post mining of association rule mining technique for missing sensor data estimation is an area worth to explore REFERENCES 1] Agrawal, R., & Imielinski, T., & Swami, A., "Mining association rules between sets of items in massive databases", International Conference on Management of Data, 1993 2] Austin, F.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
