Hypergraph Clustering Model Based on Fuzzy Frequent Itemsets Applied in Management of Agricultural Land Evaluation Liu Yang Zhang Shiyi School of Resource and Environmental Science WuHan University Wuhan, China E-mail: liuyang.whu@163.com  Zhu Lifang School of Urban and Environmental Science Huazhong No rmal University Wuhan  China E-mail Address: zlft11@163.com  Abstract  There are two shortages in usual methods for agricultural land evaluation: \(1\ manual interferences into the calcu lating procession; \(2\ively large differences of partial units are concealed in certain factors. We designed a hypergra ph clustering model in this paper based on fuzzy freque 
nt itemsets to conduct the evaluation  for quality of agricultur al land. The database for land units is composed with the fuzzy feature vectors. It executes the mining association rules to the fuzzy itemsets given by the definition of evaluation factors  and analyzes the clusters with the HMETIS segmentation method, finally devises the transactions similarity function to cluster the services. With the following check ing example in some region in South China, it not only determines the quality rating of each units of agricultural land, but also gives the quality description for each grade  Keywords agricultural land evaluation; hypergraph clustering model; fuzzy frequent itemset; transaction database  I. INTRODUCTION The substance of evaluation for agricultural land management is a process of analyz ing the information of agricultural land quality\(p roduction conditions determining the evaluatio 
n criterion and hierarchizing the analysis. When applying the factor method in the agricultural land evaluation, it might be possible that the defects of a certain condition would be concealed by the advantages of some other factors, but this kind of defects could be the sill which restricts the quality of farmland In this paper we design a method which composes 2 steps establishing the hypergraph model and clustering data based on hypergraph. Firstly the transaction database is constructed from th e evaluation units database. During this process, we set index description of evaluation factor as an data item, and express it as a vertex in hypergraph. The correlated items would be connected by weighted hyperedges. A hyperedge represents a relationship in the subset of evaluation units data. The weight of hyperedge shows the intensity of the relationship. Then applying the hypergraph partitioning algorithm to cluster the vertexes 
and we will get the corresponding index for evaluation factors-clusters of items. Finally, these items from the cluster is used to describe the clu ster which the transaction belongs.\(Fig. 1 II.

The attribute value of agricu ltural land units might be continuous or discrete. We need to apply the fuzzy sets theory to create the membership function for each attribute and change attribute data to th e dimensionless items which show the monotonically increasing tendency. The continuous property membership data is divided into several intervals. Each interval composes a subset of the certain property which called a fuzzy itemset. If the supporting degree of the fuzzy itemset is higher than the setting threshold, this itemset is called a fuzzy frequent itemset. Mining the association rules according to the fuzzy frequent itemsets would be agreeable to show the fuzzy phenomena in the land qua lity of evaluation units  B  Constructing the model It is assumed that there are m evaluation units of agricultural land in a certain region n evaluation factors the index data with multi-resource of evaluation unit i is defined as X j j=1Én x i1 x i2  x in A membership function of each evalua tion factors is established in the discussed area, which subjects to Y j   j X j=1Én  And the value of membership from each index of factors for a evaluation unit is derived. Getting y ij   j  x ij  Y i  y i1 y i2  y in is regarded as the fuzzy feature vector of evaluation unit Xi. The transaction database is composed by the fuzzy feature vectors For a weighted hypergraph H V E Fig.2\set V is constituted of fuzzy itemsets, and hyperedge E is composed of fuzzy frequent itemsets. A hyperedge is expressed by a fuzzy frequent itemset, and the weight of each hyperedge is defined as the average value of all the main association rulesê credibilities of the hyperedge. The main association rule is a formul a which includes all the items of hyperedge and there is only one item on the right side. The way to get the main association rules will be introduced behind                  III. ASSOCIATION RULE S AND THE MINING ALGORITHM A  mining algorithm of Association rule Mining association rules is aimed at obtaining all the association rules which satisfy the minimum supporting degree-Minsupport and the minimum credibility Minconfidence. Firstly all the frequent itemsets in dataset D can be quickly searched according to the minimum supporting degree, then the association rules will be get from the frequent itemsets and the minimum credibility B  Generation of association rules After mining all the frequent itemsets in the dataset, the strong association rules which satisfy the minimum supporting and cred ibility can be produ ced. The specific operating introductions is followed: for each frequent itemset 1 to generate all the non-empty subsets of 1, if    We get an association rule s =>\(l - s among which sup por _ count\(l\numbe r of transaction records which contained itemset 1 sup port _ count\(s\ the number of transaction records which contained itemset s min_ conf is the threshold of minimum credibility. The association rules are directly produced by the fre quent itemsets, therefore all the itemsets that involve in the rules will satisfy the threshold of minimum supporting degree IV. TOP-DOWN HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING ALGORITHM BASED ON HYPERGRAPH Hypergraph partitioning algorithm HMETIS is applied in the cluster analysis which belongs to divisive hierarchical clustering methods. HMETIS is a efficient layered hypergraph partitioning algorithm. It divides the vertices of hypergraph into k parts which are roughly the same and makes the least number of hyperedges which connect different parts A  Item clustering-the classification of fuzzy frequent  items for evalu ation factors To purify the division results we need to eliminate meaningless classes at first. Higher quality value of class implies that the inside edge of division has a greater weight If the quality value of class is higher than the setting division threshold, the clusters are considered to be fine It is assumed that e represents a vertex set of hyperedge The standard for measuring whether division c is good or bad is defined as follows   After obtaining the g ood division, we need to check the vertices in the division and filter those vertices which are not strong correlated with others. The vertex with high correlation value shows it has many edges which connect     c ec e e Weight e Weight c Quality 0           conf s count por l count por min_   _ sup   _ sup   Y 1 Y 2 Y 3 Y Y 5 e 2  e 1 e 3 e 4 e 5   v    V 2  V 3  V 4  V 5      Figure 2. the binary hypergraph of farmland evaluation based on fuzzy itemsets

with other vertices .If the correlation value of a vertex is higher than the given threshold, the vertex would be considered that it belongs to th e division, or the vertices would be eliminated from the division. The correlation function of vertex v is defined as follows Re levancy  v  c    e  e  c  v  e  e  e  c  After purifying the division by the 2 standards above, we can get high quality division of the vertices, in other words the clusters that fu zzy items belong B  Transactions clusterevaluation un its classification The hypergraph clustering model constructed in this paper is clustering the transactions of evaluation units by clustering the items of evaluation factors. That is to say, the description of th e transactions clusters can also belong with the data items of factors in the classification.

FARMLAND QUALITY EVALUATION OF HESHAN CITY According to the natural and economic attributes of farmland in Heshan City, we make comprehensive assessments for the farmland quality and divide the results into several grades. In this case, 10 factors are chosen to be analyzed \(Table I polygons act as the evaluation units which come from the land use database with the scale of 1:10000. There are 7149 evaluation units in the database TABLE I.

CONCLUSIONS The substance of target item clustering is that it definites the range or value for the factors of a certain type or level agricultural land. This kind of evaluation ideas are more in line with the characters of agricultu ral land use type which can avoid the defects that factors offset each other brought by the factor analysis method Establishing the corresponding relationship for the index range and clustering results fr om a certain group or some groups of correlated evaluation factors, we can fully reflect the leading role of the main evaluation factors act in determining the unitês level.

As above mentioned, the time of mining FWIs by WIT-tree algorithms is more efficient than the time of mining by Apriori-based. By WIT-tree data structure, the algorithms only scan the database once. The algorithm based on Diffset is faster than the others because it saves more memory for storing and therefore, the time of computing Diffset is more efficient In this paper, we only improve the phase of mining FWIs by WIT-tree. In the future, we will study how to mine efficient association rules from FWIs. Besides, mining association rules from frequent weighted closed itemsets \(FWCIs\ more efficient than from FWIs.
