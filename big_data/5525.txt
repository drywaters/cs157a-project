Genome-wide association studies \(GWAS\ which examine the correlations between single genetic variants and single phenotypes have contributed to identifying disease susceptible loci [1  Ach ievem ents o f recen t GWAS have shown that the variants identified capture only a small fraction of the heritability of common diseases despite our broad understanding of genetic architecture of complex traits. Unexplained heritability can be attributed to a lack of reflection on exposure assessment, sample size and heterogeneity [2-4 Regarding the heterogeneity issue, a bias in case and control samples characterizing a single trait may arise if we assume that a single nucleotide polymorphism SNP\ influences on a single trait without considering genetic nature such as pleiotropy [3, 5  Th e pleiotr op y occurs when a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits. The multiple phenotypic traits are phenotypic associations among single traits. They may be due to association of proximal genetic loci forming a large block of linkage disequilibrium \(LD\6 In this regard incorporation of the multiple phenotypic traits to the GWAS can be an alternative way to unravel missing heritability in the GWAS Although the GWAS of mult iple phenotypic traits can play important role to enhance the power of GWAS such an approach has not been well pursued To detect genetic variants associated with multiple phenotypic traits, applicat ion of traditional GWAS approaches has suffered penalties from testing multiple genome-wide markers of single traits. This may reduce the power of GWAS due to elevating impurity and bias in samples. Previous works [5, 7 h a v e sh ow n  th at GWAS of multivariate phenotypes increase more power than GWAS of single phenotypes separately. In this context, we make an effort to the discovery of novel multivariate phenotypes among a set of single traits and the development of an approach to GWAS of multivariate phenotypes Regarding selection of samples   one  s ho ul d minimize phenotypic heterogeneity and enrich disease predisposing markers in order to select optimal cases Selection of optimal cases for the multivariate phenotypes is more problematical than that of single traits since the genetic architecture of most of them have not been explored much Selection of optimal controls is done in a similar manner to that of cases except that controls should exclude latent diagnoses of the phenotypes. It can be true that any loss of power occurred by selection of samples can be recovered by increasing the sample size However, the sample size of GWAS has cost constraints With large sample sizes of several thousands cases and controls there has been usually limited study power to detect alleles of modest effect sizes \(e.g., an odds ratio of 1.20  T hus  we s u gge s t t ha t  opt i m a l s e l e c t i on of both controls and cases for multivariate phenotypes can 180 mg/dl\ as a multivariate phenotype.

Introduction Genome-wide association studies \(GWAS\ have served crucial roles in investigating disease susceptible loci for single traits. On the other hand, the GWAS have been limited in measuring genetic risk factors for multivariate phenotypes from pleiotropic genetic effects of genetic loci. This work reports a data mining approach to discover patterns of multivariate phenotypes expressed as association rules, and present an analytical scheme for GWAS of those multivariate phenotypes as defining new phenotypes.

180 An association rule which expresses multivariate phenotypes encoding partial correlations between single traits specifies quantitative descriptions of the single traits. Association rules can provide explicit boundaries of the single traits to be used in selection of samples for cases and controls Compared with traditional approaches to GWAS, the use of the discovered multivariate phenotypes can take advantages of identifying genetic risk factor accounting for pleiotropic genetic effects when phenotypes have a common etiologic pathway  2.2 Discovery of multivariate phenotypes 2. Methods 2.1 Association Rule Mining Transformation GWAS Interpretation of Association Rules Preprocessing Data Y 792 100\ and high levels of triglyceride \(TG Each X and Y consists of a conjunction of distinct predicates which describe values of singleton traits. The strength of the association rules can be measured in terms of their support \(supp\ and confidence \(conf\.

We  Discretization of continuous traits improve the outcome of GWAS to explain disease predisposition In this work, we present the discovery of patterns of multivariate phenotypes by applying association rule mining to 46 biochemical traits in KARE \(Korea Association Resource\ population [8   In ad dition w e also show an analytical scheme for GWAS of the multivariate phenotypes.  As a case study, we describe the results of GWAS for low levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol \(LDL-C enerated Figure 1 Work flow diagram  Rules encoding lipid levels  e.g., low LDL-C and high TG 566 rules Y [c, s where X and Y are the body and the head of a rule respectively.

Hence we used discretization to manipulate continuous traits into nominal traits before the ARM process was executed. In this process, continuous traits are divided into five bins expressing extremely low, low, average, high extremely high values by using equal frequency rather than equal width discretization The most of the traits are normally distributed and tend to cluster around their means. Hence, if equal width discretization was applied, bins which include a small number of outliers having values above or below the mean are ignored from final results of association rules Therefore, equal frequency discretization was adopted in order to minimize loss of bins containing the outliers of extreme values of traits   The discovery of multivariate traits from single traits is transformed into finding frequent patterns in a set of singleton traits. In our approach we employed Association Rule Mining \(ARM\ discover a set of multivariate traits expressed as association rules describing associations among a set of singlet traits.  We have previously shown t ha t  a ss o c i a t i o n r ul e s detected by ARM are informative and quantitative and have benefits to interpret their meaning Association rules have the form R: X Y\e probability that a case in a database contains both X and Y. The  confidence of a rule is the probability that a case contains Y given that it contains X. Note that the head of a rule, Y, is restricted to be one of the traits which we are interested in and X is a set of traits partially correlated with Y. Interesting rules are manually extracted

We discovered patterns of multivariate phenotypes i.e phenotypic associations among biochemical traits in KARE using association rule mining. Multivariate phenotypes were expressed as association rules Association rules encoded associations between plasma levels of lipids including LDL-C and TG, HDL and non-HDL. The association rules discovered in our study are in good harmony with the result of numerous studies for CVD [6, 1  t h a t i ndi c a t e  ne ga t i ve  ge ne t i c  correlations between LDL-C and TG as well as between HDL and TG. The plasma lipid levels and relationships between them are well known risk factors for CVD We inferred that the association rules encoding lipids implied pleiotropic genetic effect on LDL \205C and TG This suggests that common genes contribute to the decrease in LDL-C and the increase in TG We showed an approach for GWAS of multivariate phenotypes in order to identify genetic loci influenced by phenotypic associations. Our approach to GWAS of multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG, i.e. low levels of LDL-C and high levels of TG, identified 13 SNPs in 4 genes \(CSMD1, NFE2L1, CBX1 and SKAP1 CSMD1 was reported in GWA study of Kawasaki Disease \(KD\ [1 c h i s an i n f l am m a tory vasculi tis affecting young children [1 a n d a s s oc i a t e d wi t h serious CVD sequela in adulthood. During analysis of functional relationships between eight KD susceptible loci, Burgner identified a single functional network which contained CSMD1. They asserted that KD susceptible loci may also be relevant to other CVD and functionally be related to inflammation and cardiovascular pathology The results of our work suggest that four genetic loci associated with multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG  can be influenced by pleiotropic effect on LDL-C and TG and be involved in genetic susceptibility to CVD The GWAS of multivariate phenotypes are an important alternative to traditional approaches of GWAS considering pleiotropic effects. This work is advantageous in identifying genetic variants associated with traits having a common etiology pathway     Hindo rff et a l 217 P otenti a l etiologic  and func tional implications of genome-wide association loci for human diseases and traits\220, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2009, 106 23\62-9367   Gibs on, G.: \217Hints of hidden heritability  in GW AS\220 Nat Genet, 42, \(7\558-560   M anolio T.A et. al: \217F inding th e m i ss ing her itability o f  complex diseases\220, Nature, 2009, 461, \(7265 747-753 4  Thom a s D.: \217Gene-envir onment-wid e as sociation studies: emerging approaches\220, Nat Rev Genet, 11, \(4 pp. 259-272 5  Yang, Q., e t a l 217Analy ze m u ltivar iate phe n o ty pes in genetic association studies by combining univariate association tests\220, Genet Epidemiol, 34, \(5\44-454 6  Edward s K.L e t  a l 217Pleiot ropic Genetic Ef fects on LDL Size, Plasma Triglyceride, and HDL Cholesterol in Families\220, Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 1999, 19, \(10 pp. 2456-2464  Klei, L., et. al: \217Ple iotropy a n d princip a l components  of heritability combine to increase power for association analysis\220, Genet Epidemiol, 2008, 32, \(1\-19 8  Ch o, Y.S et. al: \217A largescale genome-wide as sociation study of Asian populations uncovers genetic factors influencing eight quantitative traits\220, Nat Genet, 2009, 41 5\4 9  Park, S et al: \217Pr e d iction of protein-protein  interaction types using association rule based classification\220, BMC Bioinformatics, 2009, 10, \(1   Agrawal, R., and S r ikant, R.: \217Fas t Alg o rithm s for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\220, VLDB 1994, pp. 487 - 499  Purcell S, et. al: \217PLINK: a tools et for whole-genom e  association and population-based linkage analysis\220 American Journal of Human Genetics, 2007, 81  Nusbaum  C., et. al: \217DNA sequence and ana ly sis of human chromosome 8\220, Nature, 2006, 439, \(7074\pp 331-335  Cu i, Y., et. al: \217Non-High-Density  L i poprotein Cholesterol Level as a Predictor of Cardiovascular Disease Mortality\220, Arch Intern Med, 2001, 161, \(11 1413-1419  Hong et. al: \217Gene tic variations in ATP2B1, CSK ARSG and CSMD1 loci are related to blood pressure and/or hypertension in two Korean cohorts\220, J Hum Hypertens, 24, \(6  rgner D., et. a l  and Internation a l Kawasaki Diseas e  Genetics, C.: \217A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel and Functionally Related Susceptibility Loci for Kawasaki Disease\220, PLoS Genet, 2009, 5, \(1 pp. e1000319  Bu rns J  C., and Glod M a ry  P 217Kawasaki sy nd rome\220 The Lancet, 2004, 364, \(9433\33-544   Nock, N.L e t al: \217Def ining genetic deter m inants of t h e  Metabolic Syndrome in the Framingham Heart Study using association and structural equation modeling methods\220, BMC Proc, 2009, 3 Suppl 7, pp. S50   The KARE genotype and epidemiological data were gratefully made available by National Institute of Health Korea Center for Disease Control, which supported this work through the KARE Analysis Consortium.

Looking at j S k i  S k j j we can write Pr j S k i  S k j j\000j S i  S j j  2 024 j 024 016 j S i  S j j  2 024  024 2 001 e 000 j S i  S j j 016 2 6 024 2 We use the fact that Chernoff bounds also holds for negatively dependent random variables Since the last bound is the weakest of the three the lemma follows We want GP i;j to hold with probability 1 000 o 1 n 2  whenever items i and j both have support   From Lemma 6 we get that this holds if j S i  S j j  C\024 log n  for some constant C depending on 016  If s  i j   2 024Lf     025 024L then j S i  S j j 025 2 024L  Hence a suf\002cient condition for the similarity is s  i j   024L  3 It remains to understand what is the probability that given a good permutation the pair sampler will take a number of samples for a given pair in each chunk k that leads to a 1 006 016  approximation of s  i j   We denote the latter event by GBS i;j;k  and want to bound the quantity Pr[GBS i;j;k j GP i;j   For this purpose consider the random variable X i;j;k de\002ned as the number of times we sample the pair f i j g in chunk k  Assuming GP i;j we have that over the randomness in the pair sampling algorithm E  X i;j;k  016;L   f  j S 1 i j  j S 1 j j  034 j S i  S j j  2 024  Since the occurrences of f i j g are independently sampled we can apply a Chernoff bound to conclude X i;j;k 016;L  E  X i;j;k   This leads to the conclusion Lemma 7 X i;j;k 016;L   f  j S 1 i j  j S 1 j j  034 j S i  S j j  2 024 016 Suppose that X i;j;k is close to its expectation Then we can use it with 1 006 016  approximations of j S i j and j S j j  to compute a 1 006 O  016  approximation of s  i j   This follows by analysis of the concrete functions f of the measures in Figure 1 A suf\002cient condition on the similarity needed for a 1 006 016  approximation of X i;j;k can be inferred from lemma 7 If s  i j  025 4 024L=\034 then E  X i;j;k  025 s  i j  034  4 024 025 L  So it suf\002ces to enforce s  i j  025 4 024L=\034  4 In order to have O  mb  pairs produced by the pair sampling phase we will choose 034  4 M  The expected number of pair samples from T t is less than j T t j 2 034 f      using that f is decreasing For all measures we consider f     024 1   so j T t j 2 034 f     024 j T t j 2 M 024 j T t j  It remains to understand which is the probability that a pair of items each with support at least   is not sampled by SampleCount Let the random variable X k represent the total number of samples taken in chunk k  The probability that a f i j g is sampled in chunk k is X i;j;k X k  so the probability that it does not get sampled in any evennumbered chunk is Q k 2  024 even  1 000 X i;j;k X k  s  We have seen before that X i;j;k 016;L 025 s  i j  034  4 024  For what concerns X k using a Chernoff bound we can get X k 016;L  E  X k  024 mb=\024  using the linear upper bound on the number of samples So we can compute Y k 2  024 even  1 000 X i;j;k X k  s 024 022 1 000 s  i j  034 024 2 024\015 i;j mb 023 s\024 2 024 022 1 000 s  i j  034 4 mb 023 s\024 2 024 C exp 024 000 s  i j  034 s\024 8 mb 025 In order for this probability to be small enough  O 1 m 2   we need to bound the similarity to s  i j  025 8 mbL s\024\034 5 To choose the best value of 024 we balance constraints 3 and 5 getting 024L   mbL s\024\034  024  r mbM s 6 From which we can deduce s  i j   L  max  r mbM s  M   7 V D ATASET CHARACTERISTICS We have computed for a selection of the datasets hosted on the FIMI web page 1  the ratios between the number of occurrences of single items and pairs in the 002rst half of the transactions and the total number of occurrences of the same items or pairs The values of some of this ratios the most representative are plotted 002gure 3 on the x axis items or pairs are spread evenly after they have been sorted according to their associated ratio The y axis represents the value of the ratios We have taken into account only items and pairs whose support is over 20 occurrences in the whole dataset in order to avoid the noise that could be generated by very rare elements As we can see the number of occurrences and co-occurrences are not so far from what would be expected under a random permutation of the transactions The synthetic data set behaves exactly like we would expect under a random permutation with the ratio being very close to 1  2 for almost all items/pairs This means that even for real data sets where the order of transactions is not random the sampling probabilities used in the pair sampling are reasonably close to the ones that would be obtained under the random permutation assumption VI C ONCLUSIONS We presented the 002rst study concerning the problem of mining similar pairs from a stream of transactions that does rely on the similarity of items and not only on the frequency of pairs A thorough experimental study of carefully engineered versions of the presented algorithm remains to be carried out 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
