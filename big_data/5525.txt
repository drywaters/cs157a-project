INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of information technology data that people have dramatically increased. How to extract some valuable information from a large number of random data has become an important research topic, thus driving the emergence and rapid development of data mining technology. Data mining is a technology can intelligently and automatically transform the data into useful information and knowledge, which can not only help people extract the interested knowledge, law, or a higher level information from the database, particularly the relevant data of the data warehouses, but also help people analyze them from different angles, thus to more efficiently use data 1 It not only can be used to describe the development of the past data, but also can further predict the future trends, so data mining is becoming a new hot research area which is increasingly concerned Association rule mining is a very important research topic in data mining field, is important content of knowledge discovery technology research. With the data accumulation many of the industry are more and more interested for mining association rules from their databases. Association rule mining algorithm is the main content of association rule mining research. A typical association rule mining algorithm is Apriori algorithm, the rest are mostly based on Apriori algorithm, or its variants, or its expansion. Apriori algorithm 


needs to scan the original database for many times in the mining process, and generate a large number of candidate item sets, so there are low mining efficiency, too large occupied memory space and other deficiencies, needs further study II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM Apriori algorithm is the most widely used algorithm in association rules. Association rules mining is proposed when analyzing the retail transaction databases, the current development has greatly exceeded the original scope of application, the depth and breadth have been greatly enhanced. The basic model of association rule mining is shown in figure 1  Figure 1. Basic model of association rule mining A. Apriori Algorithm idea In order to reduce the number of candidate data item sets Apriori algorithm uses layer search method, and through scanning all the transaction data items of the database D to find the frequent item sets. From the features of frequent item sets it can be known that only the superset composed by those candidate sets which have been confirmed as frequent items may be frequent item set ]6[ . Therefore, only to use frequent item sets to generate the candidate set for next scan that is, using Li-1 to generate Ci, in which, L is the set of frequent item sets, C is the set of candidate items, and i is the times of current database scanning, each database scan only considers the set with the same number of data items. Apriori algorithm can generate a relatively small candidate data item sets, the candidate data item set does not have to be repeatedly generated according to the records in the database but generated by the k-1 frequent data item set which is generated by the last circulation in the process of seeking for k frequent data item sets, Apriori algorithm implementation process as shown in figure 2 2010 2nd International Conference on Software Technology and Engineering\(ICSTE V2-362C978-1-4244-8666-3/10/$26.00      2010 IEEE  Figure 2. Apriori algorithm implementation process B. Apriori algorithm performance analysis Apriori algorithm based on frequent item set uses layer search iterative method, the algorithm is simple ]4[ , no 


complicated theoretical derivation, easy to implement. But it also has some shortcomings difficult to overcome 1 algorithm scanning, each generating a candidate item set, it must carry out a comprehensive database search. If you want to generate a frequent item set with maximum length k, then the database should be scanned for K times. When the database storing a large number of transaction data, in the limited memory capacity, the system I/O load is very large each scan will be a very long time ]5[ , so the efficiency will be very low. Secondly, Apriori algorithm also may generate a lot of candidate item sets 2 computing time will be significantly increased, and the affairs supported this frequent item set will be reduced. In theory, the time required to calculate its support will not be significantly increased, but the Apriori Algorithm is still in the original transaction database to calculate the support of the frequent item set, because the items of each frequent item set changed to be more, so the spending to determine whether each frequent item set is supported by the transaction is also increased, but the services have not decreased, so when the length of frequent item set increases the computing time is increased significantly 3 difference of the various attribute importance levels. In real life, some services are very frequent occurred, while some services are very sparse, thus for mining there is a problem: if the minimum support threshold is set too high, though accelerated ]3[ , but such a large number of rules without practical significance will fill in the whole data mining process, which will greatly reduce the efficiency of mining and the availability of the rules. This will mislead decision making III. APRIORI MINING ALGORITHM IMPROVEMENT Despite the Apriori algorithm can prune for the large number of candidate sets, but in large transaction databases there still may be a large number of candidate sets need to be processed, and this operation takes a long time. On the other hand, Apriori algorithm needs to repeatedly scan the database to calculate the support of the candidate set, then generate a new candidate set with the length of 1 increased, Aprinri 


algorithms is tedious, especially when there is a long pattern ]2[ . Based on the above analysis, this paper proposes an optimization strategy to further reduce the number of candidate items in the candidate item set Ck. In the Apriori algorithm, Ck-1 is compared with the support after its generation, the item sets less than the support will be cut, to generate Lk-1 which will be connected with the Ck-1 to generate Ck. The improved algorithm is to further cut for Lk-1 before the generation of candidate item set Ck, and account for the times all the items in Lk-1 occurred, and delete the item sets which contains the items with occurrence times less than k-1 in the Lk-1, to reduce the number of k-1 item sets participated in the connection, thus to reduce the number of candidate items in Ck. The improved Apriori algorithm implementation process is shown in figure 3  Figure 3. Improved Apriori algorithm implementation process 2010 2nd International Conference on Software Technology and Engineering\(ICSTE V2-363 IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS A. Experimental results In order to compare performance difference of the two algorithms in large amounts of data, the experimental test data is the data set randomly generated, the random number of items to 256, test data is randomly generated record number, which is 50000, 90000 and 150000. And then using the same minimum support threshold 0.03, 0.05 to test, and record the time required to generate the frequent item sets, to compare with the implementation efficiency of the traditional algorithm and the optimization algorithm, the results as shown in table 1 TABLE I.

Experimental results analysis From the above results it can be seen, when the experimental data is not too much, the implementation efficiency of the improved algorithm is close to the traditional Apriori algorithm, but with the increasing amount of experimental data, the implementation efficiency of the improved algorithm is significantly better than the ordinary Apriori algorithm. This is because that the optimization algorithm has made further cutting for Lk-1 before considering the combination of candidate item set Ck, that is made a count processing for the frequent item set Lk-1 to be involved in the connection ]7[ , and then according to the count results to delete the item set which contains the items with a number of occurrences less than k-1 in Lk-1, thus to reduce the number of k-1 item sets to participate in the connection, to exclude some element do not meet the combination conditions, to reduce the possibility of combination and the number of candidate items in Ck, that is to reduce the number of cycle and judgment. For a large database, this reduction of time cost is obvious in data mining efficiency V. CONCLUSION Data mining technology is mainly used to deal with massive data information, to find hidden, potential meaningful knowledge. Association rule mining algorithms requires to frequently access to the database, which makes the algorithm time complexity high, efficiency low, has become a bottleneck of association rule mining algorithm development. In this paper, through in-depth study of the existing Apriori algorithm and its improved algorithm, an Apriori algorithm optimization program is proposed, and the experimental results show that this optimization program is

158 


 WRAcc  now also perform signi田antly better than Con電ence and Speci田ity is now additionally outperformed by the F-measure and WRAcc while it no longer performs signi田antly better than Purity Finally Correlation signi田antly outperforms Con電ence Obviously some measures might be better than others in distinguishing the top k subgroups from false discoveries when k 1  while others might be better when k  100  The observed changes are not very dramatic and we consider the selection of k a user-derived parameter in the method One of the signi田ant relations that seems somewhat peculiar is the result that for both k 1 and k  100  Con電ence performs signi田antly better than Purity while the latter is de渡ed to be max  Con電ence  1  Con電ence   While there is a good theoretical reason to consider the Purity of a subgroup we can see from the de渡ition that Purity has a lower bound of 0  5  hence the random baseline will generate higher values with Purity than with Con電ence Apparently the quality of the subgroups found with Purity does not increase enough compared to those found with Con電ence to compensate for this effect By comparing the second and third columns of Table III with the last two columns we can see that  WRAcc   WRAcc and particularly Purity perform better when we restrict the tests to datasets with a binary target These measures bene鍍 from the fact that in these test cases we have a better balance between positive and negative examples in the data compared to test cases on other datasets We can also read from the table that we have fewer measures that are signi田antly better than others on datasets with a binary target This is mainly because because signi田ance is hard to achieve in an experiment with only 18 test cases as opposed to 85 or 78 on all datasets With 18 test cases the critical difference for the Nemenyi test with signi田ance level 002 1 is CD 4  496  rather than CD 2  069 with 85 test cases Since the average ranks range from 1 to 12  a critical difference of 4  496 is substantial More signi田ant differences between the quality measures can be expected when tested on more datasets with a binary target The results for the EMM variant were generated on a modest number of test cases As a result the critical difference for the Nemenyi test is quite high and one could not expect to nd many signi田ant results Expensive experimentation may give a signi田ant reason to prefer one measure over another in this setting For now what matters is that this illustrates that our method is applicable in more general settings than just traditional subgroup discovery VII C ONCLUSIONS We propose a method that deals with the multiple comparisons problem in subgroup discovery i.e the problem that when exploring a vast search space one basically considers many candidates for a statistical hypothesis hence one will inevitably incorrectly label some candidates as passing the test Our method tackles this problem by building a statistical model for the false discoveries the Distribution of False Discoveries DFD This distribution is generated by given a dataset and quality measure repeatedly running a subgroup discovery algorithm on a swap-randomized version of the data In this swap-randomized version while the distribution of the target variable is maintained its correlation with the attributes is destroyed Hence the best subgroup discovered on this dataset represents a false discovery The DFD is then determined by applying the central limit theorem to the qualities of these false discoveries Having determined the DFD one can solve many practical problems prevalent in subgroup discovery For any given discovered subgroup one can determine a p-value corresponding to the null hypothesis that it is generated by the DFD refuting this null hypothesis implies that the subgroup is not a false discovery Given a set of quality measures one can use the DFD to determine which quality measures are better than others in distinguishing the top k subgroups from false discoveries This gives an objective criterion for selecting a quality measure that is more likely to produce exceptional results Finally given some desired signi田ance level 002  one could extract from the DFD a minimum threshold for the quality measure at hand When validating single subgroups we see that our method removes insigni田ant subgroups found on datasets that have few numeric attributes From metalearning we nd that on large datasets for instance with more than ve numeric attributes the random baseline is more likely to accept many patterns This is reasonable because of the associated larger hypothesis space Table II shows that our method can remove insigin田ant subgroups on some of the datasets with more than ve numeric attributes but not on all of them When we validate quality measures we have outlined that the method we described determines the extent to which a quality measure is also an exceptionality measure We have seen that of the twelve measures for subgroup discovery we tested 006 2 is the best exceptionality measure and Purity and Sensitivity are by far the worst For the EMM correlation model variant no signi田ant conclusions can be drawn from the modest experiments In this paper we have presented a technique making extensive use of swap randomization Notice that we do not by any means claim to have invented this particular randomization method Also its use in step I of the method we introduced in this paper is not the only option available We have extensively explained why using swap randomized data leads to a good model for false discoveries but it comes at a price for every result of a subgroup discovery run one wishes to validate one has to run the same subgroup discovery algorithm an additional m times where m needs to be large enough to satisfy the constraints of the Central Limit Theorem In the more traditional subgroup discovery setting one can usually afford this extra computation time 
159 


For more complex settings for instance the EMM variant using Bayesian networks introduced in this becomes problematic When computation time becomes an issue one might consider different randomization techniques to generate R 1 R m  for instance by simply drawing a random sample from 002 of a certain size for each R i  Before such a technique can be employed its theoretical rami田ations need to be explored In future work we also plan to empirically investigate the effect of certain parameters on the outcome of the method A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is nancially supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scienti田 Research NWO under project number 612  065  822 Exceptional Model Mining R EFERENCES  J Friedman N Fisher  Bump-Hunting in High-Dimensional Data Statistics and Computing 9\(2 pp 123143 1999  W  Kl  osgen Subgroup Discovery Handbook of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery ch 16.3 Oxford University Press New York 2002  S D Bay  M J P azzani Detecting group dif ferences Mining contrast sets Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 5\(2 pp 213246 2001  G Dong J Li Ef cient mining of emer ging patterns Discovering trends and differences Proc KDD pp 4352 1999  P  Kralj No v a k N La vra 031 c G I Webb Supervised Descriptive Rule Discovery A Unifying Survey of Contrast Set Emerging Pattern and Subgroup Mining Journal of Machine Learning Research 10 pp 377403 2009  Y  Hochber g A T amhane Multiple Comparison Procedures Wiley New York 1987  J F  urnkranz P A Flach ROC n Rule Learning  Towards a Better Understanding of Covering Algorithms Machine Learning 58 1 pp 39-77 2005  N La vra 031 c P Flach B Kav 031 sek and L Todorovski Rule induction for subgroup discovery with CN2-SD Proc ECML/PKDD 2002  H Grosskreutz Cascaded subgroups disco v ery with an application to regression Proc ECML/PKDD 2008  B F  I Pieters A Knobbe S D 031 zeroski Subgroup Discovery in Ranked Data with an Application to Gene Set Enrichment Proc Preference Learning workshop PL2010 at ECML PKDD 2010  W  Dui v esteijn A Knobbe A Feelders M v an Leeuwen Subgroup Discovery meets Bayesian networks an Exceptional Model Mining approach Proc ICDM pp 158167 2010  D Leman A Feelders A Knobbe Exceptional Model Mining Proc ECML/PKDD Part II pp 116 2008  Y  H Xu A Fern On Learning Linear Ranking Functions for Beam Search Proc ICML 2007 ACM International Conference Proceeding Series vol 227 pp 10471054 ACM New York  H Grosskreutz S R  uping On Subgroup Discovery in Numerical Domains Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 19\(2 pp 210226 2009  A Gionis H Mannila T  Mielik  ainen P Tsarapas Assessing data mining results via swap randomization Proc KDD pp 167176  2006  A M L yapuno v  Nouv elle forme du th  eor  eme sur la limite de probabilit  e St Petersburg 1901  K Pearson L Filon Mathematical contrib utions to the theory of evolution iv on the probable errors of frequency constants and on the in盃ence of random selection on variation and correlation Phil Trans A 191 pp 229311 1898  J Dem 031 sar Statistical Comparisons of Classi兎rs over Multiple Data Sets Journal of Machine Learning Research 7 pp 130 2006  M Friedman The use of ranks to a v oid the assumption of normality implicit in the analysis of variance Journal of the American Statistical Association 32 pp 675701 1937  M Friedman A comparison of alternati v e tests of signi田ance for the problem of m rankings Annals of Mathematical Statistics 11 pp 8692 1940  P  B Nemen yi Distrib ution-free multiple comparisons PhD thesis Princeton University 1963  M Ojala G C Garriga A Gionis H Mannila Ev aluating Query Result Signi田ance in Databases via Randomizations Proc SDM pp 906917 2010  N Me giddo R Srikant Disco v ering Predicti v e Association Rules Proc KDD pp 274278 1998  W  Kl  osgen Explora A multipattern and multistrategy discovery assistent Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining pp 249-271 1996  C Silv erstein S Brin R Motw ani Be yond Mark et Bask ets Generalizing Association Rules to Dependence Rules Data Min Knowl Discov 2 1 pp 3968 1998  P N T an V  K umar  J Sri v asta v a Selecting the right inter estingness measure for association patterns Proc KDD pp 3241 2002  G I W ebb Disco v ering Signi田ant P atterns Machine Learning 68 1 pp 133 2007  M Meeng A J Knobbe Fle xible Enrichment with Cortana  Software Demo Proc Benelearn pp 117119 2011  D Ne wman S Hettich C Blak e C Merz UCI repository of machine learning databases 1998

cc ur ac y   Fig. 4. Accuracy for Model-based clustering and rule-based classification Fig. 5. Distribution of flow attributes in scatter plot matrix In Fig.5, the distribution of IP and ports for source and destination is depicted for Model-based clustering method. For HTTP \(blue traffic to few destination IPs. HTTP behavior is prominent because a number of source hosts are communicating with small number of destination hosts, i.e., HTTP servers. In DNS application, source hosts communicate with a set of DNS servers. Each host interacts with different domains such as www, .org and .net for resolving IP addresses. The DNS behavior is prominent because large group of source hosts communicate with small repeated set of destination IPs. In the IRC application, a group of hosts communicates with other group of hosts. There is roughly one-to-one correspondence between source and destination IP. This behavior is prominent because IRC \(cross with approximately equal number of destination IPs. Moreover, source IP and destination port distribution show that destination port numbers are in the range of 30000 for SMTP green where as HTTP and MAIL have destination ports number in lower range of 1000. Model-based clustering with the Apriori algorithm provides reliable and accurate classification model as compared to K-mean method. The association rules helps us predict flows for particular application with high confidence and lift values IV. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have presented a classification model that achieves high flow classification accuracy with application behavior profiling. The use of the K-mean algorithm for Netflow classification was shown to be inefficient. On the other hand, Model based clustering with association rule mining techniques provided a much better accuracy. Moreover the rule heuristics are produced automatically, making the algorithm modular and independent of the dataset. In addition 


our model is able to detect new behavior patterns for next generation applications.

denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
