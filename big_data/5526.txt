R ELATED WORKS  Currently, association rules mining [1 cl ust er  2  correspondence analysis [3  etc  a r e  da ta m i n i n g m e th od s  commonly used to discover prescription compatibility principle. Furthermore, several improved algorithms based on association rules mining have emer A  prescriptions data mining system integrated data preprocessing, high frequent item sets and association rules mining, cluster, classification etc. is developed in project DartGrid [5, 6 N ew res ear ch  w a y is ex plor e d  bec au s e of th e  application of methods above for prescriptions compatibility principle mining, which is becoming one of the most important research directions for the interdisciplinary research of TCM in union with computer technology gradually Algorithm CMAR \(Classification based on Multiple Association Rules\based on FP-growth method is proposed in 2001 [7  T h e obj e c t i v e  o f a l g o ri t h m CM AR i s t o s o l v e the problem of classification through mining classification association rules. But it is assumed that decision attributes or category attribute\ are closely related any conditional attributes \(the attributes except decision attributes\ in algorithm CMAR. Higher memory cost and running time will be spend when super high dimension data set such as prescriptions data sets of TCM with hundreds dimensions is processed. The assumption above causes that irrelative attributes exist in mined classification association rules. So the index of IF * ICF \(the inverse class frequency\ is proposed in paper [8  w h ich is u s e d t o d e le te th e att ri b u t es  with higher frequent but lower contribution for classification from VCFP-Tree in order to improved the performance of algorithm. The index of IF * ICF usually is useless When the classification number is lower so that a Chinese medicine has appeared in each type of prescription. The method of feature selection based on information gain is introduced in algorithm CMAR. A classification association rules mining algorithm CARM-IG for TCM prescription high dimension data set is established, which can reduce the time and space cost, and mine classification association rules with higher quality through the deletion of irrelevant Chinese medicines Abstract On Classification Compatibility Laws of Zhongjing Prescriptions 204Zhongjing prescriptions are selected as data set in this paper. First, a classification association rules mining algorithm, which selected features based on information gain short for CARM-IG, is achieved. The algorithm is used to mine compatibility laws of Zhang Zhongjing from cold-heat deficiency-excess in eight principals of TCM \(Traditional Chinese Medicine\ Second, 21 rules which are applied to the treatment of cold, heat or cold-heat mixing syndromes are mined. And 29 rules which are applied to the treatment of deficiency, excess or deficiency-excess mixing syndromes are discovered too. The reduction of  run time and memory cost of algorithm CARM-IG had been proved, at the same time, the concision and precision of classification compatibility laws are guaranteed because of the deletion of irrelevant Chinese medicines with classification. Finally, the compatibility laws of Zhang Zhongjing are listed in this paper, which would be used to direct clinical practice sometimes I Keywords-prescription compatibility laws of Zhang Zhongjing;  classification association rules;  features selection   Xuemei Yang, Xinmei Lai, Candong Li Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Fuzhou, China e-mail: yxm_wj@sina.com, xm9709@163.com, fjzylcd@126.com   I NTRODUCTION  Zhongjing prescriptions, which are created by Zhang Zhongjing, have experienced approximately two thousand years of Clinical verification. The prescriptions are commended by the later generation as classical prescriptions because of strict compatibility and remarkable treatment result. Over the years, Zhongjing prescription research is more confined to personal summary about compatibility principle, clinical research, experimental study, classification of prescription etc. Zhongjing prescriptions have not been collected completely to establish a database, and mathematical, statistical and data mining methods have not been used to sum up compatibility principle of Zhongjing prescriptions objectively so far Then, 268 prescriptions from \215Shang Han Lun\216 and \215Jin Kui Yao Lue\216 which are written by Zhang Zhongjing are selected from the prescription database of TCM information system through excluding duplicate prescriptions and deleting prescriptions without medicine in order to establish data set of Zhongjing prescription in this research firstly Then Zhongjing prescriptions are classified by experts in the TCM field from two dimensions of cold-heat and deficiencyexcess in eight principles. Finally, a classification association rules mining algorithm based on information gain feature selection CARM-IG is applied to mining latent compatibility principles of Zhang Zhongjing, so that the compatibility principles of Zhang Zhongjing for the treatment of cold syndrome, heat syndrome, deficiency syndrome and excess syndrome etc. can be summed up objectively  II

Finally, the compatibility principles of Zhongjing prescriptions are summed up from different dimensions of classification III   Figure 1 I F EATURE SELECTION BASED ON INFORMATION GAIN  The basic idea behind feature selection is to compute some measure that is used to quantify the relevance between an attribute and a given class label. Information gain is one of effective measures for feature selection. Such a measure is referred to as an attribute selection measure or a measure of the goodness of split. Information gain is defined as the difference of the expect information needed to classify a give sample 1    C LASSIFICATION ASSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON INFORMATION GAIN FEATURE SELECTION   mj i ss ss CIss s mj A P RESCRIPTION DATA SET T 2 1 1 1 0 0 B 4 1 1 0 1 0 C mj     ss p p ss 212 GC where Sj contains those samples in S that have value cj of C. Let sij be the number of sample of class Di in a subset Sj. The entropy, or expected information based on the partitioning into subsets by C, is given by  below, Chinese medicines usually is designated as attributes of prescriptions data set such as a and b etc. Whether a Chinese medicine appears in a prescription is been indicated by 0 or 1. Classification attributes often list in the end, such as classification tag. A VCFP-Tree \(i.e., figure 1\ is constructed based on the data set T. The order of items in the frequent-item header table Flist is a: 4-b: 3-c: 3-d: 3 with 3 as the threshold of support count. The information stored in the node indicated by deep color arrow is that there is one prescription containing Chinese medicines abd and belonging to class C TABLE I and the greater the purity of the subset partitions, and the higher the correlation between conditional attributes and decision attributes. The lowest threshold of information gain is usually been set, and the attributes whose information gain value is higher than the threshold will be chosen as the distinguish attributes for classification. The threshold of information gain is set to 0.1 in this research refer book IV Attribute C can be used to partition S into v subsets and the expect information needed to classify a give sample based on conditional attributes  a b c d E classification tag 5 1 1 1 1 0 C is defined as 2 1 log   1 1 0 1 0 1 A 3 0 0 0 1 1 A  212 001      212 001 GC I s s EC  I I ij ij j Variant of Classification Frequent Pattern Tree m E C m m mii i v cc v SS v jmj j E j s s s j I m ij ij i pp E C I acts as the weight of the jth subset and is the number of samples in the subset divided by the total number of samples in S 1    No s p S 1  1  1 1 1       1         Specific definition is given by 1        1 Let S be a set consisting of s data samples. Suppose the class label attribute has m distinct values defining m distinct classes Di \(for i=1,\203, m \t si be the number of samples of S in class Di. The expect information needed to classify a give sample is given by 12 1    log   the greater the information gain value  is the probability that a sample in Sj belongs to class Di Anyway, the smaller the entropy value  A variant of classification frequent pattern tree \(VCFPTree\ is a compress storage structure of data set in order to mine classification association rules without candidate frequent item sets generation. A VCFP-Tree must satisfy condition below [9  1. A VCFP-Tree consists of one root labeled as "null", a set of item prefix subtrees as the children of the root, and a frequent-item header table F-list 2. Each node in the item prefix subtree consists of five fields: item, child-link, parent-link, node-link, and class-list where item registers which item this node represents, childlink links to child nodes of each node, parent-link links to parent node of each node, node-link links to the next node in the VCFP-Tree carrying the same item, or null if there is none, and class-list is a classification list which records every class label and its corresponding frequency 3. Each entry in the frequent-item header list consists of three fields, \(1\tem-name; \(2\tart of node-link, which points to the first node in the VCFP-Tree carrying the same item; \(3\ information gain value of the attribute As shown in table    001 VCFP-Tree based on data set T  


D Input Class association rule is an implication of the form R: C Classification Association Rule End Algorithm CAR is the rule rear piece. The support count indicates the frequency of three Chinese medicines above appearing in a same prescription and treating cold syndrome, and is also called the frequency of rule; the frequency of rule former piece indicates the frequency of three Chinese medicines above appearing in a same prescription. There are 268 prescriptions in Zhongjing prescriptions. So the rule support is 0.056, which is computed through support count 15 divided by 268. The rule confidence is 60%, which is computed through support count 15 divided by the frequency of rule former piece 25 Algorithm CARM-IG scans Zhongjing prescription database firstly. The frequency D, where C for every Chinese medicine The concrete steps of algorithm CARM-IG which are used to mine classification association rule effectively are as following CARM-IG the frequency the set of classification association rules and  is used to computer  ss sup\(R  f f f f I f f f Begin   min_IG: the lowest threshold of information gain min_conf: the lowest threshold of confidence B  4\R=CFP-growth \(T, min_sup, min_conf 5\ Return \(CAR min_conf. C indicates conditional attribute \(or item indicates decision attribute \(or classification attribute\. Sup R\ is the support of rule R, min_sup is the lowest threshold of support; Conf \(R\s the confidence of rule R, min_conf is the lowest threshold of confidence. The support and confidence of rule R is defined below Sup \(R\= P \(C\001D\                           \(4 Conf \(R\= P \(D|C\                            \(5 P \(C\001D\dicates the joint probability of C and D. P D|C\dicates the conditional probability that belongs to class D under the condition of Chinese medicine C appearance. Rule support and confidence are two important measures of rule interestingness. They respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of discovered rules. The rules with higher support and confidence are usually chosen as interesting pattern For example Ramulus Cinnamomi *  Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens Radix Paeoniae Alba are recorded so that information gain value IG of every conditional attribute can be computed according to \(1\ The conditional attributes \(or Chinese medicines\ith cold syndrome Support count=15, frequency of rule former piece=25 Where {Ramulus Cinnamomi * Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens * Radix Paeoniae Alba} before x x x yx yx for each type of prescription containing Chinese medicine for each type of prescription and the frequency  descending. The objective of the second scan of prescription data set is to create a compress storage structure for Zhongjing prescription, namely a VCFP-Tree T. Finally, the algorithm of CFP-growth \(Class-Frequent Pattern growth\ is achieved as following [7 1. Based on F-list in Figure 1, the set of class-association rules can be divided into subsets without overlap: \(1\ the ones having d; \(2\he ones having c, but no d; \(3\ the ones having b, but no d  nor c ; and \(4\ the ones having only a. So algorithm CARM-IG finds these subsets of class-association rules one by one 2. To find the subset of rules having d, algorithm CARMIG traverses nodes having attribute value d and look 215upward\216 to collect a d-projected database, which contains a,b,c,d\:C; \(a,b,d\; d:A} three tuples. It contains all the tuples having d. The problem of finding all frequent patterns having d in the whole training set can be reduced to mine frequent patterns in d-projected database 3. Recursively, in d-projected database, a and b are the frequent attribute values, i.e., they pass support threshold. \(In d-projected database, d happens in every tuple and thus is trivially frequent. We do not count d as a local frequent attribute value.\e can mine the projected database recursively by constructing VCFP-trees and projected databases. Please see [1 for m o r e d e t a ils  4. It happens that, in d-projected database, a and b always happen together and thus ab is a frequent pattern. a and b are two subpatterns of ab and have same support count as ab. To avoid triviality, we only adopt frequent pattern abd. Based on the class label distribution information, we generate rule abd is used to compute 1    Output is the rule former piece; {cold syndrome } after C with support count 2 and confidence 100 5. After search for rules having d, all nodes of d are merged into their parent nodes, respectively. That is, the class label information registered in a d node is registered in its parent node. The VCFP-tree is shrunk as shown in figure 2. Please note that this tree-shrinking operation is done at the same scan of collecting the d-projected min_sup: the lowest threshold of support C i x i j y j i x i j y m j i E C i i min_sup, and conf \(R min_sup and IG>min_IG are chosen. The header table F-list is constructed in accordance with Efficient Mining of Classification Association Rules based on Information gain Feature Selection 1\cans Zhongjing prescription database once. The information of relevant frequencies is recorded, so that the information gain value of every conditional attribute can been computed completely 2\onditional attributes which are higher than min_sup and min_IG are selected. The frequent-item header table Flist is constructed in attributes support descending order 3\ Scans Zhongjing prescription database second, and a VCFP-Tree T is constructed according to section

   Table 4. Normalized Criteria Comparison Table In AHP   Reusability Meeting Operational Requirements Meeting project Deadline Reusability 0.157 0.148 0.272 Meeting Operational Requirements 0.789 0.744 0.636 Meeting Project Deadline 0.052 0.106 0.090  Table 3 and Table 4 show the weight values of the three criterions as compared to each other using the AHP process. These weights have been decided by the stakeholders after discussions among themselves Average weights can be derived from Table 4 as follows Reusability- 0.193 Meeting Operational Requirements- 0.724 Meeting Project Deadline- 0.083 These weights represent the priority of each criterion on a scale of 0 to 1  5.3. Argumentation Tree  We develop argumentation tree for each and every alternative separately. The ar guments are stated by stake holders and assembled under the alternative but they target a specific cr iterion. These arguments can either be supporting or attacking each other or their respective alternative nodes. We present three figures, where each figure represents the argumentation hierarchy for one alternative. Rectangular boxes represent the alternatives with the name of the alternative under it. Ovals represent the criteria with their descr iption. The arguments are specified by labels èAê, èBê, èCê for alternative çAdobe flashé, çAdobe Directoré and çOpen GLé respectively Along with the labels, the arguments also have indexes associated with them. Beneath the labels are two boxes The box on left shows the weight of the argument whereas the box on right shows the priority of the stakeholder who specifies the argument  Once the argument has been sp ecified, the user enters its weight. We first reassess the weights of the arguments using priority reassessment discussed in h e n us ing the techniques specified in [11 w e red u ce t h e arg u m e n t s  to a single level. Finally, the weighted summation of the arguments with the criteria weights helps us evaluate the final weights for the decision matrix. It is important to note here that, the aggregation method used for calculating the favorability is a weighted summation  The three argumentation hierarchies for the three alternatives are presented in the Figures 7, 8, and 9. The diagrams contain arguments, their weights and the stakeholderês priorities     Figure 7. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Flash   Figure 8. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Director 150 


     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
