The proposed online system belongs to anomaly detection, not misuse detection. Moreover, a mechanism for dynamic firewall updating is embedded in the proposed system for the function of eliminating suspicious connections when necessary

Usually, effectiveness is measured by detection rate, false alarm rate, etc., and efficiency is measured by response time when an attack has occurred Much research into anomaly NI DS has evaluated the proposed 
approach by KDD CUP99 TCPDUMP datasets  whi c h  meant that the research was desi gned for offline use and, thus could not meet the real-time char acteristic of a NIDS. This was because the 41 features pr esented in KDD CUP99 are complicated and varied [8 e first 9 are intrinsic features which describe the basic features of individual TCP connections and can be obtained from raw TCPDUMP files features 10 to 22 are conten t-based features obtained by examining the data portion of a connection and suggested by domain knowledge; features 23 to 31 are traffic-based features computed using a two-second time window \(ìtime-based while features 32 to 41 are also traffic-based features, but computed using a window of 100 connections \(ìhost-based 
In this paper, the proposed online system is an anomaly NIDS which can detect and respond to flooding attacks in realtime. It is based on a genetically optimized incremental mining algorithm for fuzzy association ru les. That is, we focus on how to create an anomaly NIDS, based on genetic optimized mining of fuzzy association rules, wh ich can detect and react to a flooding attack in real-time. In contrast to traditional static mining for NIDS designs [1, 2, 3, 4 whi c h can o n l y be applied to offline NIDS, this system was designed based on an incremental mining approach, which enables the system to make a decision per time unit. In addition, a genetic algorithm was applied to help select the best membership functions for the fuzzy variables of mining. Consequently the performance 
of the proposed response system can be improved The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents background knowledge, including fuzzy association rules and membership functions; Section 3 introduces the genetically op timized incremental mining algorithm for fuzzy association ru les; Section 4 describes the online response system proposed by this research; Section 5 provides experimental results; and Section 6 presents our conclusions  II  R ELATED W ORKS  Fuzzy association rules have b een receiving a great deal of attention recently, and have had ma ny applications in different

percentage of records in D that contain X 000  Y is s and has confidence  c if the ratio of the number of records in D that contain X 000  Y to the number of records in D that contain X is c  Since the Apriori algorithm was designed for mining in databases with binary items, fuzzy association rules mining [13 14 has be en one o f t h e vari at i ons whi c h has deal t wi t h  quantitative items While applying fuzzy association rules to an IDS \(intrusion detection system\ design, the term item, is replaced by the term feature, and thus, the term itemset is equivalent to the term feature-set, which is a set of features. Let D    r 1  r 2  000  r n   be the database and I   x 1  x 2  000  x m represent all features appearing in D The record r i  represents the i th m tuple in D  Each quantitative feature x k 1 000d  k  000d  m is associated with some fuzzy variables, say v 1  v 2  000  v t Every fuzzy variable is represented by a membership function. For easy representation in the following MFx i  v j 1 000d  i  000d  m and 1 000d  j  000d  t is used to uniquely denote the j th membership function of feature x i In the mining of fuzzy association  ite mset consists of two parts: items and fuzzy variables, say X  U  where X  x 1  x 2  000  x k  000 I is a collection of items \(or features and U  v 1  v 2  000  v k collection of corresponding fuzzy variables to X in order. Suppose there are totally n records in the database. Then the support of X  U is computed as Sup X  U       1 1 n x r MF n i k j j i v x j j 000 000 000 000 000  where r i  x j  de not es t h e val u e of feat u r e x j of the i th record. For example, suppose four features packet  SYN  ACK and  connection are of concern in a NIDS, and each feature has three fuzzy variables, say low  medium and high then 4 000u 3 12 membership functions are involved, i.e MF  packet  low denotes the low function of feature packet  MF  ACK  high denotes the high function of feature ACK etc. Suppose there are three records in the database, as show n in Table 1. Then the support of the fuzzy itemset packet  SYN  connection  low  medium  low puted as MF  packet  low 3260 000u  MF  SYN  medium 135 000u MF  connection  low 27 MF  packet  low 2170 000u  MF  SYN  medium 75 000u MF  connection  low 65 MF  packet  low 6123 000u  MF  SYN  medium 213 000u MF  connection  low 89   TABLE 1 Records in Database, for an Example  packet  SYN  ACK  connection 3260 135 75 27 2170 75 43 65 6123 213 27 89  A fuzzy association rule has the form of 000s  X  U  000  Y  V  000s  where X  U and Y  V are two fuzzy itemsets and X 000  Y  000 Let Z  X  000  Y and W  U  000  V where 000 is the concatenation operation. The support of the fuzzy association rule X  U  000  Y  V is computed as Sup Z  W  confidence of the rule is computed as Sup Z  W  X  U For example, let us c onsider the following fuzzy association rule   SYN  ACK  high  low  000  connection  medium  if SYN is high and ACK is low, then connection is medium  Its support is computed as Sup SYN  ACK   connection  high  low  medium nfidence is computed as Sup SYN  ACK  connection  high  low  medium up SYN  ACK  high  low  According to the proposed algorithm [1 pac k et  information was collected to form one record ev ery short time unit, and to mine out the newest rule set as the latest record was being gathered. Each current support value of a fuzzy itemset was kept in the memory for a time unit. As the next record was being gathered, the algorithm used the current support value to compute the next one, and then replaced it with the new one, as shown in the example below. Suppose the quantitative values of the four features packet  SYN  ACK and connection are measured for each time unit and in sequence they are t 1 97 310, 66, 311 t 2 215, 208, 75, 210 t 3 62, 710, 41, 88 000  t i 230, 86, 31, 720 000 For the fuzzy itemset X  U   packet  SYN  connection  low  medium  low  support value s at t 1  t 2  t 3  t i is computed individually as s t 1  MF  packet  low 97 000u  MF  SYN  medium 310 000u  MF  connection  low 311\1 000o  tmp  s t 2  tmp  000u 1 MF  packet  low 215 000u  MF  SYN  medium 208 000u  MF  connection  low 210\\ / 2 000o  tmp  s t 3  tmp  000u 2 MF  packet  low 62 000u  MF  SYN  medium 710 000u  MF  connection  low 88\\\ / 3 000o  tmp  000  s t i  tmp  000u  i 1 MF  packet  low 230 000u  MF  SYN  medium 86 000u  MF  connection  low 720 i  000o  tmp  000    III  G ENETIC O PTIMIZATION OF M EMBERSHIP F UNCTIONS  As discussed in Section 2, two important keys need to be addressed for a successful NIDS which are based on fuzzy association rules. One is appl ying incremental mining, instead of static mining, to meet real-time demands. The other is a deliberate design for membership functions. Based on the incremental mining algorithm [1 t h e pap e r fu rt her ext e nds the algorithm to design an online response system with genetic optimization in membership functions Membership functions design is important, and they usually have profound affects on the mined rules. This research adopts

a genetic algorithm to select the best membership functions for the features applied in the proposed NIDS system. The membership functions applied in this paper are listed below, in which abs\( \e absolute function, ^ is the power operation and a  b  c  d  e  f  g and h are the constants. The output value of a membership function falls in the interval of [0, 1 Each feature has its own membership functions, i.e., with different constants from feature to feature. The goal of a genetic algorithm is to derive the most appropriate membership functions for every feature. As shown in Figure 1, for a feature its membership functions before and after genetic evolution are depicted by solid lines an d dashed lines, respectively  Membership functions Low f  x 1 / \( 1 + abs x  a  b  c  Medium f  x 1 + abs x  d  e  f  High f x \ 1 / \( 1 + exp\( g  x  h    Figure 1 Membership functions before and after genetic optimization    Figure 2 Gene and chromosome structures of evolution  Suppose n features are considered in the NIDS design, then one chromosome in the genetic algorithm contains the n  featuresí membership functions, as defined in Figure 2. The first chromosome in the experiment was constructed heuristically. An initial popul ation, containing 30 chromosomes, was derived from the first chromosome by repeated application of th e mutation process. In each generation, the fitness of each new chromosome was evaluated according to the performance of the proposed NIDS, using the fuzzy membership functions re presented by the chromosome i.e., the fitness function of the genetic algorithm was to maximize the overall accuracy in a given labeled dataset. A specified percentage of the chromosomes with high fitness were retained for the next generation. Then, parent chromosomes were repeatedly selected from the current generation, and new chromosome s were generated from these parents by crossover and mutation. One generation ended when the number of chromosomes for the next generation had reached the original population i.e., 30 chromosomes. The evolution process was repeated for 250 generations  IV  T HE P ROPOSED S YSTE M In the training stage, attack-fr ee network traffic information was collected at the rate of one record every two seconds, and the genetic optimized membership functions were derived in advance from a labeled dataset. The online response system consists of four modules. Module_A collected run-time network traffic information online, at the rate of one record every two seconds, and consistently sent the records to module_B. Module_B applied the genetically optimized incremental mining algorithm to generate the newest fuzzy rule set every two seconds. At the same time, module_C also performed the algorithm every 2 seconds on the attack-free data records, i.e., adding on e new attack-free record every 2 seconds to the set of mined data records. The two newest rule sets from module_C and module_B were then sent to module_D for comparison, again, once every two seconds. If their similarity was below the threshold, an anomaly of network traffic could be found. Once an attack had been detected, three actions resulted an alarm was inserted into the database, module_A was required to gather more detailed information about the attack and, finally, the filtering rule in the firewall could be chan ged dynamically. In the implementation, a round-robin strategy was applied on the attack-free records in module_C In this paper, the similarity between the two rule sets was defined as follows. Let S 1 and S 2 be two rule sets. The similarity between them was computed as  sim  S 1  S 2  2 1 2 1 S SCORE S SCORE 000u  1 where 000_ S 1 000_  000_ S 2 000_ represent the number of rules in the sets 000 000 000\005 000 1    1 2 S r S r score SCORE and 000 000 000\005 000 2    2 1 S r S r score SCORE  For a single rule r with support s and confidence c and a rule set S  score  r  S was defined as 
584 


If there is a rule r  r in S with support s and confidence c then score  r, S     max    max max 1 s s s s c c c c 000c 000c 000\020 000c 000c 000\020 000\020  else  score  r, S    max c  s     2  Two rules r and r are regarded as r  r if they have the same antecedents and conseque nts. Finally, let SCORE1 or SCORE2 be 0 if it was a negative value. In our system, for any fuzzy itemset, its support was computed by Current support  support due to the latest record k  support due to all historical records  1 k  k is a constant between 0 and 1.                                                        \(3 For a NIDS design, the importance of the latest data record should be greater than that of any single historical data record  Three cases of k  k 0.2 k 0.5, and k 0.8, were studied in the experiments  V  S IMULATION R ESULTS AND A NALYSE S Although four attack categories, i.e., DoS, Probe, U2R, and R2L, have been identified in KDD CUP99 datasets [7 f  the related works in the literature based on fuzzy association rules 11, 2, 3, 4, 5 have a ppl i e d o n l y on e or t w o fl oo d i ng attacks for evaluation: ElñSemary et al   named ipsweep to evaluate their system; Bridges and Vaughn  ap pl i e d an ot her at t ack na m e d mscan to demonstrate their methodís effectiveness; Florez et al 3 lied  mailbomb to show their performance; Dickerson et al 4 appl i e d t w o ki nds of attacks, TCP port scans and ICMP \(ping\ns in their experiments; Hossain et al 5 s ed portscan to show their effectiveness; while Shanmugam a nd Idris  as 2   ap p lied  mscan  The reason for applying only one or two flooding attacks to the evaluations in [1, 2, 3, 4 m a y have been d u e t o  t h e following two considerations. First, in order to detect the other two kinds of attacks, U2R and R2L, in KDD CUP99 datasets, a NIDS has to check the packet payload because the malicious actions are due to content-base d features, suggested by domain knowledge, in the data portion of a connection. As mentioned in the Introduction, the 41 features presented in KDD CUP99 are complicated and diverse. The above anomaly NIDSs [1, 2 3, 4 t h at were based o n fuzzy association rules checked only headers without packet payloads. However, U2R and R2L do not cause any malformation of packets or packet violation to network protocols. Secondly, the amount of packets generated by U2R and R2L in KDD CUP99 may be negligible in huge background traffic. Thus, there may have been no significant difference between rules mined from attacked online network traffic and rules mined from attack-free network traffic Attacking tools were downlo aded from the VX Heavens website \(http://vx.netlux.org/\ich is maintained by the wellknown Antivirus Lab, Kaspersky. A total of 47 attacking tools of flooding were studied for this research. In the experiments of this section, a commercial application named IP Traffic  was applied to produce background traffic which can generate any amount of TCP/UDP/ICMP packets by hardware limit Two hosts running IP Traffic played sender and receiver respectively, and the receiver in the LAN and the sender transmitting packets was deployed through the Internet. During the experiments of this study, the amount of network traffic remained from 0 to 80 Mbps through random connection and random flow size. One laptop launched flooding attacks against the victim located in the LAN through the Internet. Our system deployed in the LAN, was coded by Microsoft Visual C MFC and run on a laptop with Windows XP. A total of 1000 attack-free traffic records were derived from IP Traffic in advance and stored in the databa se, one at a time for every two seconds  As these records in the database were exhausted, they were cyclically reused All of the 20 features applied in this research are listed in Table 2, which were all derived from IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP ARP, and IGMP headers. They we re adopted to collect packet information and generate one record every two seconds. Every feature in Table 2 had three degrees: low, medium, and high  TABLE 2 Feature List TCP: S.IP+SYN count TCP: S IP+URG_Flag+URG_data count TCP: S.IP+ACK_Flag+ACK count ARP: S.IP+ARP count IP: D.IP slots hit IP: Header length!=20 count IP: MF_Flag count IP: \(Total length>1400 || <40\ &&TTL 64 count IP: checksum_error count TCP: ACK_Flag+ACK count TCP: checksum_error count TCP: SYN count UDP: Same_length_interval count UDP: length distribution count ICMP: Type error count ICMP: checksum_error count ICMP: S.IP+ICMP packets count ICMP: ICMP packets count IGMP: checksum_error count IGMP: Length>1000 count   Three cases of k in Eq. \(3 k 0.2 k 0.5, and k 0.8 were considered separately in the experiments. Detail of the similarity in degradation from the win32.fakeping attack is illustrated in Figure 3. A win32.fakeping attack was remotely launched at the fifth time unit lasting for 10 time units of flooding; the attack was stopped at the fifteenth time unit. This system deployed in the LAN showed that the similarity began to degrade at the sixth time unit even more so during the next ten units, and then started to upgrade at the sixteenth time unit If the threshold of similarity is set to 0.5, the system, for the case of k 0.2, would generate the first alarm at the seventh time unit \(similarity value = 0.483554\ and the last alarm at the twentieth time unit \(similarity value = 0.478354\. Ideally, the NIDS system in the LAN should show an alarm at the sixth time unit because an attack ha s occurred and to end the alarm at the sixteenth time unit becau se the attack has disappeared Since historical data records are taken into consideration in the incremental design, it may be difficult for the similarity to

immediately go down below the th reshold as an attack occurs and immediately go up above the threshold as the attack disappears. The smallest similarity value was 0.124654 for the case of k 0.2 in Figure 3, occurred at the fifteenth time unit. It also can be concluded from Figure 3 that during the incremental mining the larger ratio of the latest record, i.e k  value, causes the system to become more susceptible Win32.fakeping ceaselessly pings the victim machine with an abnormal size of payload   Figure 3 Similarity degradations while being Win32.Fakeping attacked    Figure 4 Smallest similarity values for different flooding attacks  All 47 flooding attacks were tested and their smallest similarity values, as shown in Figure 4, were all below 0.5 except for Win32.winskiller. If the threshold was set to 0.5 only Win32.winskiller caused a false negative Win32.winskiller attacked the NetBIOS name service protocol located in the upper UDP The IP and UDP headers of Win32.winskiller packets were normal. In our system, all malformatted NetBIOS headers belonged to the data payload of UDP and, thus, could be ignored, which was why the smallest similarity could go no further down  VI  C ONCLUSION  This study focuses on online real-time response to anomaly traffic caused by DoS or Worm flooding attacks. In the design this proposed system has adopted incremental mining of fuzzy association rules, with genetic optimization on the membership functions. Experiments were conducted which demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of this intrusion response system in preventing flooding attacks  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported in part by the National Science Council, project no.: NSC 96-2221-E-130-009 and 97-2221-E130-014  R EFERENCES    Aly E l Se m ary  Janica E d m ond s Jes 000c us Gonz 000c alez-Pino and Mauricio Papa, ìApplying Data Mining of Fuzzy Association Rules to Network Intrusion Detection,î in Proc. of the IEEE Workshop on Information Assurance United States Military Academy, 2006  Susan M  Br idges Ray f or d B  Va ughn, ìIntrusion Detection via Fuzzy Data Mining,î in Proc. of the Canadian Information Technology Security Symposium, 2000  Germ an Flor ez Susan M  Br idges  and Rayford B.

158 


 WRAcc  now also perform signiìcantly better than Conìdence and Speciìcity is now additionally outperformed by the F-measure and WRAcc while it no longer performs signiìcantly better than Purity Finally Correlation signiìcantly outperforms Conìdence Obviously some measures might be better than others in distinguishing the top k subgroups from false discoveries when k 1  while others might be better when k  100  The observed changes are not very dramatic and we consider the selection of k a user-derived parameter in the method One of the signiìcant relations that seems somewhat peculiar is the result that for both k 1 and k  100  Conìdence performs signiìcantly better than Purity while the latter is deìned to be max  Conìdence  1  Conìdence   While there is a good theoretical reason to consider the Purity of a subgroup we can see from the deìnition that Purity has a lower bound of 0  5  hence the random baseline will generate higher values with Purity than with Conìdence Apparently the quality of the subgroups found with Purity does not increase enough compared to those found with Conìdence to compensate for this effect By comparing the second and third columns of Table III with the last two columns we can see that  WRAcc   WRAcc and particularly Purity perform better when we restrict the tests to datasets with a binary target These measures beneìt from the fact that in these test cases we have a better balance between positive and negative examples in the data compared to test cases on other datasets We can also read from the table that we have fewer measures that are signiìcantly better than others on datasets with a binary target This is mainly because because signiìcance is hard to achieve in an experiment with only 18 test cases as opposed to 85 or 78 on all datasets With 18 test cases the critical difference for the Nemenyi test with signiìcance level 002 1 is CD 4  496  rather than CD 2  069 with 85 test cases Since the average ranks range from 1 to 12  a critical difference of 4  496 is substantial More signiìcant differences between the quality measures can be expected when tested on more datasets with a binary target The results for the EMM variant were generated on a modest number of test cases As a result the critical difference for the Nemenyi test is quite high and one could not expect to nd many signiìcant results Expensive experimentation may give a signiìcant reason to prefer one measure over another in this setting For now what matters is that this illustrates that our method is applicable in more general settings than just traditional subgroup discovery VII C ONCLUSIONS We propose a method that deals with the multiple comparisons problem in subgroup discovery i.e the problem that when exploring a vast search space one basically considers many candidates for a statistical hypothesis hence one will inevitably incorrectly label some candidates as passing the test Our method tackles this problem by building a statistical model for the false discoveries the Distribution of False Discoveries DFD This distribution is generated by given a dataset and quality measure repeatedly running a subgroup discovery algorithm on a swap-randomized version of the data In this swap-randomized version while the distribution of the target variable is maintained its correlation with the attributes is destroyed Hence the best subgroup discovered on this dataset represents a false discovery The DFD is then determined by applying the central limit theorem to the qualities of these false discoveries Having determined the DFD one can solve many practical problems prevalent in subgroup discovery For any given discovered subgroup one can determine a p-value corresponding to the null hypothesis that it is generated by the DFD refuting this null hypothesis implies that the subgroup is not a false discovery Given a set of quality measures one can use the DFD to determine which quality measures are better than others in distinguishing the top k subgroups from false discoveries This gives an objective criterion for selecting a quality measure that is more likely to produce exceptional results Finally given some desired signiìcance level 002  one could extract from the DFD a minimum threshold for the quality measure at hand When validating single subgroups we see that our method removes insigniìcant subgroups found on datasets that have few numeric attributes From metalearning we nd that on large datasets for instance with more than ve numeric attributes the random baseline is more likely to accept many patterns This is reasonable because of the associated larger hypothesis space Table II shows that our method can remove insiginìcant subgroups on some of the datasets with more than ve numeric attributes but not on all of them When we validate quality measures we have outlined that the method we described determines the extent to which a quality measure is also an exceptionality measure We have seen that of the twelve measures for subgroup discovery we tested 006 2 is the best exceptionality measure and Purity and Sensitivity are by far the worst For the EMM correlation model variant no signiìcant conclusions can be drawn from the modest experiments In this paper we have presented a technique making extensive use of swap randomization Notice that we do not by any means claim to have invented this particular randomization method Also its use in step I of the method we introduced in this paper is not the only option available We have extensively explained why using swap randomized data leads to a good model for false discoveries but it comes at a price for every result of a subgroup discovery run one wishes to validate one has to run the same subgroup discovery algorithm an additional m times where m needs to be large enough to satisfy the constraints of the Central Limit Theorem In the more traditional subgroup discovery setting one can usually afford this extra computation time 
159 


For more complex settings for instance the EMM variant using Bayesian networks introduced in this becomes problematic When computation time becomes an issue one might consider different randomization techniques to generate R 1 R m  for instance by simply drawing a random sample from 002 of a certain size for each R i  Before such a technique can be employed its theoretical ramiìcations need to be explored In future work we also plan to empirically investigate the effect of certain parameters on the outcome of the method A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is nancially supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientiìc Research NWO under project number 612  065  822 Exceptional Model Mining R EFERENCES  J Friedman N Fisher  Bump-Hunting in High-Dimensional Data Statistics and Computing 9\(2 pp 123Ö143 1999  W  Kl  osgen Subgroup Discovery Handbook of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery ch 16.3 Oxford University Press New York 2002  S D Bay  M J P azzani Detecting group dif ferences Mining contrast sets Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 5\(2 pp 213Ö246 2001  G Dong J Li Ef cient mining of emer ging patterns Discovering trends and differences Proc KDD pp 43Ö52 1999  P  Kralj No v a k N La vra 031 c G I Webb Supervised Descriptive Rule Discovery A Unifying Survey of Contrast Set Emerging Pattern and Subgroup Mining Journal of Machine Learning Research 10 pp 377Ö403 2009  Y  Hochber g A T amhane Multiple Comparison Procedures Wiley New York 1987  J F  urnkranz P A Flach ROC n Rule Learning  Towards a Better Understanding of Covering Algorithms Machine Learning 58 1 pp 39-77 2005  N La vra 031 c P Flach B Kav 031 sek and L Todorovski Rule induction for subgroup discovery with CN2-SD Proc ECML/PKDD 2002  H Grosskreutz Cascaded subgroups disco v ery with an application to regression Proc ECML/PKDD 2008  B F  I Pieters A Knobbe S D 031 zeroski Subgroup Discovery in Ranked Data with an Application to Gene Set Enrichment Proc Preference Learning workshop PL2010 at ECML PKDD 2010  W  Dui v esteijn A Knobbe A Feelders M v an Leeuwen Subgroup Discovery meets Bayesian networks an Exceptional Model Mining approach Proc ICDM pp 158Ö167 2010  D Leman A Feelders A Knobbe Exceptional Model Mining Proc ECML/PKDD Part II pp 1Ö16 2008  Y  H Xu A Fern On Learning Linear Ranking Functions for Beam Search Proc ICML 2007 ACM International Conference Proceeding Series vol 227 pp 1047Ö1054 ACM New York  H Grosskreutz S R  uping On Subgroup Discovery in Numerical Domains Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 19\(2 pp 210Ö226 2009  A Gionis H Mannila T  Mielik  ainen P Tsarapas Assessing data mining results via swap randomization Proc KDD pp 167Ö176  2006  A M L yapuno v  Nouv elle forme du th  eor  eme sur la limite de probabilit  e St Petersburg 1901  K Pearson L Filon Mathematical contrib utions to the theory of evolution iv on the probable errors of frequency constants and on the inîuence of random selection on variation and correlation Phil Trans A 191 pp 229Ö311 1898  J Dem 031 sar Statistical Comparisons of Classiìers over Multiple Data Sets Journal of Machine Learning Research 7 pp 1Ö30 2006  M Friedman The use of ranks to a v oid the assumption of normality implicit in the analysis of variance Journal of the American Statistical Association 32 pp 675Ö701 1937  M Friedman A comparison of alternati v e tests of signiìcance for the problem of m rankings Annals of Mathematical Statistics 11 pp 86Ö92 1940  P  B Nemen yi Distrib ution-free multiple comparisons PhD thesis Princeton University 1963  M Ojala G C Garriga A Gionis H Mannila Ev aluating Query Result Signiìcance in Databases via Randomizations Proc SDM pp 906Ö917 2010  N Me giddo R Srikant Disco v ering Predicti v e Association Rules Proc KDD pp 274Ö278 1998  W  Kl  osgen Explora A multipattern and multistrategy discovery assistent Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining pp 249-271 1996  C Silv erstein S Brin R Motw ani Be yond Mark et Bask ets Generalizing Association Rules to Dependence Rules Data Min Knowl Discov 2 1 pp 39Ö68 1998  P N T an V  K umar  J Sri v asta v a Selecting the right inter estingness measure for association patterns Proc KDD pp 32Ö41 2002  G I W ebb Disco v ering Signiìcant P atterns Machine Learning 68 1 pp 1Ö33 2007  M Meeng A J Knobbe Fle xible Enrichment with Cortana  Software Demo Proc Benelearn pp 117Ö119 2011  D Ne wman S Hettich C Blak e C Merz UCI repository of machine learning databases 1998

cc ur ac y   Fig. 4. Accuracy for Model-based clustering and rule-based classification Fig. 5. Distribution of flow attributes in scatter plot matrix In Fig.5, the distribution of IP and ports for source and destination is depicted for Model-based clustering method. For HTTP \(blue traffic to few destination IPs. HTTP behavior is prominent because a number of source hosts are communicating with small number of destination hosts, i.e., HTTP servers. In DNS application, source hosts communicate with a set of DNS servers. Each host interacts with different domains such as www, .org and .net for resolving IP addresses. The DNS behavior is prominent because large group of source hosts communicate with small repeated set of destination IPs. In the IRC application, a group of hosts communicates with other group of hosts. There is roughly one-to-one correspondence between source and destination IP. This behavior is prominent because IRC \(cross with approximately equal number of destination IPs. Moreover, source IP and destination port distribution show that destination port numbers are in the range of 30000 for SMTP green where as HTTP and MAIL have destination ports number in lower range of 1000. Model-based clustering with the Apriori algorithm provides reliable and accurate classification model as compared to K-mean method. The association rules helps us predict flows for particular application with high confidence and lift values IV. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have presented a classification model that achieves high flow classification accuracy with application behavior profiling. The use of the K-mean algorithm for Netflow classification was shown to be inefficient. On the other hand, Model based clustering with association rule mining techniques provided a much better accuracy. Moreover the rule heuristics are produced automatically, making the algorithm modular and independent of the dataset. In addition

denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
