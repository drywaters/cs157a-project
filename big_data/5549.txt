A Proposal to Enhance  Cross marketing via Social Networks by Modelling and Analyzing Market Basket like Patterns across Social Network Groups          Abstract The ability to create groups has for long been one of the features of interest for the users across the social networks Groups allow users  account holders to join them  be a fan follower of them, etc. In addition   there have been provisions for the account holder to also be a part of multiple groups as a member. The primary goal of our research is to analyze patterns within group membership Essentially   we will be proposing a model based on m arket basket analysis over  a subset of the social network  groups  and then derive a set of associative mining rules  amongst these networks The information mined may 
 provide interesting insights  for cross marketing purposes For instance  using this technique  an organization O x  could fi nd that the buyers  of their product x  tend to be socially fans or members of groups with the subtype Y  or even   perhaps   more specifically with another organization O y  that sell a product y  Using such data   the organizations may then try to levera ge these findings to build a co opetative Co operation  Comp etition   profitable synergy and might also give them insights to determine which products of O y  may be impacted if the store discontinues selling the product x 
or vice versa   The aim of this pa per is to bring in a new high level dimension to the social network analysis area by imbibing the concepts of Market Basket and then try to provide a basic feasibility criterion for the entire approach by simple simulations  Index Terms   Social Network Analysis, Data Mining, Market Basket Analysis Association  Mining, Social Network Intelligence   I  I NTRODUCTION  AND R ELATED W ORK  I n the recent past social networks and Social Network Analysis \(SNA\have been deemed as some of the most critica l components of computer supported social interactions, serving the business analysts and strategist with a whole new method of capturing customer mindset market trends etc Content generated in social networking environments would include 
discussion thr eads across social network groups micro blog  sharing  social status messages and any other content posted by users This  accumulated content  can be considered as an asset that has value which can be tapped through the right types of analyses. This asset  has potential value to both owners of the sites as well as the organizations whose products and services are being discussed It presents significant implications for enterprises wanting to leverage social networks to draw insights and inferences on user participation and pre ferences expressed in networks  While the SNA trends are creating ripples in the technological front and Web 2.0 arena, there has been quite a wide spread interest in it from the management  front as well It shows considerable promise for helping analysts to handle  a number of classic situations  
like  understand ing  the myriad relationships that  can either facilitate or impede information transmission diffusion and  propagation  as explained by Blondel et al in  3   through the analysis of a social network diagram  a map of individuals and the social ties that link them together Apart from this it would also help them to come up with answers to some strategic questions like  How is the information  about a particu lar product/gadget, etc that was developed or manufactured by the organization flow ing and propagating  outside of the organization  What are the kinds of sentiments that are being showered upon this product   5   Is there an individual within this social graph who could help the 
organization in propagating the news about this product   5   Are  there some subgroups t hat are not sharing what they know  as effectively as they should  In this paper, our key research  hovers over  modeling the use of aspect s  like Market Basket Analysis   2   by clubbing it  with Social Network Grou ps to build association rules  and rule metrics to extract a tripartite relationship between products  organizations and individuals and  in parallel   extract a set of associative mining rules  from them  II  P ROPOSED M ODEL  The primary objective of the proposed model is to analyze patterns within group membership. Essentially  
 we propose to perform  a market basket analysi s on a subset of social network s   g roups. For the purpose of  analysis       With this in mind let us now define some basic definitions and notations involved in the model  A  Formal Model  Definition  1 A Social Network Group  is  a database  of pages connected by elementary links that provide a  single non decomposable content of a group  in the form of group pages  These group pages 
  have a user status   other  Instead they import streams of related public content from user status messages  We now revamp this entire notion of group pages  groups and links  into a graph based model  as follows   Bharath C  International Institute of Information Technology  Bangalore, India  bharath.c@iiitb.net    Jai Ganesh  SETLabs, Infosys Technologies  Bangalore, India  jai_ganesh01@infosys.com  


 Definition 2  We have a directed graph G     N E   that consists  of a set of node s   N  which can be of two types    either a group  or  a user  and E is the  set of edges or arcs  A node K u    N  is an entity that corresponds to a group page  K of the user u   u  could also be interchangeably addressed as a user page    An arc is a n ordered pair  u    v    E  and it     refers to a group page  and u  v  refers to user pages  In this case u  and v  can be identical or can be different   In addition the graph is weighted and the weight of an edge expresses the number of users that have established a link including the one under consideration   that are associated with a given group and moreover, t he graph G  need not necessarily be connected  N ow to capture the user  preference among the groups  we introduce the concept of an association rule   which could be of the form X x    Y x  with a certain probability   x    This probability is called as the confidence  of the association rule  and is read as the probability of a user x  who is associated with a group X  to also be associated with a group Y   Definition 3  A Market Basket association rule  between a user  and a group  is an expression of the form X x    Y x  where X   Y   N which form an  ordered pair X u  Y u    E    u  v  with a confidence  This confidence represents the probability that a user  would be a part of a group  Y  given that he or she is already a member of group  X    i.e with X as the source and Y  as the destination. It would be good to note that        Mathematically if        denotes the number of user s  who are a member of group  X  and Y with X  as the source  and               represents the number of users who are a member of group X  and  any other group other than group Y   Then the confidence C XY  between X  and  Y  is given by the equation    X  Y                   Definition 4   Now  that we have defined the notion and concept of confidence  betw een the groups   w e introduce the concept of the releva nce  of these confidences   Basically the motivation behind introducing this is to validate the level of confidence  and  because of the fact that a rule that holds a respectable degree of interest   if and only if   the corresponding link is traversed a significant number of times  relative to the average  This is called the support of the association rule    Now we define that a support  of the an association rule      is if and only if  is the number of times the groups X  and Y  were associated   directly through a link   over the average of times all the links  in the graph were traversed  Thus      X  Y            1           where  E  is the number of arcs  in E   The value  of  usually ranges around 1 and i f the value of    1  it implies that the support for the association rule  is greater than the average and vice versa   B  Methods for Mining Association Rules  While the previous sections described the motivati on behind using the Market Basket Analysis kind of a concept over the social network groups this section concentrates on the different types of methods that are available to apply association analysis to data  i  Algorithms for Social Network Market Basket A nalysis  In the recent past powerful search engines  have been developed to aid in locating unfamiliar documents b y category, contents or subject  It is still not  feasible to extract in full  the  meaning of an HTML document   However more recently   intellig ent software agents have been developed which extract semantic features  from the w ords or structure of an HTML do cument   These extracted features are then employed to  classify and categorize the do cuments      On the other hand   we are not concentrating in obtaining the entire semantics of  the HTML data but concentrating more o n mere classification and categorization of the documents    There a re a  number of methods and techniques that are proposed in this space of social netw ork cl assification like the ones in 7   8    T h e  ge n e ra l  t e nde n c y  a n d r e s e a r c h  p a t t e rn amongst them has been that the technique of clustering  has been provably the simpler  and more intuitive  method  especially for grouping over social network s     The  res u lts of  such a  clustering mechanism could then b e used to automatically formulate queries and search for other similar  profiles  that imitate a particular class  of profiles   w hich is exactly what is required for execution of a Market Basket  A nalysis  kind of a scenario  More intuitively we could see that for an analysis like Market Baske t o ur key areas of concentration are on grouping based on a binary matrix  as explained earlier  Thus, the key parameters for clustering would be more towards using  the notion of  Y es Yes     Yes No    and     kind of value groupings to form the clusters  So essentially, from a high level  perspective   to perform a Market Basket Analysis   we must satisfy the following requirements  We also explain how we plan to satisfy this requirement in our paper   a  First requirement is a n approach for analyzing market bask et data  the discovery and in terpretation of association rules   2    In this paper we perform the association mining and build the association rules using the a priori  algorithm  that is  described in detail by Agarwal et al  in 1   b  The  second requirement is to combat the explosion of uninteresting rules  That  means we need to calculate interestingness measures  9   on the rules These measures can then be used to either rank the rules by importance \(or  present a sorted list to the user\ or as an additional pruning criterion. How exactly interestingness is deter mined varies by measure but many existing measures take the approach that interestingness is    For this we use the existing and provably good methods involving the calculation of measures like confidence  support and interestingness  as explained in the earlier sections   c  Thirdly we need to devise a mechanism to  organize observed data into meaningful structures that is to develop taxonomies  In other words  we need to conduct  cluster analysis to sort objects into  groups in a way that 


 the degree of association between two objects is maximal if they belong to the same group and minimal otherwise   For this we use the density based clustering mechanisms commonly known as DBSCAN that has been explained in detail by S ander  et al  in 10    d  Finally, we need to analyze  the different patterns within the clusters from a macro scale  and build inferences from them   The patterns might include analyses like identifying the most influential  nodes of a category type X  which are a part of a cluster K  which could play a crucial role in maximizing the information diffusion  and spread  across the cluster elements which would be typically a user profile   We use tools like Weka    www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml weka    and  Rapid  Miner  rapid i.com   f o r  t hi s  t a s k   III  S IMULATIONS  AND E XPERIMENTS  A  Test bed and Data set Information   The test bed for the simulations and experiments  consisted of a  large data set of 19,359  transactions  or users  bearing UserIDs  and each userID in turn ha ve a number of itemsets  13 to be precise  In this  study we used data from F acebook   www.facebook.com  The data was collected from a  sample representative of the user  population slightly over sampling younger age groups to reflect the active audience   The structure of the  dataset  was scraped from F acebook using the facebook java api  and comprises a set of users their social graph information in terms of their unique ID   as well as information about the group that they belong to   spanning over a set of  major  group types  like  B usiness  E ntertainment  Internet  Technology Music Organizations Sports  and Student    We then adopt an alternative e mpirical approach to determine  the inter relationships between the   social pursuits and employ  Market Ba sket Analysis  over this data  This allows us to identify the inter relationships between the peop le who are interested in Business, E ntertainment I nternet   T echnology, Music, Organizations, Sports and Student fr om the F acebook social network  To ease i nterpretation we decided to model the results based on a kind of conditional independence graphs   A conditional independence graph is one in which we have four  possible clusters each representing the Yes Yes Yes No No Yes and  No No  clusters as shown in the  Figure 1   The figure shows the clusters for a few  key associations  in a two dimensional format between Business  and Internet  Technologies   The Yes Yes  clus ter indicates the cluster of  users  whose interest lies in Business  and Internet Technologies t he cluster Yes No  indicates the cluster of users  who are interested in Business  but not in Internet Technologies   similarly  No Yes and  No No  clusters  also indicate the respective user  preferences   B  Experi ments and Data Analytics  The experiments and d ata analytics were conducted on the data sets that were  mentioned above  The entire analysis was conducted to verify the proposed model and lay down a good platform for future research  As a simple proof of concept we  have proposed a simple simulation that  was conducted using  Weka  data mining tool  using th e DBSCAN cluster algorithm and the a priori  associative mining algorithm  which were  pre built in W eka   The results of the clusters are as show n i n the graphs below  Figures 1 and  2 depict a two  dimens ion al analysis where as Figure  3 depict s a three  dimensional analysis of data  The explanations of the figures  and the derived inferences  are  provided below  the respective figures   Fig  1  shows a 2 dimensional correlation across a Yes Yes Yes No No Yes and  No No  clusters The annotations in the figure depict the state each cluster denotes It was observed that the Yes Yes  cluster had the smallest support  and the No No  had the largest support     Fig 1   A 2D Cluster Analysis of Internet v/s Business   From th is we could infer that if an individual is concentrating in leveraging his/her business  that is internet  viral based, then probably the number of potential influencers or information propagators   Yes Yes  cluster  is extremely less when compared to information receivers  The ones in the Yes No No Yes and  No No  clusters  or if we are looking at figure 2 which deals with the Organization  versus Business  clustering we could see that the support  and confidence  of the  Yes Y es  association is moderate and greater than the support and confidence of Yes No  and No No  clusters    From this we could infer that if an individual is concentrating in leveraging his/her Organizational  Business  then probably the number of potential  influencers or  Yes Yes  cluster is not very less when compared to information receivers The ones in the Yes No, No Yes and  No No  clusters   Fig 2 A 2D Cluster Analysis of Organization v/s Business   Till now we have been observing and analyzing the clusters 


 in a purely 2 dimensional perspective viz  in a 2 parameter world of Market Basket Analysis   However, people like Tang et al in  11  ha v e  s h o w n  t h a t  w e  t e n d t o  ge t  a  b e t t e r  perspective when the soc ial world is viewed as a triadic  component than just a bi partite  component  So the next model of analysis shows us the possibility of deal ing  and deriving inferences from a 3 dimensional clusters  In the 3 dimensional  clusters  in addition to the existin g parameters of 2 dimensional clusters there  will also be another parameter  that would be included  This would enable  the support  and confidence  of finding a potential positive influence r  of type X  inside a Market Basket Cluster between two other types  of itemset  in a  social media transaction   i.e. a transaction that is build for Market Basket Analysis over social media     The figure  3  depict s  this kind of analysi s that was  made on the dataset     Fig  3 A 3 D Cluster Analysis of Internet v/s Business  and Entertainment  It shows a  3 dimensional correlation across a Yes Yes, Yes No, No Yes and  No No  clusters between Internet and Business  Groups with Entertainment  Group as the third dimension. The clusters are depicted in such a way that the clusters are a part of the Market Basket of Internet  versus Business  analysis and the colored elements in the cluster depict the presence or absence of the third parameter  or itemset   the red  colored items indicate that they are a part of the Entertainment  group and blue   Entertainment  group  Through the cluster analysis it was seen that the No Yes  No No and the Yes Yes  cluster had a high support  for Entertainment  and the Yes No  cluster had a low support  for Entertainment   One possible inference that we could derive from such an analysis is that we could exploit the possibility of using the users  as  potential influen cers  in places of good or high internet and business  interest groups  w hich actually seem s very much intuitive   the very essence of this study was to bring out more and more inferences that usually seem  non intuitive  and non obvious   IV  C ONCLUSION  In this paper  we have addressed a practical application of Market Basket Analysis over Social Network Groups by formally introducing  a new and efficient  paradigm for cross marketing in Social Networks  This problem is of practical interest and has  been extensively res earched by the data mining community in the last six years Many researchers have devoted much time and energy to discover clever and fast algorithms But most common application of Market Basket Analysis has been deeply concentrated in retail business ch ain  and  there has been no work at all in using this over the Social Media   more so   with the social network groups   Our proposal  of this sort of modeling did not depend on new tricks Instead it is carried out using a sequence of standard calculation techniques such as frequent  pattern mining  clustering and  support, confidence and interestingness filters  But we believe that this way of modeling Market B a skets across social groups could be e ffi ciently  and effectively used to  implement and increase cross selling and cross marketing across social media   This research conducted by us is very significant in this way that not only was it for verifying the fe asibility of the approach on practical platform but also for building a much needed paradigm that is necessary to bridge the gap between transactional real world and social media markets  On the other hand this is a lso a  kind of an introductory proof of  concept seminal work that was conducted to help inculcate a new paradigm  of thoughts into the SNA arena we  are currently working across multiple social networks and larger datasets to try and bring out better analysis and associations between the user gr oup  pairs across the social networks  R EFERENCES  1  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases   International Conference on Manag   207  216, May 1993  2  Han J, Kamber M  Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques   2nd edition San Francisco: The Morgan 2006   3  V D Blondel J L Guillaume R Lambiotte and E Lefebvre Fast unfolding of communities in large networks 2008  4  Liben Nowell D Kleinberg J The Link prediction problem for social networks  Proceeding International conference on information and knowledge management, New Orleans, LA  2003  5  Michelle de Haaff  Sentiment Analysis Hard But Worth It  CustomerThink   accessed  on  2010 08 12  6  José Borges and   Mark Levenev  Mining Association Rules in Hypertext Databases  In Proc of the fourth Int Conf on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1999  7  B.

TABLE IV P ARAMETERS OF 3D-TDAR-M INE  Parameter Range Minimum Support Threshold 0~1 Coherence Threshold 0~1 Pattern Minimum Length Threshold 2 Total time point numbers Minimum Confidence Threshold 0~1 Time-delay Threshold 0 Total time point numbers C Coherence Threshold Analysis In this section, we discuss the PCC and proposed TS 3 influence of pattern and rule numbers satisfied different Coherence Threshold. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the result that Minimum Support Threshold defines as 0.7 and 0.8 respectively. Pattern Minimum Length Threshold defines as 5. Minimum Confidence Threshold defines as 0.9. Timedelay Threshold defines as 3 Figure 7 Pattern number under different Coherence Threshold Figure 8 Rule number under different Coherence Threshold Figure 9 MF Semantic Similarity under different Coherence Threshold Figure 10 BP Semantic Similarity under different Coherence Threshold Figure 11 CC Semantic Similarity under different Coherence Threshold It was observed that PCC produced more patterns and rules than TS 3 in the same parameters. Further, when Minimum Support Threshold raises, satisfied pattern and rule numbers sink Furthermore, Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the result that we verify the rule with GO Semantic Similarity under MF, BP and CC of GO respectively It was observed that when define Coherence Threshold strictly, the gene expression are more coherently. Therefore the GO Semantic Similarity rises. But, due to satisfied pattern and rule numbers sink. It will be more easily to be influence of meaningless rules. Therefore, we recommend the Coherence Threshold should be defined between 0.88 and 0.8 in this datasets D Rule Analysis In this section, we verify the rules that discovering depend on proposed TS 3 similarity measurement. First, we used the parameters on Table 5 to discover rules. After that we observe these rules mapping to this Pathway. The Overlapping type rule “Fus3;0;4 Far1;3;7” can mapping to the Cell Cycle Pathway. Gene Fus3 \(YBL016W\ill regulate gene Far1 \(YJL157C\ to active a Phosphorylation 8  M o re o v e r  th e Ov er la p p in g ty p e  ru le  S w i 5  0  4 Sic1;1;5” also can mapping to this Pathway. Gene Swi5 YDR146C\ will regulate gene Sic1 \(YLR079W\ in the cell division stage [7  T h is is an i m p o r tan t  reg u l at io n t o  th e n e x t  Cell Cycle Secondly, we used the parameters on Table 5 to discover rules. After that, we observe these rules mapping to the Glycolysis Pathway. The rule “PGI1;0;4 PFK2;0;4 PFK1;3;7” can mapping to this Pathway. Gene PGI1 will regulate gene PFK2 and gene PFK2 will regulate gene PFK1 2  TABLE V P ARAMETERS FOR RULE DISCOVERING ON DIFFERENT PATHWAY VERIFY  Parameter Cell Cycle Glycolysis Minimum Support Threshold 0.6 0.6 Coherence Threshold 0.8 0.8 Pattern Minimum Length Threshold 5 5 Minimum Confidence Threshold 0.9 0.9 Time-delay Threshold 3 3 E Similarity Factors Analysis In this section, we will discuss the similarity factors in the rules that we discovered. Figure 12 show the Coherent Patterns in the rule “Fus3;0;4 Far1;3;7” that measure with 


TS 3 when the Coherence Threshold define as 0.9. We observed that it has Scale relations between the samples in this Coherent Patterns for gene Fus3. And in the Coherent Patterns for gene Far1, it has Shift relation between samples However, if we want to discover this rule that measure the Coherent Patterns with PCC. The Coherence Threshold must define less than 0.75. It will discover a lot of rules that maybe without biological meaning Figure 12 Similarity factors in the Coherent Patterns that TS 3 discovered F Rule Redundant Rate Analysis One gene maybe can discover different Coherent Patterns with different sample set, in the same times points. But, these Coherent Patterns maybe have the same biological meaning In this section, we will discuss the Rule Redundant Rate between PCC and TS 3 And observe the efficiency of rule discovery. We define the Rule Redundant Rate as follow function 2  Number Total Rule r Rule Numbe Redundant dant Rate Rule Redun 2 Figure 13 shows the result with different Minimum Support Threshold defines as 0.9 and 0.8 respectively. In any parameters, TS 3 is more efficiency then PCC manifestly Figure 13 Redundant Rate of different similarity measurement method V C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK This research proposed the 3D-TDAR-Mine algorithm to discover the Temporal Dependency Association Rules in 3D microarray datasets. The rules discovered by 3D-TDARMine can reveal gene expressions reactions and the regulation mechanism between reactions. Meanwhile we proposed the TS 3 similarity measurement to estimate the Coherent Pattern that considers the Shifting, Scale and Trend factors in the real life. After rule discovering, we verify the Temporal Dependency Association Rules with KEGG Pathway and GO Semantic Similarity. It’s also confirmed that the discovered rules are really with Shifting, Scale Trend relation and biological meaning In the future, we will enhance the algorithm to discover the rules more efficiently in terms of time and memory cost Furthermore, we will also try to use other data mining methods and biological information to filter out the rules without biologic meaning so that we may help biologists use the rules more easily and efficiently R EFERENCES 1 M A s hb ur ne r  C  A  Bal l  J  A  Bl ak e e t al  G e n e o n to l o gy  to ol fo r the unification of biology,” The Gene Ontology Consortium.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
