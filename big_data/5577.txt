Each tier is able to collect progressively greater levels of information.  Generally, craft from lower-level tiers are deployed to a target of interest based on its identification by a higher-level craft.  While the architecture promotes significant 
amounts of science being performed in parallel, this may overwhelm the computational and transmission capabilities of higher-tier craft and links \(particularly the deep space link back to Earth\.  Because of this, a new paradigm in in-situ data processing is required Model-based transmission reduction \(MBTR\ is such a paradigm.  Under MBTR, each node \(whether a single spacecraft in orbit of the Earth or another planet or a member of a multi-tier network\ is given an a priori model of the phenomenon that it is assigned to study.  It performs activities to validate this model.  If the model is found to be erroneous corrective changes are identified, assessed to ensure their 
significance for being passed on, and prioritized for transmission.  A limited amount of verification data is sent with each MBTR assertion message to allow those that might rely on the data to validate the correct operation of the spacecraft and MBTR engine onboard Integrating MBTR with a multi-tier framework creates an MBTR hierarchy.  Higher levels of the MBTR hierarchy task lower levels with data collection and assessment tasks that are required to validate or correct elements of its model.  A model of the expected conditions is sent to the lower level craft; which then engages its own MBTR engine to validate or correct the model.  This may include tasking a yet lower level of craft to perform activities.  When the MBTR engine at a given level 
receives all of its component data \(whether directly collected or from delegation\, it randomly chooses some to validate \(by reprocessing the validation data\, performs analysis and sends its own results \(validation and/or changes of model elements and supporting validation data\ to its upstream node.  This constrains data transmission to only significant \(either because it includes a change or is validation data critical for assessing overall performance\nformation and reduces the processing requirements \(by not having to process insignificant data\ at higher-level nodes This paper presents a framework for multi-tier MBTR and two demonstration mission concepts: an Earth sensornet and a 
mission to Mars.  These multi-tier MBTR concepts are compared to a traditional mission approach T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  B ACKGROUND 2  3  I NTEGRATING THE M ULTI T IER A PPROACH AND M ODEL B ASED T RANSMISSION R EDUCTION 3  4  C OMMUNICATIONS P ARADIGM FOR A MBTR  H IERARCHY

Some of 
these applications require that the robots collect data across a wide area of unknown status.  While craft with a single movement-approach \(e.g., ground-based craft conceivably collect the requisite data, their performance would be less than satisfactory when compared with an approach that integrated multiple craft with alternate movement characteristics.  The Multi-Tier Autonomous Mission Architecture \(MAMA on e appr oach th at can facilitate this collaboration.  MAMA coordinates the efforts of multiple craft across orbital, aerial, surface and other tiers.  These craft exchange data and collaborate to achieve mission goals Craft coordination and collaboration can be task-based or goal-based.  Under a task-b ased approach, a controller defines a desired objective \(e.g., imaging a desired area\d the MAMA-member craft autonomously determine the most 
effective way to achieve this goal.  However, in many cases while the desired outcome is known, the exact tasks that are required to perform the outcome are not.  In this case, goalbased control is implemented.  With goal based control, a well-defined \(generally broad\oal is provided to the collaborating craft which then take actions to assess the requirements of goal attainment and perform those actions For example, it may be desirable to find locations containing a particular resource \(either on Earth or another body\sure that an area that troops will be traversing is free of landmines and other threats or determine the validity of a scientific principle.  In these cases, significant data will be collected; however, most of it is not relevant to 


978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 \2512013 IEEE  2 controllers.  In these cases, cont rollers are interested in an assertion \226 and the data to back it up Model-Based Transmission Reduction \(MBTR i s a n  effective way of managing inter-craft and craft-controller communications in cases where investigations or assignments are goal-driven.  Under MBTR, a result and supporting data are conveyed to controllers.  When MBTR is combined with a MAMA, this can be performed hierarchically: several lower-level assertions may be combined to prove or refute a higher \(composite\sertion 2  B ACKGROUND  Pristine-Class Missions Most planetary science missions have consisted of a single large spacecraf In s o m e ca s e s a s u bcra f t h a s  been deployed \(e.g., a lander\wo craft have worked together to achieve a goal \(e.g., the GRAIL mission However, no mission to-date has utilized a large collection of heterogeneous craft, despite the advantages that this approach may provide in certain circumstances.  The trend on Mars has been towards progressively larger lander craft e.g., the current Mars Science Laboratory is car-sized  However, the growing size of these craft is pushing the boundaries of what can be easily and safely landed on the planet\222s surface \(given its atmospheric conditions\e Mars Science Laboratory \(MSL\required an intricate set of maneuvers for this safe landing, which \(while ultimately successful\increased mission risk Earth-orbiting missions are also comparatively large.

Acknowledging this capability shortfall, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency \(DARPA\ has undertaken to provide a quick-response capability, SeeMe, which aims to provide a short duration between capability request and delivery. [9 Multi-Tier Approach Fink d ot h e rs 12, 13] s u g g e s t a n approach t h at  combines the efforts of multiple, comparatively smaller craft with different breadth and depth of coverage capabilities.  Fink\222s \223tier-scalable\224 approach implements top-down control of multiple craft, utilizing the significant computing resources located on the orbital craft, in particular, to coordinate the efforts of the lower-level craft 1, 10, 11, 14  A multi-tier approach, proposed in d ex pan d ed u pon in prov ides g o alb as e d tas k i n g  f r o m t h e h i gh ert ie r  craft; however, the lower-level craft are left to determine the appropriate method for achieving the tasked goals.  A computing task hand-off method allows analysis tasks that exceed the computational resources of a lower-level craft to be performed by a higher-level craft; the results of the analysis are then returned to the lower-level craft for incorporation in decision-making The multi-tier approach also incorporates effective ways of dealing with several specialized circumstances that require greater coordination.  The first is a collaborative task \(e.g., a task that requires coordinated movement in order to be successful\.  For example, if two robots were erecting a structure, movement-level coordination would be required to place a beam successfully into location.  In this case, a script, which includes checkpoints \(where the craft wait until all others required to pro ceed are done\ created by a group or task controller and disseminated to all participating craft MAMA also contemplates cases when it may be desirable to share resources between different groups within the same mission or even across missions.  A craft hand-off and tasking mechanism exists for this Model-Based Transmission Reduction MBTR is a multi-faceted approach to reducing the amount of data that is required via increasing the value of each byte of data o u r l e v e l s of MBT R are pres en t e d  m odel based data transmission, model-based data analysis, modelbased result transmission and model-based findings transmission.  Each subsequent level builds on the value of the lower levels to create a more value-rich data product that is transmitted Model-based data transmission \(MBDT\onstrated with image data in p ares collected ra w data to a model of what is expected.  Discrepancies, above a threshold minimum difference value \(if specified transmitted to Earth-based controllers to refine the original model.  Discrepant data can also be priority-ordered for transmission Model-based data analysis \(MBDA\ uses context-aware assessment to prioritize data for transmission.  While MBDT would choose data based on the largest discrepancy from the model \(e.g., the largest color/shade different for image data\DA utilizes its contextual understanding of the data to determine the importance of model updates.  For example, MBDA could be instru cted to prioritize data that crosses a threshold \(e.g., well-performing versus underperforming crops\ver data that indicates a quantitatively larger discrepancy from the model 


978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 \2512013 IEEE  3 Model-based result transmission \(MBRT\hances MBDA by formulating a prospective conclusion based on the data under assessment.  Data is then prioritized based on its level of support or refutation of the conclusion under consideration \(with data that provides either strong support or refutation prioritized over data that is of lesser value Model-based findings transmission \(MBFT\ is the highestvalue level of MBTR.  Under MBFT, the spacecraft\222s onboard computing software autonomously evaluates a model of a phenomenon of interest and evaluates the observed data in light of this model.  The software updates the model, based on the observed data.  It the selects sample data elements to send back in conjunction with the updated model for verification purposes 3  I NTEGRATING THE M ULTI T IER A PPROACH AND M ODEL B ASED T RANSMISSION R EDUCTION  The integration of the MBTR and MAMA architectures necessitates several changes to the basic forms of both architectures to ensure interoperability.  While the architectures are comparatively synergistic, some of the control logic of the multi-tier architecture must be replaced with an MBTR-compatible approach.  Similarly, the MBTR approach \(based on MBFT\ must be revised to trigger additional lower-tier data collection Changes Required to the Multi-Tier Architecture A typical MAMA mission begins with the tasking of the orbital or system-level craft \(the system-level craft is utilized to coordinate the efforts of multiple mission-specific orbital craft\with a high level objective.  The orbital \(or system\t sub-divides this task into sub-tasks for one or more subordinate craft.  These tasks are assigned to the subcraft, which review the assigned tasks, possibly further subdividing the tasks into tasks for their subordinate craft.  At each level, the craft may opt to collect data itself \(for verification, etc.\efore tasking its subordinates.  This is where the prototypical mission concept comes from: an orbital craft takes imagery, which is used to assign targets to a UAV, which is used to deploy and task ground rovers The incorporation of MBTR requires that the MBTR analysis engine be running on each involved craft.  Instead of just sub-dividing tasks to effect their completion, the MBTR engine sub-divides research goals into component goals.  For example, the assertion that a route is safe might be subdivided into several assertions covering areas of the route \226 or assertions covering safety from various types of dangers.  The former would be based on craft movement capabilities; the latter on craft sensing capabilities.  Each craft must perform \(or have performed for it, using the processing job off-tasking functionality\ data analysis to determine whether it possesses sufficient data to respond to the research goal that it is pursuing.  If not, it must collect or arrange for the collection of this data.  If sufficient data is not obtainable, it must assert and defend this assertion Changes required to Model-Based Transmission Reduction The MBTR approach will need to be modified to work in collaboration with the multi-tier architecture.  MBTR, at present, presumes that it is operating on a single craft as a single process.  Further, it is not resource-consumption Figure 1\226Typical Multi-Tier Mission Hierarchy 


978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 \2512013 IEEE  4 aware.  A typical MAMA/Multi-Tier hierarchy is shown in Figure 1.  However, when operating in the resource-limited space \(or remote planetary\ environment, resource usage is a key consideration.  This is further intensified by the fact that the MBTR process, under the multi-tier MBTR approach may be commanding vehicular movement.  Given the limited amount of fuel and risk associated with this activity the MBTR process must make resource-conscious decisions.  Specifically, it must project the possible value of the data that could be collected by a requested action and compare that to a projected co st.  A heuristic is used to determine whether to command the action immediately or to store it as a candidate task to be compared with other possible data gathering activities An MBTR Hierarchy Figure 2 shows the data collection process of a MBTR hierarchy.  The process begins with a task assignment.  The MBTR software determines the appropriate collection of craft to assign the task to.  This may include the current craft e.g., the orbital craft which may need to take a high-areaof-coverage image to begin with\ter this initial data collection is conducted, one or more craft may be tasked to make \(or refute\e assertions required to confirm \(or refute\he high-level objective.  As Figure 2 shows, a craft may task its subordinate \(e.g., craft 4, in the example collect additional data that is required to confirm or refute the assertion Once the data is returned to the orbital craft, it attempts to confirm or refute the assertion.  In many cases \(presuming correct projection of the data required\is may be immediately possible.  However, in others \(as shown in the figure\ditional data collection may be required.  In the specific example depicted in Figure 2, craft 2 is tasked to collect additional data that is deemed necessary.  The data sufficiency analysis is conducted again and, presuming sufficient data is available, the controller is notified of the identified result 4  C OMMUNICATIONS P ARADIGM FOR A MBTR  H IERARCHY   M ULTI T IER M ISSION  Previous wo en t e d a bas i c i n t e rrobot con t rol  methodology for sending tasks between robots.  This approach, however, is not suitable in its current form for a combined MAMA/MBTR mission.  The message format however, was designed to be extensible.  This basic four message format is expanded to provide the foundation for the MAMA/MBTR inter-craft communications Existing Message Format The basic approach from s is t s of  f o u r  m e s s a g e s   a command message, query message, data transmittal message and an exception message.  The command message is utilized to convey a tasking assignment.  The query message is utilized to obtain status / health information performance data, task progress data or stored data.  The data transmittal message is used to transmit raw data between the various system nodes \(craft\.  Finally, the exception message is used by a subordinate craft to advise its superior that an error condition has occurred or that it will \(or that it appears plausible that it will\ail to meet a performance milestone Extended Message Format The extension of each basic message type will now be presented.  These messages are still compatible with the messaging framework discussed in   Figure 2 \226 Process Flow for MAMA/MBTR Mission 


978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 \2512013 IEEE  5 Command Message 226The command message, in the base format, is designed to assign an object of interest for assessment.  This message contains an object identifier approximate coordinates, a prioritization and a type descriptor.  This message is extended via adding additional type identifiers.  Instead of referring to a single object, a command message can now refer to a phenomenon.  If the phenomenon is of global interest, the coordinate fields are left blank.  For localized phenomenon, coordinates can be supplied.  Message body space is used to describe, in a machine-readable format, the assertion that the command message confirmation or refutation of Query Message 226The base query message contains a globally unique query identifier and either a task identifier or an action type identifier.  The task identifier would correspond to the command\222s identifier for task assignment.  This message is not changed; however, additional space in the message body is used to send back the current belief values for the assertion that the robot is trying to confirm or refute Data Transmittal Message\226The data transmittal message was designed to be a free-form message to accommodate numerous data types that a robot might need to send \(e.g graphics, binary sensor data, etc.\.  It begins with a query or task ID, corresponding to the query or task that the data relates to.  For the MAMA/MBTR approach, the body of this message utilizes the MBTR model description language to describe the proposed changes to the model that the robot is proposing.  Further, it forwards \(in a second message\he data that is required for the superior robot to confirm or refute the assertion that it is making Exception Message\226The base exception message is used to convey robotic failures and mission-performance-related exceptions.  This message is used as-is, with the addition of the additional type descriptors discussed, previously, in the context of the command messages 5  E VALUATION OF THE MBTR  H IERARCHY C ONCEPT  A qualitative evaluation of the MAMA/MBTR approach has been performed.  The key consideration was how the combined framework performed relative to a normal MAMA mission or single-craft MBTR implementation Several considerations were identified; however, these could not be quantified, as they are heavily reliant on implementation-specific details.  First, it is unclear as to the effect that the incorporation of the MBTR software onboard the lower-level craft would have on the performance of their onboard control software.  In the worst case, the processing requirements might completely overwhelm the capabilities making the combined mission unfeasible \(or requiring additional investment in hardware to make the mission possible\Also problematic is the fact that the combined approach may operate, but in an inefficient way.  The realtime control needs of the robot and the long-duration processing needs of the MBTR evaluation process may be in constant conflict for the limited processing capabilities onboard the spacecraft.  These scenarios will need to be tested for during the mission implementation process Second, it is clear that the MAMA/MBTR combined framework is not an optimal solution for all mission types Missions that are not data-collection and processing driven would not be candidates for the combined approach.  This raises an obvious question: what is the optimal approach for a mission with multiple objectives.  A Mars mission, for example, might have significant data-driven aspects however, there may be construction and other requirements Further testing is required to see if the MBTR aspects of the combined framework can be successfully made dormant to allow performance during non-data-collection-driven mission aspects to perform at the level of the base MAMA approach 6  D EMONSTRATION M ISSION C ONCEPTS  Two demonstration mission concepts are presented to aid in the understanding of the implementation of the MAMA/MBTR architecture.  The first of these missions, an Earth sensornet application, would be an excellent test case for the second, a Mars survey mission.  The use of MAMA for a Mars mission has been discussed previously in  this is extended, herein, to incorporate the MBTR technology, making the mission more versatile, reducing mission communications requirements and increasing mission autonomy and utility An Earth SensorNet An Earth sensornet application would be an excellent test case for the MAMA/MBTR architecture.  The Earth sensornet \(depicted in Figure 3\ consists of a lead \(pristineclass\rbital tier member, four smaller orbital craft \(in this case 3-U CubeSats are presumed\ree aerial craft \(UAVs are presumed\d six ground craft.  It is presumed that the ground craft start the mission in a proximal position to their corresponding aerial craft The CubeSat-class spacecraft, while orbital-tier members  Figure 3\226Earth SensorNet Application 


978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 \2512013 IEEE  6 are not hierarchal superiors to the aerial craft.  They can be used, however, to relay messages from the orbital lead satellite to the aerial and \(if necessary\ground craft A weather phenomenon is an excellent test case for this application.  In the case that a severe weather instance was detected, orbital imaging could be utilized to obtain a highfield-of-view imagery to localize the scale and location of the phenomenon.  The UAVs could \(presuming that their safe operation could be assured, depending on the type of the weather phenomenon\hen be deployed to the region to collect additional visual sensing data.  Moreover in applications where wind speed was a significant interest e.g., a tornado or hurricane\e difference between the craft\222s believed flight speed and GPS-derived movement could be utilized to characterize the winds aloft at each altitude level that the UAV could fly at for this purpose In the case where the UAVs could not be safely deployed or conditions where additional on-ground data collection e.g., damage assessment\r higher resolution data was required, the ground-based craft could be deployed to collect additional data A Mars Mission A MAMA/MBTR Mars mission is also considered.  In this application, with a smaller number of craft, two aerial craft are deployed from the orbital lead satellite \(which is also the interplanetary spacecraft that carried the other six craft to Martian orbit\hese aerial craft will deploy the ground rovers to the surface in the instance of their first use This mission contemplates two sets of complementary objectives.  First, the craft will perform exploratory activities across the Martian surface.  Second, a science station will be erected on the surface.  The ground craft in the left group \(under aerial craft 1\er and have additional manipulation capabilities to effect this goal They must be deployed in close proximity to the drop point of the science station \(which is deployed, similar to the MSL\222s deployment meth y to th e s u rf ace T o  ensure that the craft that will erect the structure are located by its drop location, aerial craft 1 will survey the area and locate the station before deploy ing the craft to the area These craft will participate in construction activities initially when not needed, they will perform local characterization activities\ce construction is complete, they will move progressively further from the science station to investigate phenomenon identified by the or bital lead craft and/or aerial craft 1.  The science station has capabilities that any ground craft can utilize for additional sample processing \(in addition to its ongoing independent activities 8  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  The aforementioned presents a vision for the combination of two previously independent research efforts.  It appears that the two technologies present a significant synergy, when implemented in conjunction.  This initial work has focused on the combination of the two technologies and the resolution of several areas where the two technologies implement aspects of the control and other processes in different ways.  Future work will focus on its implementation in the Earth sensornet application discussed in section 6 as a precursor for the Mars application \(and other possible applications  R EFERENCES   J  Strau b an d R  Fev i g  223M u lti T ier P l an etary  Exploration: A New Autonomous Control Paradigm,\224 Proc.

In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.

Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earth’s orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraft’s orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the mission’s product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earth’s rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
