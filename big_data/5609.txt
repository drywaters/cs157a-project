  978-1-4799-1622-1/14/$31.00 \2512014 IEEE  2  Figure 1 - GPS Signal Propagation and Scattering The direct GPS signal provides a coherent reference for the coded GPS transmit signal and is used to pinpoint the location of the \265Sat. The scattered signal contains detailed information about the ocean roughness, from which local wind speed can be derived. The location on the ocean\222s surface where the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection of the transmitted GPS signal is referred to as the specular point and will correspond to a sample of highest power recorded by the DDMI. The annulus region surrounding the specular point that produces the majority of the reflected GPS signal received at the \265Sat antennae is referred to as the glistening zone  Onboard the \265Sat, the DDMI takes the received reflected GPS signal and generates a type of scattering image referred to as a Delay Doppler Map \(DDM\hown in Figure 2. The DDM is the primary science data output of the DDMI  Figure 2 - Delay Doppler Map The coordinates of a DDM are Doppler shift and time delay offset. Each pixel of the DDM is obtained by crosscorrelation of the received signal with a locally generated replica time delay and Doppler shift. An open-loop tracking algorithm allows each DDM to be processed by predicting the position of the specular reflection point from the known positions of the receiver and GPS transmitter. Available hardware resources allow generation of four simultaneous DDMs per second  3  C ONSTRAINTS  Required global coverage for the CYGNSS mission is provided by eight \265Sats dispersed in a 500 km, 35\260 circular orbit. In this LEO, each \265Sat in the CYGNSS constellation will only make ground contact with a Universal Space Network \(USN\station for an average of 420 seconds \(7 minutes\very two days. See Figure 3 for an illustration of the CYGNSS ground coverage  Figure 3 - Ground Coverage of CYGNSS Constellation over 90 min \(one orbit Because each observatory in the CYGNSS constellation is a 265Sat, limited space is available for solar array placement Figure 4\The limited space available for solar arrays equates to a limited amount of power for the avionics  Figure 4 - CYGNSS \265Sat Dimensions A limited amount of power for the avionics equates to a limited amount of Radio Frequency \(RF\ energy able to be produced by the transceiver for data transmission. It is currently anticipated that the transceiver for the CYGNSS mission will be capable of downlinking data at a maximum rate of 3.5 Mbps. Total downlink throughput of the CYGNSS constellation is also driven by the LEO of the constellation, meaning short ground contact times In addition to a limited amount of power available for transmitting data via RF, a limited amount is available for 


  978-1-4799-1622-1/14/$31.00 \2512014 IEEE  3 the CPU running the Flight Software \(FSW\rrently anticipated the CPU will be clocked at 12.5 MHz of the available 100 MHz the processor is capable of running  4  A DDRESSING B ANDWIDTH C ONSTRAINTS  As with any mission, one goal of the avionics system is to downlink the maximum number of bits to the ground in the least amount of time possible. This goal is especially  important on CYGNSS, with the limited downlink rate of 3.5 Mbps and the ground contact time of 420 seconds per pass Given the ground contact time and downlink rate calculations show a maximum of 184 megabytes of data can be downlinked during one ground pass. This 184 megabyte set must include the Spacecraft Housekeeping \(H/K telemetry and all science data collected and stored since the last ground contact  To address the constraint of the limited ground contact time and downlink rate, several design concepts are being incorporated into the FSW of the \265Sat 1  Data Reduction and Compression of the Science Data 2  Compression of the H/K and Engineering Data 3  Minimizing the H/K and Engineering Data Each of these solutions for addressing downlink constraints are discussed in the following paragraphs Data Reduction and Compression of the Science Data As discussed earlier, the DDMI primarily produces one type of Science Data: DDMs. Each DDM in its raw form consists of 2,560 pixels \(128 delay rows by 20 Doppler columns with 32 bits per pixel. The DDMI will transfer four DDMs per second, which translates to a rate of 0.3125 Mbps. The DDMs will be received by the onboard Spacecraft FSW for further processing and eventual downlink. If DDM production continued at a rate of 0.3125 Mbps for two days 6.592 gigabytes of data would need to be stored and downlinked. This 6.592 gigabytes of data equates to 3668 more than the maximum of 184 megabytes that can be downlinked in one ground pass To reduce the size of the DDM dataset, a data reduction and compression algorithm produced by the CYGNSS science team will be incorporated in to the Spacecraft FSW. For each raw DDM, the algorithm identifies a subset of pixels that contain mostly reflected signal \(i.e. glistening zone\ and identifies pixels that contain mostly noise \(i.e. noise floor From these subsets, the algorithm generates two datasets for eventual downlink that are further compressed by reducing the number of bits represented by each pixel The glistening zone dataset of a DDM contains the pixels that have captured the majority of the reflected GPS signal To identify the glistening zone pixels, the algorithm first creates a low pass filtered DDM from the raw DDM and then finds the maximum valued pixel within the filtered DDM. This maximum valued pixel represents the estimated specular point of the glistening zone. This filtered version of the DDM is used to reduce sensitivity to noise in finding the computed specular point. Once the specular point pixel is found, a predetermined number of pixels around the computed specular point, which represent the glistening zone, are selected, as shown in Figure 5. The glistening zone pixels are further compressed by selecting the nine most significant bits that represent scattered signal for each glistening zone pixel before creating the output glistening zone dataset for downlink  Figure 5 - DDM with Glistening Zone Pixels Identified To estimate the system noise contribution to ocean scattered signal within the glistening zone, the noise floor of each DDM must also be sampled. This is done by selecting a predetermined number of rows \(e.g. four\e the computed specular point pixel as shown in Figure 6 summing the pixel values in each row into one value per row, and for each summed row value selecting the 12 most significant bits that represent noise before creating the output noise floor dataset for downlink. Each individual row is downlinked to verify the absence of ocean scattered signal as the noise rows approach the specular point 


  978-1-4799-1622-1/14/$31.00 \2512014 IEEE  4  Figure 6 - DDM with Noise Floor Rows Identified After the compressed glistening zone pixel dataset and the compressed noise floor dataset are generated from each raw DDM, they are packetized and stored in onboard flash memory for eventual downlink. Since both the glistening zone and noise floor datasets are bit sample decimated, the compression algorithm is considered lossy. It is currently anticipated that the DDM compression and decimation algorithm will reduce the size of the DDM science data by a ratio of 47:1 Although a full DDM is not captured for later downlink when using this algorithm, the compressed dataset produced is more than adequate to meet the spatial resolution and sampling requirements of the mission. A compressed DDM restricts the region of the ocean scattering to the portion within 50 km of the specular point, and four DDMs will be gathered and compressed at a rate of 1 Hz If necessary for diagnostic purposes, the mission software will support a mode that turns off the compression and stores full DDMs for later downlink Compression of the H/K and Engineering Data To reduce the size of the Spacecraft H/K and Science Meta Data packets, a standard software compression library may be used to further reduce the amount of bits to eventually downlink. Given the anticipated stream of data representing nominal H/K and Science Meta Data and the compression library chosen, a compression ratio of 3:1 is expected While from a bandwidth perspective it is advantageous to have the data as compressed as possible, doing so adds complexity to ground processing software and also reduces the onboard Spacecraft CPU utilization margin. Initial experimentation has shown that compression may take up to 0.038 milliseconds of CPU time per byte compressed Minimizing the H/K and Engineering Data Additionally, to make the most of the limited bandwidth efforts are being made in the design phase of CYGNSS to minimize the size and rate of real-time Spacecraft H/K packets produced that will inform the Missions Operations Center of the spacecraft health and status. Less bandwidth used by real-time telemetry allows for the majority of the data downlink bandwidth to be used for science data To accommodate for the reduced amount of H/K that will nominally be recorded to onboard Flash memory, a wraparound First in First out \(FIFO\ffer may be used to record a history of critical spacecraft telemetry. This FIFO buffer may be downlinked in the event of an anomaly  5  A DDRESSING P OWER C ONSTRAINTS  As discussed earlier, the size of the \265Sat and the corresponding space for Solar Arrays equates to less power available for the CPU. Although the CPU can be clocked up to a speed of 100 MH t i s pl ann e d t o be cl oc k e d at  12.5 MHz to conserve power To address the constraint of the processor being clocked at 12.5% of its maximum clock speed, several design concepts will be incorporated into the design of the hardware and software of the \265Sat 1  Multi-processing capabilities of the dual-core processor will be used for concurrently running two sets of CPU instructions 2  Science data collection and downlink operations within the FSW will be mutually exclusive 3  Ability to change the CPU speed will be possible via a Field Programmable Gate Array \(FPGA\ during Integration and Test \(I&T\ operations Each of the above solutions to addressing the power constraint of the CPU is elaborated on in the following paragraphs Multiprocessing and Dual-Core Processor To use the multi-processing capability of the dual-core processor, the FSW will consist of two Operating System OS\ecutables running in an Asymmetric Multiprocessing \(AMP\nfiguration [6 O S  executable running one core of the CPU will be responsible for a different set of tasks. For example, one OS executable may be responsible for spacecraft health monitoring and command/telemetry processing, and the other OS executable may be responsible for running the ADC algorithm and science data processing. Each OS executable will run on one core of the CPU. Due to the CPU cores sharing resources Interrupt Controller and On-Chip Peripheral Interfaces\, it has been found that the amount of power needed to run in a 


  978-1-4799-1622-1/14/$31.00 \2512014 IEEE  5 dual-core configuration is 80% of what it would require to run in a single-core configuration at twice the dual-core clock frequency. See Figure 7  Figure 7 - Dual-Core vs. Single-Core While the use of a dual-core does save power, it comes at the price of complexity. Since the chosen OS does not support Symmetric Multiprocessing \(SMP\multiple copies of the OS must be stored in volatile and non-volatile memories for one version of the FSW. See Figure 8 for the anticipated partitioning of the onboard non-volatile Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory \(MRAM   Figure 8 - Memory Map Mutual Exclusion of Science Collection and Downlink  While most missions would require that science data collection executes while a downlink is taking place, the relatively short time of the downlink \(420 seconds every two days\makes it reasonable to design the system such that science data collection and a downlink operation be mutually exclusive. This will prevent the \265Sat FSW from needing to accommodate downlink operations while simultaneously devoting CPU cycles to processing and storing science data CPU Clock Speed Modification While the current design allows for an appropriate level of margin in the processing capability, additional margin could be attained by changing the clock speed of the processor However, this increase of processor speed comes at a cost to the power margin. Assuming the processor runs both cores each 1 Mhz increase in clock speed will increase the power consumption by 24 mW  The onboard FPGA is designed such that clock dividers and multipliers may be used to change the CPU clock speed This ability will allow the possibility of increasing the speed of the CPU during I&T operations if it is found that the FSW needs to handle more processing than anticipated  6  C ONCLUSIONS  As the miniaturization of electronics continues, more technologies become available making \265Sats and other small-size commercial applications possible. The Size Weight and Power \(SWaP\ savings in a \265Sat or a miniaturized commercial product are large and beneficial but come at a price of increased engineering complexity and constraints On CYGNSS, the smaller size of the \265Sat compared to a conventional science satellite equates to less power than normally available. Less power equates to less margin available for downlink bandwidth and CPU speed, which creates design challenges to be overcome by those responsible for the design and implementation of the hardware and software of the \265Sat. This paper offers solutions to common mission constraints for \265Sat avionics architectures

Figure 8  Monte Carlo simulation results for position updating 10,000 random base angle combinations were calculated and used with each combination sampled 10,000 times with a known error distribution 050which was diagonal but not isotropic\051 The results show that the approximate mean estimate outperformed the analytic solution for almost all angular combinations Left an overhead view showing the pitch angle on the x-axis and the yaw angle on the y-axis Right the same plot viewed with the yaw angle on the x-axis and the rms error difference on the y-axis 050a positive difference corresponds to an improvement by the approximate mean estimation\051 mial estimation can be divided into two categories modeling in the region where the 002nite Taylor series converges and modeling in the region where the Taylor series does not converge In the convergent region the best-\002t polynomial of a given degree should closely match the Taylor series outside of this region the data may be better 002t by a polynomial function that is less accurate than the Taylor series in the convergent region of estimation but more accurate than the Taylor series outside of the convergent region Tests were run at three times with trajectory estimations used to project both forward and backward and the models were compared to the true trajectory and the corresponding-degree Taylor approximation The motions provided here are the motions in the x-direction the corresponding trajectory function is provided Oscillation\227 The periodic function used was x 050 t 051  sin 050  1 t 051  4  Trajectories were calculated at t  5  t  20  and t  50  then extrapolated out to t  100  The results for the linear quadratic and cubic 002ts are provided in Fig 9 Viscous Flow\227 The exponential decay function used was x 050 t 051  e 000  01 t  4  As in the oscillation example trajectories were calculated at the time intervals t  5  t  20  and t  50  The results are summarized in Fig 10 Drag\227 The logarithmic function used was x 050 t 051  log 050  025 t  1\051  4  The trajectories were calculated at the same intervals as in the previous cases The results are provided in Fig 11 In all three special types of motion considered the leastsquares trajectory calculated by the estimation method performs as well as or better than the corresponding-degree Taylor approximation This is especially notable and important in the logarithmic case where the radius of convergence is only up to a value of 1 for the function used this would correspond to convergence up to t  40  as can be seen in the plots In contrast the cubic approximation for the log function demonstrates increasing accuracy at large sample sizes closely approximating the curve up to t  80 in the estimation at t  50  6 C ONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated an effective alternative to current trajectory estimation strategies such as Markov chain models and other forms of trajectory reconstruction The method proposed can be achieved in real-time and can effectively operate with less responsive hardware than other tracking methods because of its predictive capabilities In addition this was accomplished with a minimal amount of a priori information using only a known calibrated camera this is a general prerequisite on most trajectory reconstruction strategies and is generally attainable for a system prior to usage The system has also demonstrated linearity in the number of samples required based on unknown parameters a trajectory of degree n requires 3\050 n  1\051 independent equations and as long as the requirements for independence are met trajectories have successfully been recovered at the point where 3\050 n  1\051 024 2 k  where k is the number of images utilized At a frame rate of 30 frames per second this theoretically allows the construction of a 19 th degree polynomial in the 002rst second of measurements For most applications such a high degree estimation may be both impractical and unnecessary but these higher order terms may be useful in the calculation of types of motion not normally well-described by low-degree polynomials Additionally because non-polynomial motions tend to converge better closer to the initial point and diverge 9 


Figure 9  Estimation of sinusoidal trajectory at three sample times The trajectory was estimated by a linear function a quadratic function and a cubic function with three different maximum times 0505 20 and 50\051 As can be seen in all three cases the accuracy improves with the increased sample size and outperform the Taylor approximation The approximations do not predict future times well all three are primarily accurate in the region of measurement Figure 10  Estimation of exponential trajectory at three sample times The trajectory was estimated by a linear function a quadratic function and a cubic function with three different maximum times 0505 20 and 50\051 as with the sinusoidal trajectory In the region observed here the quadratic and cubic functions both demonstrate high levels of accuracy and improvement over the Taylor approximation ultimately however the predictive ability of the polynomial approximation is limited by the end behavior of an exponential decay function compared to that of a polynomial 10 


Figure 11  Estimation of sinusoidal trajectory at three sample times The trajectory was again estimated by a linear function a quadratic function and a cubic function with three different maximum times 0505 20 and 50\051 Here the polynomial estimation shows a marked improvement over the Taylor approximation The results for the estimated polynomial when compared to the Taylor approximation differ in two important ways 002rst all Taylor polynomials are only able to converge over a 002nite range 050 000 1  x 024 1 for the parent function\051 while no such restriction is observed for the polynomial estimation second higher-order Taylor approximations perform worse than lower-order approximations past a certain point behavior that is also not observed here at larger times more accurate results may be attainable by resampling at a later time rather than simply adding terms to the estimation This is exempli\002ed by the cubic estimation of the sinusoidal trajectory above a cubic trajectory can only change directions two times and goes to positive and negative in\002nity at its endpoints as a result there is an inherent limit on its ability to model an oscillatory function which changes directions an in\002nite number of times and remains within a speci\002ed range If each sample is simply added to a stack eventually the accuracy of the estimation will degrade however if only the most recent n samples are used the trajectory utilized can continuously update to re\003ect the current state of the function If the sample size is suf\002ciently large compared to the rate of oscillation this will yield strong convergence at all times and still maintain predictive value albeit only for a truncated time in the future 050the time of one period\051 Additionally for polynomial 002ts the system correctly discriminates between incorrect lower-degree trajectories and the true trajectory This supports a build up strategy for determining the best 002t for a data set starting with lowerdegree trajectory estimations and increasing the tested degree until a threshold value is attained for the cost function 050that is a point at which the system accepts a trajectory as a good 002t\051 Additionally the trajectory estimation can be combined with more traditional methods to improve robustness and compensate for situations where a polynomial representation of the motion may not be available or useful With a known target position position updating can be achieved in real-time by the gimbal system In low-error environments or in applications where the required precision is suitably low position updating only requires the inversion of the rotation matrix and an analytic solution can be recovered This analytic solution can then be used as the initial point for approximate mean determination to achieve more accurate results in environments with high error or where greater precision is required Because the mean calculation is only based on a small subset of the range of available data one avenue for future research is improving the estimation method used to make the calculated mean more accurate 7 F UTURE W ORK Only a subset of potential error types in geo registration were considered here expanding the range of error parameters for which a solution has been derived as well as improving the robustness of the current error estimation would improve the overall effectiveness of the proposed system Additionally because the ultimate goal is to use the methods described to compute trajectory updates in real-time improving the overall speed of the necessary computations will allow the system to better complete its task One key area where improvement can be made is in the search methods used to identify the critical points in both the trajectory estimation and position updating Because each call of the trajectory estimation or position updating requires multiple calls of the relevant search function in both cases they represent the limiting factor in terms of the processing time of the system as a whole Finally further research should focus on extending the applications of trajectory estimation This can include multiple point tracking for a single object which provides an additional constraint on the system by requiring the distances 11 


between tracked points remain constant as well as multiple object tracking which presents the challenge of developing an ef\002cient strategy for classifying points based on which target they belong to in a moving and rotating frame where setting simple classi\002cation thresholds about the change in pixel location may not effectively apply A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Amy Regan and Tanner Trujillo in the Space Instrument Realization Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory 050LANL\051 for providing guidance and infrastructure support during this project R EFERENCES   J M Fitts Aided Tracking as Applied to High Accuracy Pointing Systems IEEE Transactions On Aerospace And Electronic Systems vol AES-9 no 3 pp 350368 1973   S Smith and J Schwickert High Performance Gimbal Control for Self-Protection Weapon Systems in SPIE Conference on Acquisition Tracking and Pointing XII 1998 vol 3365 no April pp 7786   D Chesser Software architecture for an acquisition tracking and pointing system Defense Sensing and Aerospace vol 3365 no April 1998 p 10 1998   J J Littler and M A Brdys Fuzzy Logic Gain Scheduling For Non-Linear Servo Tracking Int J Appl Math Comput Sci vol 12 no 2 pp 209219 2002   M Locke M Czarnomski A Qadir B Setness N Baer J Meyer and W H Semke High-performance Two-axis Gimbal System for Free Space Laser Communications Onboard Unmanned Aircraft Systems in FreeSpace Laser Communications Technologies XXIII 2011 vol 7923 p 79230M79230M8   B Leibe K Schindler L Van Gool and K U Leuven Coupled Detection and Trajectory Estimation for MultiObject Tracking in IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer Vision 2007 pp 18   S Avidan and a Shashua Trajectory triangulation 3D reconstruction of moving points from a monocular image sequence IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence vol 22 no 4 pp 348357 Apr 2000   M Czarnomski J Blakely Z Wang G Williamson R R Schultz and W H Semke Laser Communications for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Using Differential GPS and IMU Data in Free-Space Laser Communications Technologies XXII 2010 vol 7587 pp 75870975870912   J Y Kaminski and M Teicher General Trajectory Triangulation ECCV 2002 pp 823836 2002   E Ribnick S Atev and N P Papanikolopoulos Estimating 3D positions and velocities of projectiles from monocular views IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence vol 31 no 5 pp 93844 May 2009   R Herrejon S Kagami and K Hashimoto Online 3-D trajectory estimation of a 003ying object from a monocular image sequence 2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems pp 24962501 Oct 2009   R H Mendoza S Kagami and K Hashimoto Online 3-D Trajectory Estimation of a Flying Object from a Monocular Image Sequence for Catching in in Visual Servoing no April R.-F Fung Ed InTech 2010   V Lippiello and F Ruggiero 3D monocular robotic ball catching with an iterative trajectory estimation re\002nement 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation pp 39503955 May 2012   Q.-T Luong R Deriche O Faugeras and T Papadopoulo On Determining the Fundamental Matrix Analysis of Different Methods and Experimental Results Robotique Image et Vision 1993   R S Park and D J Scheeres Nonlinear Semi-Analytic Methods for Trajectory Estimation Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics vol 30 no 6 pp 16681676 Nov 2007   T Kim Y Seo and K Hong Physics-based 3D position analysis of a soccer ball from monocular image sequences in Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision 050IEEE Cat No.98CH36271\051 pp 721726   Y Liu D Liang Q Huang and W Gao Extracting 3D information from broadcast soccer video Image and Vision Computing vol 24 no 10 pp 11461162 Oct 2006   Y Goyat T Chateau and F Bardet Vehicle Trajectory Estimation Using Spatio-Temporal MCMC EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing vol 2010 no 1 p 712854 2010   J Wu Some Properties Of the Gaussian Distribution pp 118 2004 B IOGRAPHY  Timothy Matchen is an undergraduate in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at Princeton University pursuing certi\002cates in robotics and engineering physics His primary research interests are dynamics and control theory These interests led him to an internship at Los Alamos in object tracking Brett Nadler pursued his undergraduate and masters degrees at Cornell University and a doctoral degree from the University of California San Diego He is currently technical staff in the Intelligence and Space Research division of Los Alamos National Laboratory His interests include free-space laser propagation and its associated applications in communication and sensing 12
