Recent advances in data mining and machine learning algorithms have increased the disclosure risks that one may encounter when releasing data to outside parties. Association rule hiding is one of important privacy preserving data mining problems. This paper review current approaches addressing data mining and Security and that reduces 3-SAT problem from optimal sanitization in association rule hiding Keywords-3-SAT, Association Rule, NP-Complete, Data mining, Data Sanitization I  I NTRODUCTION  Data mining is a technique that helps to extract important data from a large database. It is the process of sorting through large amounts of data and picking out relevant information through the use of certain sophisticated algorithms as shown in Figure 1. As more data is gathered, with the amount of data doubling every twenty months, data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool to transform this data into information Data mining can be used to classify data into predefined classes \(classification\, or to partition a set of patterns into disjoint and homogeneous groups \(clustering\tify frequent patterns in the data, in the form of dependencies among concepts-attributes \(associations\ general, data mining promises to discover unknown information. If the data is personal or corporate data, data mining offers the potential to reveal what others regard as private. This is more apparent as Internet technology gives the opportunity for data users to share or obtain data about individuals or corporations. In some cases, it may be of mutual benefit for two corporations usually competitors\hare their data for an analysis task However, they would like to ensure their own data remains private. In other words, there is a need to protect private knowledge during a data mining process. This problem is called Privacy Preserving Data Mining \(PPDM\The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First we review current approaches addressing data mining and security We then present a formulation of our problem and show that the optimal solution to it is NP-Complete   Figure 1.  Data Mining II  L ITERATURE  S URVEY  The problem of association rule hiding was first probed in 1  A f t e r t h a t   m a n y a p p r oa c h e s  w e r e p r o p o s e d  Ro ughl y  they can fall into two groups: data sanitization data modification approaches \(data modification for short\d knowledge sanitization data reconstruction \(data reconstruction\ approaches A  Data Modification Approaches Data modification methods hide sensitive association rules by directly modifying original data. Most of the early methods belong to this track Data sanitization is a process that is used to promote sharing of transactional databases among organizations while alleviating concerns of individual organizations by preserving confidentiality of their sensitive knowledge in the form of sensitive association rules. It hides the frequent item sets corresponding to the sensitive association rules that contain sensitive knowledge by modifying the sensitive transactions that contain those item sets. This process is guided by the need to minimize the impact on the data utility of the sanitized database by allowing mining as much as possible of the nonsensitive knowledge in the form non-sensitive association rules from the sanitized database  The basic idea of data modification approaches is the socalled data sanitization. They hide sensitive association rules by directly modifying, or we say, sanitizing the original data D and get the released database Dí directly from D, Most of the 978-1-4577-0240-2/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 43 


existing methods belong to this data modification prosperous track. According to different modification means, it can be further classified into: Data-Distortion techniques and DataBlocking techniques. However, data modification approaches cannot control the hiding effects intuitively as the sanitization is performed on data level Data-Distortion is based on data perturbation or data transformation, and in particular, the procedure is to change a selected set of 1-values to 0-values \(delete items\alues to 1- values \(add items\we consider the transaction database as a two-dimensional matrix. Its aim is to reduce the support or confidence of the sensitive rules below the user predefined security threshold. Early data distortion techniques adopt simple heuristic-based sanitization strategies like Algo1a/Algo1b/Algo2a, Algo2b/Alg  Naive/MinFIA/MaxFIA/IGA R A  R A a n d S W A 4,5  Different heuristics determine different selection strategies on which transactions are to be sanitized and which items are to be victims, which are two core issues affecting the hiding effects in the algorithms. Subsequent techniques like WSDA/PDA d Bo rderBas e d [7 adv a n ced th e s i m p le heuristics to heuristic greedy \(local optimal\gies trying to greedily select the modifications with minimal side effects on data utility Consider a market database co nsisting of 5 transaction and four items. Here 1 and 0 represents the presence or absence of a item in a particular transaction. Let Minimum support threshold be 60% and Minimum confidence threshold be 75  T ABLE 1 S AMPLE D ATABASE FOR D ATA D ISTORTION T ECHNIQUE    In the above sample database shown in table 1, Rule A C has   Support\(A C\=80% Since A and C both are present in 4 transactions out of 5 transactions   Confidence\(A C\=100% Since C is present in all transactions wherever A is present  As in the above problem, Rule A C has support and confidence more than MST and MCT  Let rule A C be sensitive association rule that needs to be hided before database being released. In data distortion approach, items are inserted or deleted for reducing the support and confidence  After applying the data distortion approach, database will be modified as shown in table 2  T ABLE 2 D ISTORTED D ATABASE   Rule A C has Support\(A C\ and Confidence\(A C\0% which is below the MST and MCT Data-Blocking  8 an oth e r d a ta m odification approach  f o r association rule hiding. Instead of making data distorted \(part of data is altered to false\ocking approach is implemented by replacing certain data items with a question mark ì?î. The introduction of this special unknown value brings uncertainty to the data, making the support and confidence of an association rule become two uncertain intervals respectively At the beginning, the lower bounds of the intervals equal to the upper bounds. As the number of ì?î in the data increases the lower and upper bounds begin to separate gradually and the uncertainty of the rules grows accordingly. When either of the lower bounds of a ruleís support interval and confidence interval gets below the security threshold, the rule is deemed to be concealed Example: Consider a market database consisting of 5 transaction and four items Here 1 and 0 represents the presence or absence of a item in a particular transaction Let Minimum support threshold be 70% and Minimum confidence threshold be 80  T ABLE 3   S AMPLE D ATABASE FOR D ATA B LOCKING T ECHNIQUE    In the above sample database shown in table 3, Rule A C has   Support\(A C\=80% Since A and C both are present in 4 transactions out of 5 transactions   Confidence\(A C\=100% Since C is present in all transactions wherever A is present As in the above problem, Rule A C has support and confidence more than MST and MCT  Let rule A C be sensitive association rule that needs to be hided before database being released. In data blocking approach data items are replaced with a question mark After applying the data blocking approach, database will be modified as shown in table 4. Now  Rule A C has Support\(A C\=60% and Confidence\(A C\=75% which is below the MST and MCT  44 


T ABLE 4 M ODIFIED D ATABASE   III  A SSOCIATION  R ULES A ND  S ANITIZATION  In this section, the notion of association rules is precisely defined and a formulation of the problem is given. It is then proven that the problem of findin g an optimal sanitization of the source database is NP-Complete. This is done for a number of \(progressively more realistic\otions of what it means to ìsanitizeî. The proofs are based on reductions of the problem addressed in this paper to the 3-SAT problem A. The Problem Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items  Let   be a set of transactions called the database  Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I A rule is defined as an implication of the form   where  and  The sets of items \(for short itemsets  X and Y are called antecedent left-hand-side or LHS\d consequent righthand-side or RHS\ of the rule The support supp X of an itemset X is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset  Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability P  Y  X e probability of finding the RHS of the rule in transactions under the condition that these transactions also contain the LHS  The lift of a rule is defined as    or the ratio of the observed confidence to that expected by chance An association rule is an implication of the form X  Y  where X  I  Y  I and X  Y   We say the rule X  Y holds in the database D with confidence c if X Y  X  c. It can also be said that the rule X  Y has support s if X Y  D  s. Note while the support is a measure of the frequency of a rule, the confidence is a measure of the strength of the relation between sets of items The well-known association rule mining problem aims to find all significant association rules. A rule is significant if its support and confidence is no less than the user specified minimum support threshold MST d minimum confidence threshold MCT  To find the significant rules, an association rule mining algorithm first finds all the frequent itemsets and then derives the association rules from them. On the contrary, the association rule hiding problem aims to prevent some of these rules, which is referred as ìsensitive rulesî, from being mined  Given a database D to be released with minimum threshold  MST Minimum Support Threshold MCT Minimum Confidence Threshold\d a set of association rules R mined from D a set of sensitive rules Rh subset of R to be hidden, a new database D has to be found such that the rules in Rh can  still be mined from D however with predefined modification and the rules in R-Rh can  be mined as earlier A  3-SAT Satisfiability is the problem of determining if the variables of a given Boolean formula can be assigned in such a way as to make the formula evaluate to TRUE. Equally important is to determine whether no such assignments exist, which would imply that the function expressed by the formula is identically FALSE for all possible variable assignments. In this latter case we would say that the function is unsatisfiable; otherwise it is satisfiable. To emphasize the binary nature of this problem, it is frequently referred to as Boolean or propositional satisfiability. The shorthand "SAT" is also commonly used to denote it, with the implicit understanding that the function and its variables are all binary-valued. n complexity theory, the satisfiability problem \(SAT\n problem, whose instance is a Boolean expression written using only AND, OR NOT, variables, and parentheses. The question is: given the expression, is there some assignment of TRUE and FALSE  values to the variables that will make the entire expression true? A formula of propositional logic is said to be satisfiable  if logical values can be assigned to its variables in a way that makes the formula true. The Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete. The propositional satisfiability problem \(PSAT which decides whether a given propositional formula is satisfiable, is of central importance in various areas of computer science, including theoretical computer science algorithmics, artificial intelligence, hardware design electronic design automation, and verification A literal is either a variable or the negation of a variable \(the negation of an expression can be reduced to negated variables by De Morgan's laws\ample, x1 is a positive literal and NOT\(x1\egative literal A clause is a disjunction of literals. For example, x1  NOT\(x2\ a clause \(read as "x-sub-one or not x-sub-2"\. 3satisfiability is a special case of k satisfiability k SAT simply satisfiability \(SAT\when each clause contains exactly k 3 literals. It was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems 45 


3-SAT :-Let S be the set of literals for 3-SAT problem. Let C be the subsets of finite set S of size 3 and containing literal of clauses, find a smallest set Sí such that every subset in C contains atleast one element in Sí that has to be setted true to make the expression satisfiable B  Reduction from Optimal Sanitization Let A be the set of large itemsets that are ìgoodî in the sense that we do not wish to make them small. Let B  be the set of large itemsets that are ìbadî, i.e., we want to make them small. These two goals can be incompatible, so the problems we formulate below are based on the notion that we want to make all of Bís itemsets small, while making as few as possible of Aís itemsets small. We prove the NP-hardness of these optimization problem based on this notion So Reduction problem can be formulated as Given two sets A and B of subsets of a finite set J, such that no element of B is a subset of any element of A and no element of A is a subset of any element of B, find a set of elements R in J such that every subset in B contains at least one of those elements while minimizing the number of subsets of A that contain elements from R Let J be the set of all itemsets and A and B be the set of itemsets that are non-sensitive and sensitive respectively. So we need to hide the itemsets belong to set B and minimize it in A Example 1 J = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 A = { {1,2} , {2,5 } , {6,7 B = { {1,9} , {2,8} , {6,8  So, R = { 8,9  Reduction  Given an instance of Optimal Sanitization, here is how to create an instance of 3-SAT problem such that polynomial time solution to latter implies a polynomial time solution to the former Let J = {1,2,3,4,Ö.n A = { {1,n-1,n } , { 2,n-1,n } ÖÖ{n-2,n-1,n B cannot have { n-1 ,n } for Optimal Sanitization problem Then for 3-SAT problem  S = J ñ { n-1,n C = B The Sí that solves the instance of 3-SAT problem is equal to the R that solves the instance of Optimal Sanitization Algorithm 3.1 Algorithm for reducing optimal sanitization to 3-SAT problem Input: - Set  J , A , B Output: Set S  1  Let S be set of 3-SAT problem then S = J elements of S which are subset of all sets of A 2  C = B 3  Take Sí = NULL 4  While\(Every subset of C has atleast one of its element in S 5   6  Pick an element x from S 7  Take Count1  = Count of presence of x in sets of C 8  Take count2 = count of presence of x in set A 9  If count1 > count2 then 10  Sí = Sí union x 11   12  Return S  Proof by example Let J = { 1,2,3, ÖÖ10 A = { {1,9,10} , {2,9,10} , {3,9,10} ÖÖ{8,9,10 B can be { {1,2,5} , {3,6,8} , {4,5,7 S = J ñ {9,10 S = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 Then B = C So, Sí = R = { 5,6 Hence 3-SAT problem can be reduced from optimal sanitization IV  C ONCLUDING  R EMARKS  The work reported in this paper can be extended in several directions and much work remains to be done. We plan to investigate different selection criteria and evaluate their impact on the non-sensitive set of rules, as well as to apply various optimizations with respect to both the time and space complexity R EFERENCES 1  Atallah, M., Bertino, E., Elmagarmid, A., Ibrahim, M., and Verykios V.S.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF IMPROVED ALGORITHM The algorithm introduced in this paper can greatly improve the mining efficiency. Firstly, the improved scan the database only once; secondly, it reduces a lot of unnecessary operations. The Improved mining algorithm has lower time complexity as it has explicit object. We test the traditional algorithm and the improved one based on the same situation that all the data are from Table I, and lead to the results showed on Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 showed that improved algorithm improved a lot on time. When it comes to the case that the transaction database is huge and the bigger interested items, the improved algorithm runs much better.

Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED [10] is based upon the idea of transforming one hierarchy into another via certain local editing operations The distance between two hierarchies is the minimum total number of operations needed for transforming the one into the other. Three modification operations are considered: A node i is deleted by transmitting its children to its parent and removing i from the hierarchy. Inserting is the complement of deleting: Inserting i as a child of j makes i the parent of some subset of the children of j. Changing a node means changing its label. In order to make computation in polynomial time possible, the constraint that disjoint subtrees have to be mapped to disjoint subtrees is included in the definition [10], [16 The original definition does not include any normalization For two hierarchies with q labels each, 2q is the highest possible CTED  corresponding to deleting all labels of the first hierarchy and inserting all labels of the second hierarchy We normalize the CTED by 12q which results in distances in 0, 1 B. Taxonomic Overlap TO [11] compares the nodes of two hierarchies according to how many ancestors and descendants they share. We describe a version adapted to our experiments. Define semantic cotopy as SC\(i,H i j Given two hierarchies H1 and H2, the corresponding overlap for i ? L is defined as O\(i,H1, H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 Note that this is a symmetric expression in H1 and H2 with values in [0, 1]. The TO of H1 and H2 is the average of all overlaps TO\(H1, H2 1 q  i?L O\(i,H1, H2 For two identical hierarchies, TO is 1, while it is 0 if H1 and H2 are totally unrelated. Since the two other hierarchy 


proximity measures used in the experiments are distances with smaller values indicating higher similarity TO? := 1? TO to simplify comparisons C. LCA-Path Tree Distance Since in a hierarchy a parent is a more general concept than any of its children, the locations of the same label i in two hierarchies H1 and H2 can be compared by how far one has to travel up the chain of ancestors in both hierarchies until a common ancestor is found. For a label i ? L the depth dH\(i 0 dH\(i pH\(i a1, . . . , av the ancestors of i in H1, such that a1 = pH1\(i a2 = pH1\(a1 i common ancestor of i in H1 and H2, lca\(i,H1, H2 first ancestor of i in H1 which is also an ancestor of i in H2 j? := min  j | j ? {1, . . . , v} such that aj ? AH2\(i  lca\(i,H1, H2 Since 0 is an ancestor of all labels in all hierarchies, the LCA always exists. Note that usually lca\(i,H1, H2 lca\(i,H2, H1 We use the LCA to measure how far apart the positions of a label in both hierarchies are: If a label i has the same parent in both hierarchies it is regarded as being in the same position, otherwise the distances of i to its LCA in both hierarchies are used to measure how far apart both locations are. The cost for i is defined as d\(i,H1, H2 2 k=1 dHk\(i lca\(i,H1, H2 D\(i,H1, H2  0, if pH1\(i i d\(i,H1, H2 8 This can be seen as the length of the path from i to lca\(i,H1, H2 i,H1, H2 As D is not symmetric, the complete LCA-path distance

Comparison All three hierarchy proximity measures presented above reflect different concepts of tree similarity. It is thus not surprising that CTED and TO*, although they perform well in the domains they were designed for, may produce counterintuitive results when used in the field of HE. This is demonstrated by the hierarchies shown in Figure 3: Despite the fact that the relationships between the nodes in both hierarchies are completely different, their CTED and TO are 0.33 and 0.44, respectively. Their LCAPD, on the other hand, is 1.00. Thus only LCAPD marks both hierarchies with the highest possible distance Some hierarchies used in our experiments contain nodes with exactly one child \(single-child labels that TO* does not distinguish between such labels and their children, in the following sense: Given a hierarchy H and a single-child node i, we denote with H ? the hierarchy 


that is obtained from H by swapping i and its child. Then TO?\(H,H CTED or LCAPD V. EXPERIMENTS We tested the proposed data mining system with four multi-label classifiers: ML-FAM, ML-ARAM, ML-kNN and BoosTexter on three real-world datasets with increasing complexity from the text-mining field. In our experiments we compared extracted hierarchies to the original hierarchy by means of three hierarchy proximity measures: LCAPD CTED, and TO The experimental setup of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM had the following parameter values: choice parameter 0.0001; learning rates ?a,b = 1.0 for fast learning; vigilance parameters ?a = 0.9 and ?b = 1.0. The parameter t was chosen to be 0.05 for the 20 newsgroups dataset and 0.02 for the other datasets. The number of voters V was set to 9 Following [8], we used 10 nearest neighbors \(k = 10 Laplace smoothing \(s = 1 BoosTexter was trained using 500 boosting rounds as in 8] and the threshold for converting rankings into multi-labels was set to 0 [9 A. Multi-label Classification Performance Measures We used a large set of performance measures for evaluation of the MC experiments: First, two example-based measures for multi-label predictions: Accuracy \(A measure \(F  of the predicted labels are actually present while F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall calculated on the per-instance basis. The larger the A and F values, the better the MC performance Then two label-based measures were calculated on the basis of binary counts for each label: the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives We used the micro-averaged version of F1 with the binary measures counted on the whole test set. The perfect performance corresponds to F1 = 1. Additionally, micro-averaged precision and recall were used for computing the Area Under a Precision-Recall Curve \(AUPRC  precision corresponds to the proportion of predicted labels in the test set that are correct and recall to the proportion of labels that are correctly predicted. AUPRC has been claimed 


to be a well-suited performance measure for MC tasks where the number of negative instances significantly exceeds the number of positive instances [6]. Another advantage of AUPRC is its global nature and independence of a certain threshold value. The closer the AUPRC value is to 1, the better the performance Since these measures are based on the comparison of multi-labels, they depend on a transformation from rankings to classes. As a contrast we also used four wellknown ranking-based performance measures: One-Error OE RL C cision \(AP  for all ranking-based performance measures except AP. OneError evaluates how many times the top-ranked label is not in the set of proper labels of the instance. Ranking Loss is defined as the average fraction of pairs of labels that are ordered incorrectly. Coverage evaluates how far we need, on average, to go down the list of labels in order to cover all the proper labels of the instance. Average Precision evaluates the average fraction of labels ranked above a particular label i ? mt which actually are in mt And finally, the special hierarchical loss function H-loss 2] were utilized. Following [3], normalized costs were calculated: ci := 1/|c\(p\(i i ? L i of all direct children of i. Hierarchical loss \(H-loss consider mistakes made in subtrees of incorrectly predicted labels and penalizes only the first mistake along the path from the root to a node. The smaller the H-loss value, the better the performance B. 20 Newsgroups Dataset We modified the popular single-label dataset 20 Newsgroups [18], [19] by considering eight additional labels corresponding to the intermediate levels of the hierarchy faith, recreation, recreation/sport, recreation/vehicles, politics, computer, computer/hardware, science. This dataset is a collection of almost 20,000 postings from 20 newsgroups sorted by date into training \(60 40 data were preprocessed by discarding all words appearing only in the test documents and all words found in the stop word list [20]. Afterwards, all but the 2%-most-frequent words were eliminated to reduce the dimensionality. Documents were represented using the well-known TF-IDF \(Term 


Frequency  Inverse Document Frequency scheme [19]. The TF-IDF weights were then normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Conversion to TF-IDF and normalization were performed separately for training and test data. This resulted in the 1,070-dimensional dataset with 11,256 training instances, 7,493 test ones and 28 labels To test the performance of two HE algorithms, we first extracted hierarchies from the True Test Multi-Labels \(TTML and calculated the corresponding proximity measures. Both algorithms successfully extracted the original hierarchy We studied the performance of the multi-label classifiers and their ability to infer the class hierarchies in the presence of only partly available hierarchical information. We performed a series of HE experiments with multi-labels having a decreasing number of inserted non-leaf labels describing the levels in the hierarchy. We randomly removed such labels from 20%, 30%, and 40% of the training instances leaving them single-labeled. The results for predicted test multilabels are shown in Table I where the bold face marks the best classifier, and the first column \(left result of HE by Voting and the second \(right Thresholding \(referred as GT Comparing classification performance, one can see that the ART-based networks are superior to both the other classifiers in terms of most performance measures and that ML-FAM slightly outperforms ML-ARAM. Taken together they win on at least 6 and at most 8 out of 9 evaluation measures. BoosTexter has the second best performance, but its predictive power degrades more quickly with the increase in the number of single-label instances. The poorest MC results were shown by ML-kNN, its performance decreased very fast with any reduction in the number of multi-labels For example, F1 decreased by 15% while removing 40% of labels instead of 30%. It is also interesting to note that when trained on the dataset with 40% removed labels, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM significantly outperformed ML-kNN trained on the original dataset with all labels The hierarchy proximity measures confirm the good quality of predictions produced by the ART-based networks: The hierarchies were correct extracted by both HE algorithms of Section II-B even with 40% removed labels. The predictions of ML-kNN were the worst: The Voting variant of the HE 


algorithm could not extract the correct hierarchy with 30 assigning five labels incorrectly to the root label. None of the HE algorithms could extract the correct hierarchy in the absence of 40% multi-labels. With 40% and Voting, the number of labels falsely assigned to the root was 13, while with GT it was only three. For BoosTexter, Voting assigned two labels wrongly to the root label in the experiment with TABLE I 20 NEWSGROUPS ALL, -20%, -30% AND -40% RESULTS Measure all 20% 30% 40%ARAM FAM kNN BoosT.

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the 


root label in the hierarchies of the ART networks.

All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
