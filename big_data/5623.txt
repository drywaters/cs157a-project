 de-CH  de-CH  Abstract  A Command and Data Handling \(C&DH\system is being developed as part of a series of CubeSat missions being built at the University of Texas at Austin Texas Spacecraft Laboratory TSL With concurrent development of four missions and with more missions planned for the future the C&DH team is developing a system architecture that can support a variety of mission requirements The presented research aims to establish a reference for the development of the C&DH system architecture so that it can be reused for future university missions The C&DH system is designed using a centralized architecture with one main flight computer controlling the actions and the state of the satellite A commercial off-t he shelf system 
on module embedded computer running a Linux environment hosted on an interface board designed in-house is used as the platform for the mission software An integral component of the C&DH system development is the flight software FSW   The FSW is written in C using the Object-oriented architectural style It is structured as a state machine  controlling the transitioning of the satellite between its operational modes which define its actions and behaviour. The various testing procedures that are performed on the FSW, the C&DH system and the integrated satellite are described. These procedures include traditional software tests such as black box  glass box and unit testing as well as formal spacecraft tests such as Command Execution Tests and Dayin the-Life tests The design of the flight software and the associated hardware 
are integral components of the current missions in the TSL which when flown will be some of the most operationally complex CubeSat missions attempted to date  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  C URRENT O VERVIEW OF MISSIONS 1  3  C&DH  R EQUIREMENTS  3  4  C&DH  A RCHITECTURE  3  5  C&DH  F LIGHT S OFTWARE D ESIGN 5  6  FSW  T ESTING 9

meets a standard volume interface more common The Texas Spacecraft Lab \(TSL\, a university satellite lab at The University of Texas at Austin UT-Austin is currently performing several different CubeSat missions The more complex mission requirements from the current missions are driving the need to put more emphasis on the design of the C&DH system. The experience gained by past missions has also made obvious the need to create a re-u sable C&DH  Th is  paper aims at describing this effort and promoting the reuse of the C&DH system through its design elements  The objective of  this paper is to establish a  reference for the development of the 
C&DH system and to provide an example case study which can be used to assist similar satellite programs   The paper begins with a description of the current missions in progress at the TSL that incorporate the presented C&DH design  As the TSL is working on these missions concurrently the C&DH subsystem was designed with reusability as one of the non-functional requirements The system should then sa tisfy the technical requirements of the multiple current and future TSL missions Th e current requirements for the subsystem are presented in detail  The FSW and the spacecraft will undergo extensive testing for validation before launch The test procedures that are 
currently being performed in preparation for delivery of the upcoming spacecraft are presented. Furthermore, the future work required before delivery is also discussed    2  C URRENT O VERVIEW OF MISSIONS  A satellite is designated as a CubeSat if it meets the requirements outlined in the CubeSat Design Specification A 1U CubeSat form factor is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm However CubeSats can be 1U 2U 3U 6U or other sizes but must weigh less than 1.33 kg pe r 1 U under the current standard   Th e TSL is currently developing the spacecraft 


    2  bus for three 3U CubeSat missions simultaneously which are known as RACE Bevo-2 and ARMADILLO  The C&DH system design that is presented in this paper will be used for the se  missions  A brief overview of each of these missions is provided below    RAC E RACE Radiometer Atmospheric Cubesat Experiment is a 3U CubeSat developed in collaboration with Jet Propulsion Lab JPL  who will provide the radiometer payload The  an in April 2013. The primary mission objective of RACE is to advance the technology readiness level of the radiometer instrument thereby reducing the risk for future missions   T h e  s y s t e m  includes a 35 nm Indium Phosphide low noise amplifier LNA\ at the front-end, and will be the first millimeter wave radiometer to be flown on a CubeSat [5      The TSL is responsible for building and testing the CubeSat bus overseeing the payload integration and managing the ground segment including data collection RACE will be launched in 2014 into an ISS altitude orbit, and will have a planned operational lifetime of approximately 6 months   Bevo-2  Bevo-2 is UT-A  that is part of the second mission of the LONESTAR Low Earth Orbiting Navigation Experiment for Spacecraft Testing Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking program This program sponsored by NASA's Johnson Space Center JSC is a collabora tive project between the TSL at UT-Austin and the AggieSat Lab at Texas A&M University 6    I t s  a i m  i s  t o provide an opportunity for research in low-cost autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations techniques and to promote aero sp ace engineering education [7    T h e  pr o j e c t  i s  composed of a series of demonstration missions  Each mission includes one satellite built by each school leading up to the final mission objective of demonstrating autonomous rendezvous and docking between the two cooperative spacecraft. Each of the missions of the program demonstrates new technologies and operations that are necessary to achieve the final mission. The technologies to be evaluated as the primary objective of Bevo-2 are featured  GN&C module including a miniaturized star-tracker developed in-house, an in-house designed cold gas thruster  and an integrated 3 degreeof freedom ADC module     ARMADILLO Another satellite known as ARMADILLO Atmosphere Related Measurements And Detection of submILLimeter Objects  niversity Nanosatellite Program \(UNP\ competition sponsored by the US Air Force The primary objective of this mission is to characterize sub-millimeter diameter dust and debris particles that are present in low Earth orbit. ARMADILLO features a Piezoelectric Dust Detector \(PDD\ being built by Baylor University that will detect the particles upon impact with the instrument The impact will produce an electric charge which will be recorded and stored by the PDD until the C&DH computer queries the instrument The data is then post-processed and provided to atmospheric models which will improve the knowledge of the sub-millimeter space debris environment [8       Spacecraft Modular Design One of the strategies used by the TSL for developing multiple spacecraft with varied mission objectives is using a modular spacecraft structure bus design \(Figure 1  The TSL has implemented the concept of modularity in several layers of its hardware design The hardware architecture of ARMADILLO RACE and Bevo-2  structures are very similar. All three satellites are organized the same with three modules known as the Service module the GNC module and the P ay load module The modules are functionally similar although they differ in capabilities depending on the mission requirements  For Bevo-2 and ARMADILLO each module is 1U whereas RACE has 1.5U dedicated to the Payload module    Figure 1. Modular View of RACE \(top\ and ARMADILLO \(bottom\ satellites  Each module of the satellite serves a specific purpose. With this design each module can be developed simultaneously with minimal dependence on the other modules Tw o of these modules, the Service and the GNC, are used for each satellite with only minimal necessary changes  It was decided to mimic this concept of modularity in the software architecture as well so that subsystems as a whole both hardware and software could be outright replaced by an entirely different version of the subsystem Since all control and data transfer is routed through the C&DH system, a functioning subsystem comprising of the hardware components and the software necessary to operate it 


    3  ac cordingly can then be completely replaced without affecting the rest of the satellite   3  C&DH  R EQUIREMENTS  The requirements of each of the missions the TSL is working on are widespread, differing in criteria such as the payload being flown, the quantity of mission and health data generated and downlinked satellite attitude control and determination requirements, and subsystems included in the spacecraft The C&DH system must be designed so that it can satisfy these diverse set of requirements with a minim al  amount of necessary modifications per mission Therefore the C&DH system design was derived from a set of requirements specific to the subsystem that would ensure the fulfillment of all three sets of mission objectives. These requirements are shown in Table 1  4  C&DH  A RCHITECTURE  Based on lessons learned from previous TSL missions a centralized architecture is employed for the FSW of the satellites. A centralized architecture involves all subsystems of the satellite having a pointto point interface with only the C&DH subsystem Therefore all data and commands are sent only between the C&DH system and one other subsystem. This architecture is suitable for satellite systems with a small number of distinct subsystems. Employing this architecture is reliable in the sense that if one system fails during operations the effect of the failure is minimized as there is no direct interface with the other systems other than C&DH 9    T h us   t h e  i n t e gr i t y  o f  t h e  s e pa r a t e  i n t e r f a c e s  between the C&DH and the other subsystems should remain intact Furthermore the employment of this architectural style allows for code reuse that was flown on Bevo satellite from the first installment of the LONESTAR program The FSW of Bevo-1 was fully functional and tested and therefore provided a good starting point for the software development for the current missions Requirement  Description  1. Provide 2 GB \(unformatted\ data storage  Each of the missions requires a substantial amount of on board storage for the scientific data from the payloads and telemetry data fro m the other subsystems In order to accommodate this need it was deemed necessary to utilize external and non volatile storage in the form of an SD card This requirement is considered met if the C&DH system successfully provides 2 GB of storage. This req uirement is fulfilled by ensuring that the C&DH computer can detect and mount an appropriately sized SD card during the boot up process and can write to and read from the card during the mission  2 Receive process and execute commands within the windo w of a UT Austin ground station pass  The missions are considered to be semi autonomous In other words the satellites will be able to execute some actions autonomously such as turning on and off various components based on conditions such as power levels  or automatically downlinking data based on information gathered by an on board GPS receiver However the satellites must also be able to process and execute commands that are uplinked from the ground station They must be able to provide responses to the se commands, if any, without a long time delay so that they are received by the commanding ground station within the same ground pass  3 Activate and begin executing scripted commands upon separation from launch vehicle  It is imperative to overall missi on success that the C&DH computer boots upon separation from the launch vehicle. If this does not happen then none of the other components will receive the commands necessary for satellite operations This requirement is considered met if the C&DH compute r successfully enters the Startup mode \(the initial mode\ of the FSW after launch vehicle separation  4. Manage all commands governing the state and actions of the satellite  The main responsibility of the C&DH system is to execute all of the operations t hat control the spacecraft The C&DH is the only subsystem that can change the state physical and software of the satellite All other subsystems are delegated tasks to complete independently but remain under the control of the C&DH system Therefore th e C&DH system has the responsibility of managing all other subsystems to execute the mission successfully. It must be able to interface with the various hardware components of the satellite by sending commands and receiving back acknowledgement of the requ ested actions, as well as health and scientific data  Table 1 C&DH Subsystem Requirements  


    4    Hardware  The C&DH subsystem is housed within the Service module along with the UHF/VHF radio and the Electrical Power System \(EPS  Two major components comprise the C&DH subsystem: the flight computer and the interface board   The C&DH system incorporates a SystemOn Module SOM flight computer which is the central processor for the entire satellite  A SOM also known as a computeron module is a sub-type of an embedded computer contained on a single circuit board that can be plugged into a carrier board 10    S OM s  c o m e  i n d i f f e r e n t  c o nf i gur a t i o n s   b ut  generally consist of a processor and standard input/output I/O capabilities 1 1    whi c h  c a n  b e  c o nf i g ur e d a n d  connected to other peripheral devices through the carrier board  Starting with a SOM as the processor of the C&DH system instead of designing the flight computer in-house has several advantages particularly for CubeSat missions The main advantage is that it simplifies the development of the C&DH hardware and allows for more time to be spent on developing well-written and well-tested operational FSW. A university lab has to deal with constraints on manpower and time Therefore taking the approach of using an off-theshelf embedded computer system for the C&DH computer saves time and effort that would be needed for electronic design at the processor level.  As SOMs already include the hardware and software necessary to provide computing functionality from the processor it saves time in not requiring the design of complex circuitry needed for proper computer interfacing [12    a n d pr o vi de s  a  l e v e l  o f  f l e xi b i li t y for multiple applications  Being professionally designed it also improves the reliability of the entire C&DH system. It reduces the risk associated with improper design which can lead to computer malfunctions in orbit and mission failure As SOMs are mass-produced COTS hardware that are readily available at a low cost they are a great option for university satellites that have budgetary constraints. Finally processing and computation power is not compromised as these SOM computers are powerful enough to control the whole satellite    A trade study was performed in order to select the computer used for the current satellite missions Based on the trade study, the selected SOM that best matched the requirements in pla  LPC3250   microprocessor consisting of a 266 MHZ ARM926EJS CPU core and Vector Floating Point \(VFP\ coprocessor, and a large set of peripherals 13    T h e  mi c r o pr o c e s s o r  i s  designed for low-power high-performance applications  CubeSat flight computers Important performance characteristics of the LPC3250 SOM are listed in Table 2 and a block diagram of the unit is shown in Figure 2   Table 2 LPC3250 SOM Performance Characteristics CPU Frequency \(Max  208 MHz  On Chip Memory  32 KB L1, 256 KB SRAM  DRAM  64 MB  NAND  64 MB  NOR  2 MB  EEPROM  32 kB  Available SD/SDIO/MMC Expansion  2  UART  7  RS 232  2  I2C  2  SPI/SSP  4  Power Consumption \(typical  372 mW  Power Supply  3.15 V   The Phytec LPC3250 allows for easy creation and modification of the Linux kernel through its well-supported Linux development environment known as Linux Target Image Builder LTIB LTIB is a tool for integrating the build and configuration of the software packages for an embedded Linux distribution [15    T h e  L P C 3250 a l l o w s  f o r  the use of Linux as the running operating system on the SOM This lends itself to a significant amount of customization in terms of the kernel and pre-existing software tools and libraries  The second major component is the hardware interface board. In this case, the interface board is a custom in-house developed design called Kesler a board that houses the flight computer and connects it to the peripheral devices and other components of the satellite The Kesler board was designed by the TSL at UT-Austin based on the needs of not only the C&DH system, but of the other subsystems as well The Kesler board houses the SD card acting as the main onboard storage device It contains a real time clock RTC with a temperature compensated crystal oscillator TCXO to keep accurate time when a GPS time measurement is not available  a temperature sensor, and switches which allow it to power off connected subsystems The Kesler board also contains a 100-pin breakout header which allows it to be modified for different missions by re-designing an attached daughter board    Software For the flight software the centralized architecture is employed with a component-based architectural style by  ponent or module  There is one module per subsystem, and the FSW is then composed of all the modules compiled together into one executable  Figure 3 illustrates the different modules that comprise the FSW for Bevo-2 and ARMADILLO. The  that it excludes the GPS and NVS components  


    5   Figure 3 Software Modules within the FSW The figure shows the C&DH subsystem in the center interacting with all other subsystems of the satellite indicated by the bidirectional arrows between modules  This subsystem modularity allows for parallel development of the flight software Interface control documents for each subsystem are created to govern the ir software interface and function al  requirements as needed by the C&DH system Since each subsystem only interacts with the C&DH system subsystems can then be developed in parallel with minimal interdependencies 1 0   This approach aids in dealing with constraints associated with a university lab such as lack of manpower. Subsystems can be developed at different rates allowing re-allocation of resources such as assigning people to a different subsystem that requires more manpower for completion  An advantage from this architecture can be found from observing the GPS receiver subsystem for the Bevo-2 and ARMADILLO missions RACE does not include GPS  Bevo single frequency DRAGON GPS receiver for the mission whereas the ARMADILLO mission will fly the dual frequency FOTON GPS receiver developed at UT-Austin  The FOTON and the DRAGON will provide the same GPS receiver functionalities such as GPS time position and velocity measurements for ARMADILLO and Bevo-2 respectively  Therefore from the perspective of the C&DH team the commands sent to the GPS receiver subsystem will be functionally similar for both the DRAGON and the FOTON The C&DH will also be able to acquire the data from the GPS and downlink it in the same fashion for measurement post-processing There may be added capabilities for either receiver that the other does not exhibit, such as the FOTON being able to acquire GPS L2 frequency data in addition to L1 data Ho wever, the majority of the functionality of the system remains consistent across the two different hardware components Therefore the high-level software interface between the C&DH and the GPS subsystem the same as othe r subsystems will require minimal significant modifications due to hardware component changes and replacements   5  C&DH  F LIGHT S OFTWARE D ESIGN  With three concurrent projects in the TSL that use the C&DH system, the driving goal behind the development of the flight software is to write code that can be used for Figure 2 Block Diagr a m of LPC 3250  1 4   


    6  separate missions with different payloads but have a common implementation structure The focus is to maximize the code reusability between these missions and future missions. This section describes the general software implementation that is used on each of the satellites  The object-oriented O-O architectural programming style has been used extensively in the architecture of the software The C&DH software has been written in C which supports object-oriented programming Each subsystem team has written their low-level code in either C or C but they are required to provide a high-level C wrapper that includes all the functions that the C&DH is able to call acting as the interface between the two subsystems Each wrapper includes the commanding functions Therefore each subsystem is represented as an object that interacts with the C&DH software Figure 4 illustrates the interface between the C&DH software and the subsystem software   Figure 4 Interface Object Software Interaction  The block on the right side of the figure represents the lowlevel code for a subsystem This is the code that directly interfaces with the physical hardware of that subsystem. The block on the left side of the figure represents the C&DH software entity of the FSW. The center block of the diagram is the subsystem component that acts as the interface between the C&DH software and the subsystem software Complete functionality is provided through this interface which is implemented by the respective subsystem in collaboration with the C&DH software   FSW State Machine  The following terms are used to describe important components of the C&DH software  Mode A mode is a particular state of the C&DH software system For each mode there are certain activities that are allowed to run  Transition A transition is a change from one mode to another that occurs according to specific rules  Activity An activity is a process that occurs in the context of one or more modes an activity may be continuous  LoopedActivity  or may run finitely  Activity   Activities are actions that occur multiple times in the flight software They are implemented as software threads within modes to perform specific tasks The C&DH flight software has a class named Activity which has a child class named LoopedActivity  The Activity  class will run through its actions once whereas the LoopedActivity   actions will be repeated at a specified interval based on one of its private variables  All of the  spacecraf  by the FSW implemented by the team responsible for the C&DH system. T he FSW was designed as a state machine The state machine is implemented as a class called ModeManager The ModeManager governs the switching of states between satellite software states called Modes  The switching between Modes  is caused by a change in another entity of the software, the transition variable The value of the transition variable is altered when certain conditions are met causing the ModeManager  to de-activate the current Mode  that the satellite software is running in and activate the new Mode     The ModeManager  places the satellite into a certain state which is designated as a Mode  in the C&DH FSW There are four Modes  defined for the FSW that the satellite can transition into Startup SU Automatic Command Execution \(ACE\, Low Power \(LP\ and Fail Safe \(FS\. The state chart shown in  Figure 5 illustrates the different software Modes  and the conditions to be met that causes transition between the Modes The Modes are represented as the oval boxes in Figure 5  Figure 5. State Diagram for Mode Manager of FSW The initialization of the state machine occurs once the flight computer has completed its boot sequence The ModeManager  then places the satellite into the Startup mode, where it can then transition between the other modes based on the transition variable The transition variable is represented by the arrows in the figure \(excluding the arrow from the initialization circle to the Startup mode as this transition is performed outside of the state machine    The first mode that is entered automatically after the FSW is  initiated is SU  This mode is slightly different than the other three modes in that it is mostly composed of actions that are a part of a one-time initialization process that occurs when the satellite powers on for the first time It will also be 


    7  automatically entered if the satellite reboots for any reason Therefore some actions will be skipped if it is determined in the software that the satellite had been previously in operation before the reboot  Once a timeout period before spacecraft radio transmission has been observed, the C&DH can then start the radio beacon activity This constitutes transmitting a short message formed by minimal health data over the radio. The health data activity is also commenced at this time This activity queries the various subsystems that are currently powered on and collects the health data produced by their hardware components. The health data is collected into multiple circular buffers that are large enough to hold data generated during a pre-determined time interval in the range of 1-2 hours The contents of the buffers are dumped to a file and transmitted to ground upon receipt of a ground command to do so Throughout the sequence of events in SU  if the power level is found to fall below a pre-defined limit, the satellite will transition into LP  automatically Transitioning back into SU occurs once the voltage returns above the limit If the battery voltage is maintained at an allowable level,  the satellite will transition to ACE after all the actions have been accomplished All transitions between modes will be logged on-board, and can be requested by the ground station if desired  ACE is the nominal mode of the satellite This mode involves executing the mission scripts that contain the commands necessary for completion of the mission phases and executing any commands that are uplinked by the ground station. This mode consists entirely of activities that are activated or deactivated based on ground commands, or autonomously based on acquired mission or health data Commands, or mission scripts, may either be uplinked from the ground or stored on the SD card before launch If the ModeManager initiates a transition to the LP it will know which command in the mission script it was processing prior to interruption. Upon return to ACE, the software will continue with the interrupted command unless otherwise directed from a ground command  LP is one of two safe modes for the satellite. LP is designed to be a catch-all for error scenarios aboard the satellite including the spacecraft having insufficient power LP  allows the satellite to enter a mode where only necessary activities are performed and basic commands can be executed. Health data for all powered subsystems continues to be gathered, and the beacon continues to be transmitted  The satellite will listen for any commands that are uplinked from the ground station However not all commands received from the ground will be executed by the spacecraft due to the limited power available LP is designed to be power positive in an average sense     The C&DH will also check for errors that are classified as critical. If the error detected that caused a transition to LP is critical then the satellite will enter FS   FS  only runs the minimum necessary activities for spacecraft survival  FS is the only mode that the satellite must transition out of via a ground command. It will always transition out of Fail Safe into LP  where the EPS voltage level will be checked and then can return to either SU or ACE The reason for this approach is to have one software mode which in the case of a critical error, all non-critical components will be powered off, and the satellite will remain this way until the mission operators decide the errors have been resolved and it is safe to proceed with the mission. This mode essentially removes all autonomous capabilities of the satellite with the exception of rebooting in the case of certain detected critical errors, thus preventing any undesired actions performed by the satellite. The mission operators also have the capability to command the satellite to transition into FS  FS mode is also designed to be power positive since non-essential satellite subsystems are turned off and are not operating   Main C&DH FSW Features In the following section some of the main functionalities that define the C&DH flight software are described These functionalities involve the high level responsibilities of the C&DH subsystem in order to maintain the operations of the satellite The implementation of the main functionalities in the FSW that allow for completion of the mission operations of the current TSL satellites include \(but are not limited to command processing error and fault detection satellite system recovery, and file management    Command Processing A large portion of the design of the FSW involves defining the ground station to satellite command processing architecture. Any uplinked file will have a header line at the beginning of the file which indicates whether the commands are to be executed immediately \(known as a command file to be treated as the commands contained in a new replacement mission script or to be treated as the commands contained in a time-stamped mission script for execution at a future time  In the FSW there are several activities that each play a role in executing commands that are uplinked from the ground station namely CheckUplinkActivity  CommScheduler Activity  MissionScriptActivity   InterruptBufferActivity  and OpsCommands  Each of these activities is a class that has one object created upon execution of the FSW and is not destroyed during runtime Figure 6  illustrates a sequence diagram showing the interaction of these activities which are  commands  The CheckUplinkActivity  CUA is the primary activity involved in querying the UHF/VHF radio to determine if any new input has been received from ground Currently this activity runs as a LoopedActivity If it is determined that new data has been uplinked from the ground station the ac tivity will first halt the beacon as well as the mission script scheduler the Co mmScheduler  object in Figure 6  and the mission script executor \(the mission script object in 


    8  Figure 6   The CUA will then make a call to start the InterruptBufferActivity  IBA thread The CUA will reactivate the beacon and mission script-related activities only after it receives a signal that the IBA thread has stopped running, or if no new commands have been received by the satellite for over a time period that is hard coded into the software  The IBA thread is responsible for placing the  commands into a temporary buffer, and for calling the thread that maps the commands into the corresponding actions that are to be taken by the satellite, known as OpsCommands represented by the CommandMap object in Figure 6   When the IBA thread is started by the CUA object  the commands from the uplinked file are copied into the IBA  o determine the proceeding command processing steps. If the header indicates that the commands are to be executed immediately CommandMap  will be called once for each command until all commands have been executed If the header indicates that the file is a new mission script the IBA object will place the commands into a mission file for use by the Mission Script Activity   mission script object in Figure 6\ when it is reactivated. If the uplinked file contains the header indicating a time-stamped mission script the commands are stored and will be used in the future by the same IBA object  A command file validator is integrated into the ground station/satellite communication process in order to ensure the authenticity of uplinked files. All files that are uplinked to the satellite are authenticated on-board before any attempt is made to interpret the contents  The command file validation process similar to the FSW integrity checking software discussed in the next section, is performed by generating hash strings using a cryptographic hash function  hash itself can vary The string is generated from a secret key that is hard-coded into both the FSW and the ground station software Strings generated on board are compared to the ones appended to the end of uplinked files If the strings are identical, the spacecraft will interpret and process the newly uplinked command file  If the strings do not match, then the file is ignored and deleted, and an indication of receiving a non-authorized file is logged   Satellite System Recovery One major concern of having the FSW encompassed into one program is possible corruption of the executable file Single-event effects can be caused by ionizing radiation damage to the flight computer and other electronic components of the satellite due to the space environment and must be considered when developing the C&DH subsystem The events include single-event upsets SEU single-event latchups SEL and single-event burnouts S EB\ [9      Redundancy of the FSW has been used to mitigate the effects of program corruption. Two redundant copies of the FSW executable are stored on-board  one copy on the NAND flash memory and the other on the SD card Upon boot up of the flight computer, a script will be executed to  check the integrity of the primary executable against the two backup copies. The integrity checking process is outlined in the diagram shown in Figure 7   Figure 6 Sequence Diagram for On board Command Processing  


    9    The validation of the FSW integrity is performed through a cryptographic hash function to generate a hash string for each of the three executables   Error and Fault Detection The satellite is expected to experience errors during on-orbit operations During software development the C&DH team is responsible for maintaining the master document that lists all pre-defined errors that can occur in the FSW These errors will be automatically logged on-board if they occur during flight Examples of pre-defined errors include the spacecraft not being able to open a file for reading or writing or the spacecraft receiving a parameter associated with a command that is out of bounds. Each subsystem lead is responsible for listing any FSW errors pertaining to their system in the master document, and ensuring that the error will be logged in subsystem code Included in the master error database document for each pre-defined error is a unique ID #, the name of the program files where this error could be created and the position of occurrence, the type of error \(for example a null file pointer or an I2C write error and the actions the satellite should take if any to resolve the error. The responsible party for inputting the error into the document can also include information on how the ground station operator would resolve the error Some  lity to complete the mission requirements, and may require a reset of the satellite in order to be resolved, which is indicated in the document as well   Two on-board error databases were created to keep track of any such errors that the satellite experiences throughout the mission The databases are implemented in the FSW usin g the SQLite 3 software library. The first database placed onboard will be used for logging errors that are referenced in a file containing all the possible error IDs, and any subsequent autonomous actions that the satellite should take The second error database is a log that is populated as errors occur This second log can be requested by the ground station to see if any FSW errors have occurred so that appropriate ground actions for resolution can be taken   File Management The Kernel and the root file system Rootfs are stored on the NAND flash memory of the flight computer. The Rootfs is the Linux root file directory for the FSW. The Kernel and the Rootfs including Hookem are stored and booted from the NAND flash as opposed to the NOR flash or the SD card The NOR flash is not used as the FSW file in its current state is 4 MB in size and would not fit on the NOR flash The FSW is not stored on the SD card in case there are any problems encountered related to mounting functions or corrupted SD cards and therefore any problems with the SD card will not result in complete mission failure   All mission data generated by the payloads for each mission as well as all health data will be stored on the external SD card. Separate directories will be created on the SD card to maintain an organized file system to facilitate the transmission and storage of generated mission data The naming convention for generated files will be kept uniform across subsystems to minimize differences in the manner of requesting files from the ground To prevent the SD card from being a single-point failure for the data storage system a spacecraft command will be able to change the future data storage location from the SD card to the NAND flash on the LPC3250   6  FSW  T ESTING  The FSW is currently going through the testing phase of the development cycle where techniques are employed for validation and verification of the C&DH system The tests range from subsystem-specific functional tests to D ay in the-Life simulations on both the flat sat engineering test bed and the fully integrated satellite  In order to verify the functionality of the C&DH system it  upcoming satellite missions The TSL has implemented the practice of performing tests on the satellite software and hardware throughout the development process Testing commenced early in the FSW development cycle on individual software classes for a specific hardware Figure 7 Flow Chart of Process for FSW Integrity Checker

Unit testing involves testing each separate unit of a software program on its own to ensure that it meets its specification 1 6    F o r  t h e  C  D H s o f t wa r e  each class was tested as a separate unit Black box and glass box testing are common test techniques employed for testing engineering software products, and these were performed on each class Once the implementation of a class was completed a document was generated to  record the results of both tests  For the majority of the classes, the correct functionality was confirmed through the performance of these tests In some cases, when coming up with the test cases, the C&DH team could recognize an error in the method before running the tests In the case of the black box testing if the tester was the person who wrote the method, they would recognize that a particular scenario or a set of inputs was not considered during implementation and that the method would not respond correctly Therefore the tester could then update the code in order to handle this case correctly and the test case is considered passed It might have been beneficial to ensure that the tester was not the same person as the developer in order to get a better idea on how many of the test cases would have failed without implementing fixes concurrently However the goal of the tests is to identify failure points for each method, and this was accomplished   Ground Station Graphical User Interface  To aid in the testing phase of the development process for the TSL a ground station Graphical User Interface GS GUI was developed by the C&DH team to act as the  rface with the satellite during integrated system testing, as well as flight operations. Work on the GS GUI commenced in 2012 and new functionality continues to be added to the software over time Versions of the GS GUI have been used for past satellite software and hardware demonstrations, as well as tools for performing FSW testing including the Command Execution Tests \(CET\ and Dayin the-Life tests  The objective of the GUI is to minimize the effort required for the ground station operator to interact with the satellite during the testing phase and for flight. The GUI meets this objective by allowing the user to generate mission scripts and command files by inputting their selections through buttons or drop-down lists It also provides enhanced situational awareness by presenting data to the software operator in a contextually relevant manner  The command window is where the user can create a mission script or a command file, and select the commands that will populate the file A screen shot of the current version of the command window is shown in Figure 8  The file to be uplinked is generated automatically by the ground  ns The command queue box located on the right side of the window shows the data that will be written to the command file  an aid for checking for the correct op-codes to be sent to the satellite The data is shown before slip encapsulation and before the hash string for command file validation is appended Figure 8   The Command Window of the GS GUI  


    11  Up on transmission, the GUI generates two files to be saved on the host computer. The first file generated contains the raw data that is transmitted to the satellite in the exact format that is uplinked. The second file is a human readable file which contains the names of the commands that are included in the uplink file. This file can be quickly scanned by the user to view which commands were included in a past command file or mission script. Allowing the GS GUI to populate the file with the op-codes and restricting the user to the buttons and menus on the command window reduces the risk of transmitting an incorrect list of commands to the satellite as the formatting of the command file or mission script is performed by the GUI  The telemetry window displays some of the data that is downlinked by the satellite The GUI is used for receiving satellite beacons health telemetry and mission data downlinked in response to a sent command The data received from the satellite is saved onto the ground station computer and timestamped with the ground time The telemetry window then parses the data received from the satellite and displays either certain fields of the parsed downlinked data or a message indicating that mission data has been received and saved on ground  Another useful feature of the command file generation capability of the GS GUI is the capability to communicate with the flat sat either through radio transmission or through a UART interface The flat sat comprises similar hardware and electrical connections as those included in the flight version of the satellite, but it is laid out flat on a surface for easier accessibility while testing All formal tests are first conducted on the flat sat before they are attempted on the  sat, consisting of the Bevo-2 versions of hardware, is shown in Figure 9   Figure 9  Flat Sat used for C&DH and Full FSW Testing  The GUI allows the user to specify the method of communication This feature has been useful during software testing with the flat sat when radio transmission is not possible    7  F UTURE W ORK  With the launch of RACE in 2014 and Bevo-2  and ARMADILLO upcoming in 2015  there is a sizeable amount of work remaining to complete the flight build and testing for these satellites This section outlines the tasks that the C&DH team will complete in  preparation for satellite delivery   Command Execution Testing The next major step to be performed in the FSW testing process is the Command Execution Test. The purpose of the C ET  is to validate every command that can be uplinked to the spacecraft 1 7    T hi s  i s  t o  h e l p  pr e ve n t  t h e  gr o un d station from sending a command that can place the satellite into an unknown state and jeopardize its integrity The results generated in this test can then be used to identify and compare wit h the satellite actions that are taken during flight  The test is designed to be executed with the FSW running on the integrated satellite and with the hardware reacting to the uplinked commands. Therefore, the CET will not only test for any bugs or defects in the FSW, but it will test the various software and electrical interactions between all the components of the integrated satellite    The CET will be the first test with the fully integrated satellite that involves utilizing the endto end operation of  Therefore the CET has added importance in that it will also test the integration of  software The interface between the COM and the C&DH software is critical, as a failure in receiving or transmitting data for the satellite will lead directly to mission failure as no data will be collected The test is designed to involve commanding the satellite in as similar a process to flightlike conditions as possible thereby maximizing the detection of possible errors and defects that can be encountered while in orbit. To date, most of the preparation time of the FSW for the CET has been on integrating the COM code with the FSW   Dayin the-Life Testing Upon completion of the CET the next tests to perform on the integrated satellite are scenario tests and Dayin the-Life tests These tests are designed to simulate in-flight events and activities the satellite will experience Similar to the CET, these tests will only pass data in and out of the FSW by means that will be used during flight operations The purpose of these tests is to verify the functionality of the fully integrated satellite while it is performing various sequences of flight operations  The DITL tests are the last type of tests to be run on the satellite before it is delivered for launch vehicle integration Each mission phase for the particular satellite under test must be fully executed and in the correct order As the lifetime of the current TSL satellites range from 6 months to 2 years the DITL tests 


    12  will be an accelerated simulation of the mission The test should also force the satellite to enter and operate in all of its FSW modes including LP  and FS  Therefore the test should simulate situations where the satellite does not have enough power to accomplish the commands included in the current mission script or command file or where the satellite experiences a critical failure when attempting to execute a command    8  C ONCLUSION  The presented C&DH system was developed to meet the multiple requirements and capabilities of  the current and future missions of the UT-Austin TSL Designing the system around a COTS SOM as the flight computer running a Linux environment and implementing the FSW in C using O-O techniques allows for a software architecture using a component-based architectural style. Structuring the FSW in a modular manner where each subsystem is treated as a component that interacts with the central flight computer provides advantages such as subsystem upgradability and interchangeability As with any new system, thorough and well-planned testing is an integral step in the development process, requiring just as much effort as the implementation The tests included in validating the C&DH system such as the Command Execution test and the Dayin the-Life test are executed on both the flat sat and flight unit. Leading up to satellite delivery of the Bevo2 and RACE spacecraft in early 2014, the emphasis for the C&DH team will be on completing this testing in order to validate the FSW before flight unit delive ry   R EFERENCES      Apland, Clint T., Rogers Q.
