Its unscheduled removal is considered as the most disruptive and costly maintenance activity besides operational non availability. Like other flying machines 
its defects are documented by all users on regular basis It is usually followed by trend analysis to investigate solutions for preventable problems e s earch ers  have observed that an entire engine fleet assessment could be done on the basis of data collection being done when these are removed for any reason v er th e  past few decades a considerable importance is also given to factors such as components\222 aging, number of  1 978-1-4799-1622-1/14/$31.00 \2512014  IEEE repairs, its effectiveness, and imperfect maintenance inspection owing to poor skills of technicians [3 Historical data of engine defects has also been found to help in advance planning for required personnel, tools 
equipment and spares support to speed up maintenance through  minimal costs. In these engines, maximum stress and strain has been found in compressor and turbine blades on leading edge, trailing edge and blade tip locations due to continuous variation in pressure and thermal loading [4 d i e s o n its m a i n te n a n ce management observed that a good quality maintenance effort could lead to reduction in manpower while hence reducing its labor cost v i a t i on  m a i n t e n a n c e  enterprises are also expected to pay more attention to quality and stability of their services due to peculiar nature of helicopter operations as compared to fixed wing aircraft T h eref ore u s ers h a v e s t arted to w a rds

Procedures like Condition Based Maintenance \(CBM\d Prognostic and Health Management \(PHM\techniques [7 ha ve a l so b e c o m e  very common phenomenon. Investigations into engine performance have shown that reliability of a gas turbine engine could be assessed through analysis of its EGTM degradation. Take-off EGTM has been defined as margin between the value of EGT and the full-power take-off peak EGT at a sea-level airport [8  In present research; maintenance history data of numerous T 53 engines was collected for statistical 
analysis. Its aim was to observe any special trends for maintenance crew and operators to devise preventive maintenance strategies or establish inventory levels of critical components, assemblies and systems 2 METHODOLOGY  Present research was carried out through following steps  1  Aircraft maintenance history records were reviewed and data segregated into three categories. The categories are referred to as 221engine types\222 in this paper and nominated as 


  2 221Retired Engines\222, \22110 Years or Older\222 and 221Less than 5 Years Old\222  2  Defects were categorized into four levels of repair, i.e. \221Field Repairable\222, \221Minor Repair\222 221Shop Repairable\222 and \221Major Repair\222. These four defect types will be referred to as \221fault categories\222  3  Then data tables were prepared according to fault category of all three engine types for analysis  4  Zero defects were observed in a number of fields for various types of engines. These were also included in analysis for subsequent comparative analysis 5  A number of statistical tools were applied over the data to arrive at inferences to establish trends and forecast future requirements  The analysis of data and inferences are discussed in subsequent paragraphs over different years of operation of these engines 4 FIELD REPAIRABLE DEFECTS  During First 5 Years of Operation  d\d 2\(a\o \(d\how how the three engine types behaved during their respective first five years of operation. It is evident that \221Less than 5 Years Old\222 engines gave maximum problems, the \22110 Years or Older\222 category had fewer and the \221Retired\222 ones have been a source of least concern during their 1 st five years of operation  1 \(a  1\(b   1\(c   1\(d  Figures 1\(a\o \(d\ield Repairable Faults in 3 Engine Categories during First 5 Years of Operation  2\(a

Whereas; new engines developed defects that took more time, effort and finances to repair. Such faults also resulted in increased down time of the effected engines as in figures 5\(a b During Last 5 Years Here we see slightly different situation than that given by each engine type during its respective first five years. While \22110 Years or Older\222 engines encountered fewer faults, the \221Retired\222 ones had to struggle with rising \221Turbine Gas Temperatures\222 and their \221Hot End\222 sides as shown in figures 6\(a\ & \(b   Figure 5 a\227Shop Repairable Faults in 3 Engine Categories during 1st 5 Years of Operation   Figure 5\(b  Major Faults in 3 Engine Categories during 1st 5 Years of Operation   Figure 6\(a  Shop Repairable Faults in 3 Engine Categories during Last 5 Years 0f Operation   Figure 6 \(b  Major Faults in 3 Engine Categories during Last 5 Years of Operation  6  D ATA A NALYSES  Present research was aimed at prediction of future fault trends. Therefore results are discussed in two independent parts; as first  five years of operation and the last five years. It also enabled researchers to arrive at minor and major fault categories  Field Repairable or Minor defects A review of results for  minor level faults during first five as well as last five years, lead to following inferences 1  The data pertaining to oldest engines, the \221Retired\222 ones, present least number of field repairable or 


  5 minor faults. So little available record was sifted through to find out the reason. It transpired that these engines had been subjected to minimal operation during their first five years of induction Consequently there were minimal faults 2  These engines saw increased activity during the last five years of their operation and that brought an increase in the minor \(or running\ faults 3  The \22110 Years or Older\222 ones, when installed on the flying machines, had to straight away face substantial number of running hours and therefore encountered similar rise in \221running\222 faults 4  When these engines entered in their second five years term of operation, the flying activity increased further. That brought proportionate increase in the numbers and type of minor faults that had to be removed 5  The engines with \221Less than 5 Years\222 in service came during extensive activity period and therefore encountered highest number of field repairable or minor defects 6  221Less than 5 Years Old\222 engines are still in their first five years term and therefore all entries against these under the \221Last 5 Years\222 period are ZEROs Shop Repairable or Major defects   Review of the major defects in first five and last five years showed following results  1  221Retired Engines\222 never presented a shop repairable fault but had a few major defects during their first 5 years of operation 2  On the contrary during their last 5 years in operation \(which came some 10-15 years after their induction in service\ese engines had substantial increase in \221Shop Repairable\222 faults And against the \221Major\222 fault category, these were the only engines sent for depot level maintenance 3  Shop repairable problems were observed at the same level for \22110 Years or Older\222 category as well as for the newer engines during their first 5 years of operation 4  Shop Repairable or Major defects against the newest engines has been NIL \(No defect\ seen against the last 5 years period, since these engines are still in their first 5 years of life 5  No Major faults were observed among \22110 Years or Older\222 engines during operational life even in extensive operations and extreme environment conditions. This fact confirmed that T-53 engines could operate for upto 10-15 years without a need of \221Depot Level Maintenance\222 6  T-53 engines were observed to be prone to major defects due to aging and not the operational activity that would result intoDepot Level Maintenance  7  F INDINGS  Present investigations lead us to the following findings about maintenance needs of T-53 engines 1  Running i.e. \221Field Repairable\222 or \221Minor\222 faults increase as the operational activity of T-53 engines increases 2  Faults causing increased down-time i.e. \221Shop Repairable\222 or \221Major\222 types are not so pronounced during first 10 years life of engines in operation 3  With aging; engines can encounter more number of major faults, despite increased dormant periods 4  Fewer faults necessitating Depot Level maintenance may be encountered even after 10 years of T-53 engines in service 5  Better maintenance and operations practices of T53 engines could considerably reduce the number of major as well as minor defects in engines 6  Modifications and upgrades in the assemblies of T-53 engines have contributed towards their improved performance in the later versions  8  R ECOMMENDATION  In view of above discussion, following recommendations are proffered for trouble-free use and decreased down-time of T-53 engines for users  1  Present research may be extended to evaluate exact type and quantity of spares required for the above as well as other minor and major defects 2  Inventories of spares may be held according to individual user requirements for defects predicted for further operation of these engines 3  Based on the performance of engines and its fault trends; limited procurement of spares may be needed for Depot Level maintenance 4  A skills development program may be initiated for development of human resource for operating and maintaining these engines  


  6 9  C ONCLUSION  Present research has provided a comprehensive review of T 53 engines which have remained in operation with one of its users for over 15 years. The lessons learnt in terms of minor and major defects have been shared Some of the major systems and components have been identified that contribute to major and minor faults in these engines. It has been observed that the defects are directly proportional to aging of the engines rather than its frequency or number of hours of operation. The data reviewed was of retired as well as in service engines.This research may be extended to collect maximum information on the international sources that can help in addressing problems in these engines to provide various alternatives for using these engines for next 10-15 years  R EFERENCES  1  Mark A Powell, Richard C Millar; \223Method for Investigating Repair/ Refurbishment Effectiveness\224 2011 IEEE, 978-1-4244-7351-9/11, Pages 1 to 15  J o h n R   Ger h ard; \223 E n g i n e Fleet R el i abil it y  Dat a Management Optimization\224, 2011 IEEE, 978-14244-8856-8/11   S a qi b Ha m eed, Ir f a n  A Ma narv i   223 U s i ng F EM a n d  CFD to Locate Cracks in Compressor Blades for Non Destructive Inspections\224, IEEEAC paper#1651 Version4, updated Nov, 19, 2008, Page 1 to 11 4  Mar k  A P o w el l R i c h ar d C Millar   223Met h o d f o r  Investigating Repair/ Refurbishment Effectiveness\224 2011 IEEE, 978-1-4244-7351-9/11, Pages 1 to 15  Jer m y D.
