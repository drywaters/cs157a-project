 An Improvement Apriori Arithmetic based on Rough set Theory Chen Chu-xiang, Shen Jian-jing, Chen Bing, Shang Chang-xing, Wang Yun-cheng Zhengzhou Institute of Information Science and Technology,  Zhengzhou,  Henan, China xx_ccx@126.com  Abstract Rough set theory and the association rules algorithm are mining methods which are used to find implicit rules model from large amounts of data. As the association rules mining algorithm, Apriori algorithm is gotten a lot of application used for its easy use. However in practice, it often enco untered some problem as low mining efficiency, too many invalid rules acquired and the rules of pattern mining disorder. In this paper, a algorithm called R_Apriori is designed for the problems with decision-making domain. First the conditions of the 
cores are mined with the rough attribute reduction algorithm, then 1-frequent item sets and the corresponding sample set is found with use mining cores set by the Apriori algorithm. And then multi-stage frequent item sets and th e corresponding support and confidence can be obtained by the sample collection intersection operator According to degree of confidence and support the corresponding strength of the rule is decided. R_Apriori algorithm solves the problems of Apriori algorithm to improve the efficiency of the algorithm and is in promotion on a certain significance Keywords: Apriori Arithmetic, Rough Set Theory Reduction, Frequent Sets, Algorithm Efficiency  1  P REAMBLE  Data mining is a method for search the knowledge and implicit rules in large amounts of data.. It is both a data processing and a knowledge acquisition technique. The 
technology evolved from artificial intelligence, so the results of artificial intelligence can be transplanted to the data mining system, such as the traditional statistics, clustering decision tree, set theory, associ ation rules, rough set theory artificial neural network, genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing, etc 1  Rough Set Theory can find structured relationship of inaccurate data or noisy data, which is based on a equivalence class establishment with the given training data As a method to find any modes, association rules is common concerned. The Apriori algorithm based association rule is continue to improve by scholars as it\222s more simple 2-4  However, Apriori algorithm often faces the difficulties in 
process of the association rules discovery as follows 1\While using of data mining association rules, the mining item sets generally are not limited to so to dig out a wider range of rules. But it will also lead to too many invalid rule excavated and to bury really useful mode under the valid rules 2\Time complexity and space complexity of Apriori algorithm is increased as the exponential level with the increase of the item set, and acquirement of x-frequent item sets is needed to scan all data. So how to improve the efficiency of their time and space is one of the focus of the study by Scholars 3\priori algorithm can dig out the effectively rule mode. But in some practical problems, it needs to dig out either the rules model or the order of the rules to find its associated intensity level 
In many practical cases, especially in decision-making problems, decision set is clear. Under the premise of the clear decision-making domain, it is necessary to improve Apriori algorithm to address the efficiency of mining algorithms and validity and strength sorted of model rules 2 T HEORY FOUNDATION  Improved algorithm is mainly based on rough set theory and Apriori association rules algorithm, the basic knowledge as follows  2.1 Rough Set Theory In 1982, Poland mathematician Pawlak proposed ro ugh set theory. Any information system \(or information sheet\n rough set theory called I can be describe with an ordered 4-tuple U  A, V, f where 
U = {x 1 x 2  x n  are all limited collection of samples A=C D is a set of all finite number of attributes C is condition attributes set that is the characteristics of the object D is the decision attribute set that is the type of study object and C D  Suppose a is either an attribute x i is either an object, then f \(x i a is value  of x i in a 
attribute, while V is the value range of attribute A  4-5  Pawlak attribute importance reduction algorithm confirms mainly the importance of the attribute based on the information system changes in size classification ability while it removed.

 First introduce the data mining association rules, association rules discovery data mainly to an interesting correlation between item sets like A ==> B such a law can be extended for the A 1 A 2 A n B 1 B 2 B n  class rule. Can be understood as in the database to find A 1 A 2 A n also exist B 1 B 2 B n the same time, the establishment of rules Concrete realization depends on the degree of interest rules, including those of support and confidence of two terms Degree of support \(support S refers to the transaction in the rules the frequency X Y degree of support for S to S \(X ==> Y\ = | T \(XUY\ | / | T  Where T \(XUY refers to the number of transactions of the data set contains XUY  T the total number of that matters Degree of support is too low, said the rules are not general Degree of confidence \(confidence C said association rule X ==> Y intensity, defined as C \(X ==> Y\ = | T \(XUY\ / | T \(X  Where T \(XUY refers to the data set contains transactions number of XUY  T \(X said data set that contains transactions number of X The lower the confidence level that the credibility of the rules of difference Association rule X ==> Y means that the confidence level of X given Y, that is the conditional probability, that is C \(X ==> Y\ = P \(Y / X  Data mining association rules is found to have a user-specified minimum support degree S min and minimum confidence degree C min of association rules. Namely X ==> Y is equivalent to S \(==> Y\> S min C \(X Y\> C min   7  3  I MPROVEMENT R_A PRIORI A LGORITHM D ESCRIPTION  To the the problem with clear decision-making field by mining association rules, improved R_Apriori algorithm can be form by integrating rough set theory with the Apriori algorithm to solve the problem raised in the preamble as follows About the problem of the efficiency of Apriori algorithm and the validity of the mining rules on account of the large amount of attributes set, we can first get the nuclear of attribute set by rough set attribute reduction, then the association rule mining to the nuclear data. In certain extent it can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of mining For inefficient Apriori algorith m raised from the needs of scanning all attribute sets to obtain each frequent attribute set, we can solve as follow 1\1-frequency set can be obtained by scanning the set of attributes, which assumed to be L 1 X 1 1 X 1 2 X 1 M   Denote the set of samples of X 1 P as S\(X 1 P t 1 P t 2 P t m P  1<P<M Obviously the number of the element of S\(X 1 P  is transactions number, namely S\(X 1 P  and S\(X 1 P T S min   S min  is minimum support degree 2\ 2-frequent set and above 2-frequency set can be obtained just by set operations of 1-frequent set. According to the character of frequent sets: the attribute which is not attribute of low frequency set must not be attribute of high frequency. So the attributes of 2-frequent sets must include the frequency set L 1 For any two item sets X 1 i and X 1 j in L 1  where 1<i,j<M  S\(X 1 i  S\(X 1 j  includes all transaction in X 1 i and X 1 j Then its number of elements namely S\(X 1 i   S\(X 1 j  is the number of its transactions. So if S\(X 1 i   S\(X 1 j T |> S min then X 1 i X 1 j  L 2 otherwise X 1 i X 1 j  L 2 then intersection operation to all 1-frequency set and to get their support, you can get L 2 if X 1 i X 1 j  L 2 you can also calculate S\(X 1 i  S\(X 1 j S\(X 1 i  and S\(X 1 i  S\(X 1 j  S\(X 1 j  which is the confidence of X 1 j X 1 i and X 1 i  X 1 j And comparison with the minimum confidence degree C min association rules is determined 3\Thus intersection operation to the frequent item sets  L K-1 and L 1 and then determines the number of elements in the intersection set, all frequent sets L K  can be obtained. For the problem of the sort of strength of the rule model, it could be sorted by support degree, confidence degree and order of mining Given two rules r i and r j  r i r j i.e r i precedes r j or r i has higher precedence over r j f one of the following holds good 1\e confidence degree of r i is greater than that of r j  2\heir confidences degree are the same but support of r i  is greater than that of r j  3\oth the confidences and supports of r i  and r j  are the same, but r i  is generated before r j   The algorithm described as follows U = RS\(U,C,D,f attribute reduction according to decision set L\(1\ = Apriori\(U,1\= {X 1 1 X 1 2 X 1 M  Calculate 1-frequency set S\(X 1 P t 1 P t 2 P t m P  1<P<M record of 1-frequency set transaction sets k=2 Do while L\(k\=null L\(k For i=1 to | L\(k-1 For P=1 to  | L\(1 If X 1 P E\(L\(k-1\\ then E\(L\(k-1\s\( k-1\ frequency set  If | S\(X 1 P  S\(E\(L\(k-1\\\| /| T |> S min then L\(k\ = L\(k\ U{ S\(X 1 P  S\(E\(L\(k-1 Is the elements of k-frequency set  If | S\(X 1 P  S\(E\(L\(k-1\\| /| S\(X 1 P C min then To determine whether S\(E\(L\(k-1\\(X 1 P e rule  R = R U{ S\(E\(L\(k-1\\ ==> S\(X 1 P  Sort\(R, S\(E\(L\(k-1\\ ==> S\(X 1 P Sort if | S\(X 1 P  S\(E\(L\(k-1\\| /| S\(E\(L\(k-1\\| > C min then To determine whether S\(X 1 P E\(L\(k-1\ the rule R = R U{ S\(X 1 P S\(E\(L\(k-1 Sort\(R, S\(X 1 P S\(E\(L\(k-1\\\\//sorted Next Next  Output rules R 4  E XAMPLE  In my research of the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine by data mining, to determine the TCM symptom diagnostic criteria and Efficacy Evaluation Index

Also, we make comparisons with the distance based co-location patterns A The inclusion character Obviously, the qualitative spatial co-location pattern set is a subset of traditional k nearest features based co-location pattern set when chosen the same support threshold, which means there has an inclusive relation between these two kinds of pattern. If Qu-Co-location k C p a i  C q a j ists, then Colocation k C p  C q oo This character can be used to find qualitative spatial colocation patterns according to the traditional k nearest features based co-location patterns B The anti-symmetry character Distance based co-location pattern s are bidirectional and symmetrical, co-location\(A, B  co-location\(B, A However, the computation of these patterns is very effected by the instance number of A an d B, especially to those rare spatial features. Itês nearly impossi ble to get a distance based co-location pattern contains rare spatial features. Huang identify a weak monotonic property of the maximal participation ratio to mine patterns contain rare spatial feature We notice that the computation complexity well be increasing exponentially as the th reshold low down. It is equal to the Apriori algorithm without pruni ng step, when chosen 0 as the support threshold According to our definition 4 k nearest features based colocation patterns have already considered the fact that each feature type has different in stance number. Usually, colocation k A, B  co-location k B, A\We call it anti-symmetry character. This character can handle the rare spatial feature situation, example 6 shows that feature type D only has two instances, although Supp ort\(C, D\1/3 \(2-NF\(C 4 d 2NF\(C 5 tain Dês instance\t Co-location 2 D  C with Support\(D C\Specifically, if colocation k C a  C b d Co-location k C b  C a both exist, then co-location k C a  C b  Example 7 From the 7 results of exam ple 6, as both Colocation 2 A  B\nd Co-location 2 B  A\ are exist, we can get a bidirectional k nearest features based co-location pattern Co-location 2 A  B 2 A  C\Two co-location patternsê support values are 80% and 60 V T HE Q U C OM ALGORITHM To mining qualitative spatial co location patterns directly is costly. For a spatial dataset which contains seven spatial feature types, each feature type contains only one classified non-spatial attributes and each non-spatial attribute has four kinds of qualitative de scription, when set k equals to 5, the size of each feature objectês k NF set could be calculated as below 12345 77 77 7 4 4 4 4 4 3306 8 size C C C C C 015\015\015\015 This could be very in efficient for a large spatial datasets even when facing multiple non-spatial attributes situation As mentioned in section IV, we can use the results of traditional k nearest features based co-location patterns, to mining qualitative spatial co-location patterns from them. This can avoid many computations, the size of k-NF set is diminished sharply \(only those spatial feature types have colocation relations will be used to establish the k-NF set\and also the length of each candidate frequent itemset will be shorter than k. Following this idea, we developed our QuCOM Qualitative spatial CO-location pa tterns Mining A QuCOM algori thm description The QuCOM algorithm can be di vided into two parts K nearest features based co-location patterns generation Qualitative spatial co-location pa tterns generation. Actually the first part could be a ordinary k nearest features based spatial co-location patterns mining algorithm like KNFCOM just focus on the second part here The key point in gene ration qualitative spatial Co-location patterns is to calculate Qualitative support for each k nearest feature types which are generated in \(1\first and foremost introduced data st ructure is AttrSet, it is used to store all the candidate qualitative spatial co-location patterns and their suppo rt values. For each spatial feature type, set the size of th is hashtable arraylise equals to the total number of its classified attributes, and each Hashtable contains the combination of other feature typesê classified attributes which have k nearest features based co-location relation with it Other three ma jor data structures are ArrayList<PatternsSet Hashtable St ring Integer and Hashtable   First one is used to store all k nearest features based colocation patterns, its size is M The seco nd one is used to store all feature typesê classified attributes values and their total numbers, for the following su pport calculations The last one

In this paper, we proposed a new spatial association pattern: qu alitative spatial co-location pattern. To mining this pa ttern from spatial datasets, we gave several definitions, and pro posed the QuCOM algorithm Comparison analysis in th e experiments part gave a clear proof that the qualitative spatial co-location mining can get more interesting results than traditional ones The ability to handle lin er spatial features is still a challenge in the spatial association rules mining area, because the definition of its close relationship is more difficult than points and polygons. Also, the QuCOM algorithm only can handle point and polygon spatial features well. Extending it to handle all kinds of spatial features could be our ongoing work A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This study was funded by a grant \(Project Number 41001231\ Nationa l Natural Science Foundation of China, and the National High Technology Research and Development Program \("863"Program\na Project Number: 2011aa120304 R EFERENCES  S.

We assumed a horizontally partitioned dataset and a message passing communication model. We considered a single class as a consequence but the algorithm can be easily applied for rules with a pattern as the consequence We theoretically proofed a relation between locally large and globally large patterns that is used for local pruning at each site to reduce the searched candidates.  We derived a locally large threshold using a globally set minimum recall threshold Local pruning achieves a reduction in the number of searched candidates and this reduction has a proportional impact on the reduction of exchanged messages. The performance study has demonstrated that EDP-ORD generates a much smaller set of candidate sets and requires significantly smaller amount of messages when compared to a naÔve extension NDP-ORD This shows that EDP-ORD is a scalable distributed efficient and effective technique for ORD in large databases We implemented only local pruning, however we discussed an upper-bound pruning that can help in achieving further reduction. Future extensions include studying upper-bound and polling-site pruning [9  an d  ex t e n d in g th e a l g o r ith m in  ca s e o f  vertically partitioned data set.

ing work because the approach is free from any assumptions on the structure of the attribute and does not have to rely on statistical approximations We evaluate the approach using two synthetic data sets to establish the upper and lower bounds of the covered similarity space We nd that we can cover the whole similarity space and that we are only constrained by the random number generation To validate the method against this constraint we investigate the speciìc inîuence of the random number generation by using the method as a test of randomness Additionally operational systems usually exhibit large amounts of noise in their workload therefore we validate the method against noise as well Our ndings show that it is highly resistant to noise whereas other commonly employed methods yield to the law of large numbers or fail completely Additionally the method can consistently identify dissimilar behaviour as well even though it is not as good at that task which is only partially true for other commonly employed methods The second method uses association rule analysis to identify and quantify the relationship between descriptive attributes of the workload The novel idea of this approach is to eliminate the use of values and instead focus on the attributes themselves and therefore rank the relative usage of the attribute That way the most important building blocks of the workload can be compared directly The algorithm is described and then evaluated using synthetic data sets to establish the upper and lower bounds of the covered similarity space This time we nd that we are only constrained by the amount of learnt rules which follows from the used rule learning algorithm At least 16 rules need to be available to cover the whole similarity space when the apriori algorithm is used The method itself however does not require a speciìc rule learning algorithm We then present our compound measure that can address problematic workload characteristics We use the transfer function concept to weight speciìc events in the waveletmethod based on relative attribute dependencies Then we conduct an empirical study to evaluate all methods on operational workload from seven large-scale distributed systems Two important characteristics stand out First the time and frequency behaviour is surprisingly well-modelled with a wavelet method Second the association rule by itself is seemingly useless However the inclusion of descriptive attributes improves accuracy when determining similarity of workloads We show that the compound measure improves upon existing work by evaluating it against two important scheduling metrics mean waiting time and mean execution time The analysis of descriptive attributes for the similarity in addition to the analysis of the time-dependent attribute yields a compound similarity measure that can improve accuracy by 24.5 At the same time the standard deviation can be reduced by 10.4 We conìrm these results with an independent statistical hypothesis test a twosample Anderson-Darling statistic and show the advantage of the compound measure even at higher signiìcance levels of  0  125 with only 11 dierence Our results strongly reassure our initial expectations that the compound measure is a good choice for large-scale and data-intensive systems that have to deal with enormous amounts of events and previously unknown dependencies in their workload Furthermore even though we only used scientiìc workloads in our evaluations we did not observe any constraint that would limit the use to scientiìc workloads 7 FUTURE WORK As a result of this work we can continue to evolve our simulation eort for DQ2 We will use the similarity measure to evaluate the results of our future workload models to speciìcally address problems like data transfer cycles distributed le caching or popularity-based deletion However the measure can still be improved If it is suspected that dependencies change over time then the rate of change needs to be investigated Extending the association rule measure with time-evolving graphs may prove to be appropriate for such cases Additionally we only used the Haar wavelet as suggested by previous work We are interested in investigating the inîuence of dierent types of wavelets on the analysis of non-periodic burst behaviour An implementation of the similarity measure including already pre-processed versions of the used workloads from the evaluation can be downloaded from our website  8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful to the following teams for providing

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
