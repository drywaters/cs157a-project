Abstract\227 Accurate object tracking has become increasingly important with developments in Lidar and high-resolution camera systems for remote surveillance Typical methods utilize Markov Chain state estimation paired with Kalman or particle 002lters These methods however are susceptible to loss of track if an error is encountered or a loss of image occurs We developed a set of algorithms built on more recent efforts that have been aimed at reconstructing the three-dimensional trajectory of the object These methods typically require a priori information about the target being tracked when using a single camera We attempt to accomplish trajectory reconstruction without information about the system beyond a known camera matrix Using feature locations extracted from a series of images combined with the associated camera matrices we generate a linear system of equations relating the image coordinates in two-dimensional projective space to the real-world three-dimensional coordinates We use this system of equations to generate a least-squares polynomial 002t for the data The resulting system of equations successfully recovers polynomial equations of motion and outperforms Taylor approximations of equal degree outside of the convergent region Introducing translational errors causes the error-minimizing angle combination to differ from the single most likely analytic angle combination We employ a meanapproximating method to generate an adjusted angular value and demonstrate this represents an improvement in accuracy over the analytic solution T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1 I

gimbal-mounted camera system in real time by predicting the objects location at future times based on an estimation of the targets trajectory The gimbaled system is commonly used in such 002elds as surveillance and projectile tracking but typically relies on control systems to  978-1-4799-1622-1/14 31  00 c 015 2014 IEEE 1 IEEEAC Paper xxxx Version x Updated dd/mm/yyyy update positional information in order to maintain track on an object 050as in 5]\051 these systems ho we v er  are inher ently reactive rather than proactive and susceptible to loss of track resulting from missing information As noted in tracking methods that use methods similar to a Markov chain are highly susceptible to tracking loss following a failure because the failure is propagated to future time A trajectory estimation-based method provides a more robust alternative allowing the system to predict and move to future positions in anticipation of the targets motion rather than in response to it The current problem can be divided into two sub-problems 002rst the generation of the estimated trajectory second the usage of that information to update the orientation of the gimbal system The setup considered for this application consists of in addition to the gimbal-mounted camera two sources of input a global positioning system 050GPS\051 to relay positional information about the gimbal system and an inertial measurement unit 050IMU\051 to provide angular information These components are necessary to accurately identify the cameras position and attitude in space important parameters in both of the subproblems described The 002rst portion of the paper will focus on trajectory estimation by a single gimbal-mounted camera Locating an object in space with two calibrated cameras operating in tandem is easily accomplished but deriving a solution with a single camera has the advantage of being mechanically simpler and cheaper The reconstruction of trajectories from a series of camera images has been well-studied over the last decade beginning with the introduction of the concept of trajectory triangulation by Avidan and Shashua in 2000 In this and succeeding work however there exists a requirement for constraints on the motion of the object or a priori knowledge of the system that may be unavailable in the general case To achieve truly general trajectory estimation it is necessary to remove this requirement of prior knowledge and solve the system with as few constraints as possible The primary objective of the 002rst part of this paper is to lay out a system for accomplishing this as well as noting the current shortcomings with the method employed Additionally moving away from perfect 050i.e error-free\051 data presents challenges in reconstructing the trajectory which are also considered With a trajectory estimation in hand it is possible to proactively move the gimbaled camera to a new position to maintain track on a target The analytic solution given known positional information about the target and the camera is described in b ut the problem increases in comple xity with the introduction of latent response and translational error For a gimbal positioning displaced from the 0 016 mark the angle subtended by an equal displacement in the positive 1 


or negative direction in each of the ordinate directions may not be equal as a result the most likely angular position of the object in space may differ from the analytic value in some cases The second portion of this paper attempts to frame this issue and discuss solution methods to move to the most accurate possible position in the shortest possible time Simulations of data are provided to validate the models presented 2 R ELATED W ORK As noted previously the 002rst description of a method for recovering a trajectory from a series of images was put forth in where the problem w as solv ed for linear and conic trajectories For linear trajectories the trajectory is linearly recovered whereas the treatment for general conics was non-linear the general case was later linearized in While in both cases results were obtained that validated the methodology employed the solutions possess several features that make them ill-suited for application in real-time geo registration First the linearized solution obtained describes the parameterized shape of the trajectory but does not yield an explicit time function for the position As a result the derived trajectory can be used to determine the position of the object in each image by determining the intersection between the line-of-sight vector and the curve but it does not have the predictive capability to estimate positions at future times based on the current time This was originally done in to discard any assumptions about the motion of the object but given enough samples we may make reasonable assumptions about the motion in between the samples if we calculate the distance traveled across equal time samples is also equal over a large number of samples it is reasonable to conclude that the object is moving at a constant velocity Additionally by only solving for the intersecting curve the methods proposed in and 9 are unable to resolv e systems where multiple curves may intersect the same set of lines The addition of a temporal element in this work helps to resolve this situation and generate a unique solution Additionally the linearization of general conics described in relies on generating a solution to the Chow polynomial which cannot be done without an additional estimated constraint A different approach was adopted in and 11 which make use of a known quality of the motion 050in this case projectile\051 to add a constraint to the system namely that its motion in the vertical direction was affected by a gravitational force equal to 000 gt 2  2  The methods employed in were extended in to at tempt to successfully catch a projectile based on the predictive trajectory model Similarly in integration of a motion equation was carried out considering a de\002ned drag force component and it is noted in that Keplerian motion dynamics are used in a similar manner for orbit reconstruction In the general case however there is no way to know with certainty which dynamics can be applied to the system the forces acting on an object may exceed simple Newtonian forces and may be incalculable One such example would be any sort of object experiencing an applied thrust which would not be easily derivable without prior knowledge of the object and would alter the expected effects of forces such as gravity and drag The chief advantage of these representations however is that they are effective predictors 050an especially necessary requirement for the robot ball-catching applications described in and 13]\051 The method for trajectory estimation proposed in this paper aims to achieve the generality of the shape-\002tting curve estimation with the predictive capabilities of the dynamicsconstrained methods The primary difference between this work and the previous work is that although the curve is parameterized as in and 9 it is based on true times thereby reconstructing an equation of motion for the object For example a cubic model can be seen as estimating the initial position velocity acceleration and jerk for the object which can suf\002ciently describe many typical motions 3 T RAJECTORY E STIMATION Background Assumptions and Equations In order to locate the object in space the camera matrix must be known at each time instance as such calibrated cameras must be used The camera matrix 050 M 051 is the product of three separate matrices a matrix for the intrinsic properties of the camera 050 In 051 the projection matrix 050 P 051 and a matrix representing the extrinsic properties of the camera 050 E 051 As such it can be written as M  InPE 0501\051 The matrices are de\002ned as follows Projection Matrix\227 The projection matrix facilitates the conversion from 3-dimensional coordinate space to twodimensional coordinate space and is dependent on the axis setup used for the coordinate system used the x-axis was the camera axis and the resulting projection matrix was given by  0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 000 1 f 0 0 0  0502\051 Where f is the focal length Intrinsic Matrix\227 The intrinsic matrix is de\002ned based on the speci\002cations of the camera being used these can be acquired through calibration of the camera or may be provided by the cameras manufacturer The relevant parameters are the scaling factor in each direction and the focal length as well as the principal point of the image plane  f k y 1 0 y 1  0 0 f k y 2 y 2  0 0 0 1  0503\051 Where k y represents the scaling factor in each direction and y i 0 is the coordinate of the principal point in the i th dimension Extrinsic Matrix\227 While the projection matrix and intrinsic matrix are constant with time the extrinsic matrix is a function of the rotational and translational position of the camera in space These values are derived from the time-stamped GPS and IMU input information The extrinsic matrix is given by 024 R T 1 0 025 0504\051 Where R is the rotation matrix and T is the translation vector Image Equations\227 The pixel location registered by the camera is a function of the targets true position in threedimensional space and the camera matrix  y  030  M  x  0505\051 2 


Where y is written in the projective coordinates  y 1 y 2 1  0506\051 and represents the coordinates of the image pixel while x is the target position vector in projective coordinates  x 1 x 2 x 3 1  0507\051 This is accurate up to a scale factor the image coordinates may be written as y 1  m 1 x  m 3 x 0508\051 and y 2  m 2 x  m 3 x 0509\051 Where m i represents the i th row of the camera matrix M  Linear System Construction and Solution Each sample contributes two linear equations to the system of equations that must be solved to generate a best-\002t trajectory estimation The motion of the object in space is parameterized by time so that the position vector  x    x 1 050 t 051 x 2 050 t 051 x 3 050 t 051 1  T  The goal for each direction of motion is to reconstruct the low-degree Taylor polynomial describing its motion for example x 1 050 t 051  a 0  a 1 t  a 2 t 2      a n t n  This can be seen as an extension of the work carried out in e xcept here we make no assumptions about the values of any coef\002cients and instead attempt to solve for the coef\002cients Rewriting equations 0508\051 and 0509\051 yields two linear equations with respect to the position vector x 050 t 051  For a given degree approximation substituting such an expression into the system of equations and rearranging allows for the variable terms to be separated from the known constant terms which in turn allows the coef\002cients for the approximation to be pulled out and represented as a column vector recovering the familiar form G a   b  where a is the coef\002cient matrix and G is typically rectangular yielding a least-squares solution for a  For example in the linear 002t the 002rst two lines of the matrix G would look like 024 050 m 11 000 y 1 m 31 051 050 m 12 000 y 1 m 32 051 050 m 13 000 y 1 m 33 051 050 m 21 000 y 2 m 31 051 050 m 22 000 y 2 m 33 051 050 m 23 000 y 2 m 33 051  050 m 11 000 y 1 m 31 051 t 1 050 m 12 000 y 1 m 32 051 t 1 050 m 13 000 y 1 m 33 051 t 1 050 m 21 000 y 2 m 31 051 t 1 050 m 22 000 y 2 m 32 051 t 1 050 m 23 000 y 2 m 33 051 t 1 025 05010\051 While the coef\002cient vector a would be given by  a 01 a 02 a 03 a 11 a 12 a 13  T 05011\051 Where a ij represents the coef\002cient on t i for the polynomial representing x j 050 t 051  Linear Independence of the System of Equations\227 A full formal proof will not be provided here to demonstrate the linear independence of the equations in the system of equations however a brief overview will be given The independence will be demonstrated in two parts 002rst it will be noted that the two equations generated from each image are linearly independent second it will be shown that each set of equations is independent provided certain conditions are met We 002rst note that in a physical sense the two image coordinates for the object in each frame are independent of one another knowing one provides no information about the value of the other As a result any instances of mathematical dependence are only a numerical coincidence not a physical property of the system Such values will exist along at least one span the relevant matrices are de\002ned by four variables 050the pitch and yaw of the base and the elevation and azimuthal angles of the gimbal system\051 and the solution is garnered from only three equations as follows For simplicity we will use letters to represent spaces in the rotation matrices of which the system is composed Each matrix is dependent on only one angular variable so the two letters in each matrix can be related by a trigonometric identity The matrices are P itch   A 0 B 0 1 0 000 B 0 A  Elevation   E 0 F 0 1 0 000 F 0 E  Y aw   C 000 D 0 D C 0 0 0 1  Azimuth   G 000 H 0 H G 0 0 0 1  Since the time for the two images within each sample is the same the necessary relation is given by m 1  1:3 000 y 1 m 3  1:3  n 050 m 2  1:3 000 y 2 m 3  1:3 051 05012\051 With n an arbitrary constant Since each equation yields a 1x3 row for the system of linear equations this relationship yields three separate equations m 1 i 000 y 1 m 3 i  n 050 m 2 i 000 y 2 m 3 i 051 05013\051 For the two equations to be dependent the resulting system of equations must have a solution for n  For the system to be dependent for all values of the four angular inputs each equation would need to result in a tautology 050such as AC 000 DE  AC 000 DE 051 This however is not the case but because there are more variables 050four\051 than equations 050three\051 there exists a 4-coordinate vector along which one equation will be a constant times the other for a given image coordinate pair 050 y 1  y 2 051  As a result it is in the general case acceptable to consider the two equations derived from each image sample to be linearly independent Independence of Samples\227 The speci\002c motions of the base and the object determine how many independent equations can be obtained from each camera view This is thoroughly described in the conclusions yielded from the analysis in that paper however do not hold precisely for the methods described here because of the additional constraint provided by a time requirement Consider 002rst the case of a static camera regardless of the number of samples obtained there is always an in\002nite solution set for the answer because in the provided formulation the number of constraints a static camera can provide is always exceeded by the number of constraints required to accurately de\002ne the system Combined with the line-of-sight vector one dimension of positional information is suf\002cient to calculate the other two coordinates 050as they will correspond to the intersection of the line-of-sight vector and the plane de\002ned by the known coordinate\051 Although in the static camera case there are in\002nite solutions for each 3 


Figure 1  Simulation of an object in motion The image pixel is a function of the line connecting the camera center to the target point As the object 050green circle\051 moves and the camera rotates the point where this line intersects the image plane 050transparent rectangle\051 changes This is combined with the known angular information to derive the objects trajectory point along the line-of-sight vector a unique solution exists so knowing the initial position allows for the recovery of the solution corresponding to the initial position coordinates In practice there are numerous classes of problems where an aspect of the ground-truth for the initial position may be known Several of these classes are considered Soccer Ball Positioning\227 Much research has been done on ef\002cient methods for reconstructing object trajectories as they relate to sports broadcasts This is widely used for the purposes of analysis One popular aspect of this analysis is the tracking of a soccer ball as it is passed or kicked In triangular relations between the balls height and the height of players on the 002eld are used to estimate the height of the ball at a given time and thereby reconstruct the trajectory In cases where the ball does not land on the ground physicsbased principles describing the motion of the ball are used to resolve the system namely the constraint of parabolic motion through the air The motion of a soccer ball however may not be simply represented by simple parabolic projectile motion spin will often be applied to balls on shots or passes that cause the ball to follow a curving trajectory through the air not easily captured by the triangle-based system described The system proposed in this paper can more readily handle such motions provided the initial position by virtue of the setting of the 002eld at z  0 050this is similarly noted in and 16]\051 In the case where the camera matrix is not known ahead of time 050as is likely if using a broadcast feed for analysis\051 the method outlined in can be used to calibrate the camera at which point the trajectory may be recovered using the system of linear equations Car on a Road\227 Accurately modeling the trajectories of moving vehicles on a roadway has potential applications both in traf\002c pattern analysis and surveillance Similarly to the case of the soccer ball the road can be used as a convenient reference point and set to z  0  allowing the position of a vehicle to be determined at the initial time From there the trajectory can be simply recovered This has the advantage of being realizable in real-time unlike methods such as the one proposed in which mak es use of a Monte Carlo simulation and is incapable of on-line processing Additionally the Monte Carlo simulation is constrained based on estimates of certain parameters affecting the motion of the vehicle such as the rate at which the wheel can be turned trajectory modeling can be accomplished with the proposed method without the potentially dif\002cult task of de\002ning a reasonable search space as would be necessary for any form of Monte Carlo simulation Error-based Challenges The overconstrained system used to solve for the relevant coef\002cients yields a least-squares solution for the coef\002cients and initial position vectors There are multiple sources of error that can reduce the accuracy of the results however and their effects on the outcome in the general case are distinct Primary sources of error are translational error in the positioning of the target 050deviations from a perfect polynomial trajectory\051 or the base 050GPS input error bounds\051 and pixel error in the camera 050discrepancies between the measured pixel location and the expectation value of the pixel location\051 Similar error considerations are made in b ut are considered with respect to extended and unscented Kalman 002lters and are represented by higher-order perturbation terms here the goal is to accurately model the expectation value of the predicted motion assuming random noise so a strong model should disregard higher-order perturbation terms and instead return the base trajectory polynomial Translational Error\227 Translational errors represent deviations in the position of the target object in space from its overall trajectory path As such they can be modeled by adding an error term to the position vector such that x 050 t 051 0  x 050 t 051   050 t 051  Substituting into the rearranged forms of 0508\051 and 0509\051 the equations can now be written as y i m 3 050 x 050 t 051   050 t 051\051  m i 050 x 050 t 051   050 t 051\051 05014\051 These deviations can potentially yield values for the image coordinates that differ from what would be predicted by the general trajectory as such they reduce the accuracy of the 4 


Figure 2  Illustration of translational error on angular probability distribution Here a normal Gaussian function is used to describe the error in one direction Equal displacements in different directions subtend different angles as can be seen in 050a\051 which leads to a shifted Gaussian function for the angular distribution 050b\051 least-squares 002t solution As these errors approach zero the exact trajectory can be recovered successfully as expected 050because x 050 t 051 0  x 050 t 051 051 Additionally the effects of errors are more signi\002cant at small sample sizes where small deviations have a greater sway on the mean and median Translational error can be overcome by observing suf\002cient samples to generate a more precise window for the targets general path The recovery of an accurate solution at large values is made possible by the fact that the equation now solves for the leastsquares solution to x 050 t 051 0 instead of x 050 t 051  which can be thought of as the linear combination of the solutions for x 050 t 051 and  050 t 051  It  050 t 051 is normally distributed the least-squares solution will be  0 at large sample sizes returning the least-squares solution for x 050 t 051 as the correct answer Pixel Error\227 Unlike translational errors pixel errors propagate as errors in the model rather than simply error in the 002nal assessment The reason for this can be seen by reconsidering the equation for an image coordinate as a function of the objects position in space In the error-free case this is given by 0502\051 and 0503\051 and when rearranged is used to 002nd the least-squares solution for the coef\002cient vector However a stochastic error addition can be written as y i  m i x  m 3 x   05015\051 Adopting the same form as in 05014\051 the equation being solved is now 050 y i 000 023 o 051 m 3 x 050 t 051  m i x 050 t 051 05016\051 Assuming a normal error distribution the expectation value of this error becomes 0 at large sample sizes and the model will converge toward the correct polynomial solution at large times In both the pixel and translational cases the key point of interest is not whether the correct solution can still be attained but how long is required to do so an error-free solution can be found for a cubic function for example with only 5 samples but errors in such a small sample size can have a signi\002cant effect on the overall accuracy of the system 4 P OSTION U PDATING Error-Free Case In the case where error and latency are not considered the gimbal angles can be found by calculating the unit vector representing the line between the base and the target then using that information to recover the gimbal angles from the rotation matrix Based on the orientation that the positive xaxis coincides with the camera axis when the azimuth and elevation angles are both 0 016  the orientation of the gimbals camera axis in terms of the azimuth angle 036 and elevation angle 022 is given by  t  cos  cos 022 sin  cos 022 000 sin 022  T 05017\051 Recognizing 036 can vary between 000 031 and 031 and 022 can vary between 000 031 2 and 031 2  there are three values that are calculated We have a linear system of equations this time with an exact solution rather than a least-squares solution R  t   x 05018\051 Here R is the rotation matrix determined by the base angles and  x is the unit vector in the direction of the line of sight vector between the base and the target This yields a unique solution for  t  which can then be solved using inverse sine and cosine functions to recover the values of 022 and 036  Another version of the closed-form solution and the relevant rotation matrix are given in Effects of Translational Error Translational error in the target or bases position can affect the most likely gimbal angles in each direction To achieve higher accuracy 050as may be necessary in noisy environments or high-accuracy applications\051 the gimbal angles of interest are the peak likelihood error values when the error on the system is considered For a multivariate Gaussian probability distribution the likelihood of a given displacement from the true position is given by W 050 x 051  1  0502 031 051 3  2 j 006 j 1  2 exp 022 000 1  2 000 001 x T 006 000 1 001 x 001 023 05019\051 Where 006 is the covariance matrix This function is in terms of the Cartesian coordinate system so we must rewrite the function in terms of the elevation and azimuth angles the error vector 001 x can be rewritten as 001 x  a R  cos  0 cos 022 0 sin  0 cos 022 0 sin 022 0  000  x 1 x 2 x 3  05020\051 Where 036 0 is the azimuth angle corresponding to the error displacement and 022 0 is the elevation angle corresponding to the error displacement R is the rotation matrix determined by the base angles and is an arbitrary scaling constant 5 


Figure 3  Relationship between distribution function and error function argument The weight function for a range of values of 050a\051 is compared to the argument of its error function 050b\051 demonstrating the maximum of the argument corresponds to the peak value of the weight function Substituting 05020\051 into 05019\051 yields a distribution function in terms of 036 0 and 022 0  W 050 a  0  022 0 051  1  0502 031 051 3  2 j 006 j 1  2 exp 000 000 C 1 050  0  022 0 051 a 2 000 C 2 050  0  022 0 051 a 000 C 3 001 05021\051 With C 1 and C 2 functions of the error angles while C 3 is a constant 050all three are derived from the values of the original expression\051 This can be integrated over the range of all a  0 to 1  Note that a cannot be negative as this would correspond to a different gimbal angle combination we are only interested in positive rays leading out from the bases position This integration yields the distribution function as a function only of the azimuth and elevation angles W 000  0  022 0 001  p  031 exp 020 000 C 3  C 2 2  4 C 1 021  2 p  C 1 022 1  erf 022 C 2  2 C 1 023\023 05022\051 As can be seen in Fig 3 the transformation to representation in terms of the azimuth and elevation angles can cause the resulting function to be asymmetric about the peak In all cases this peak corresponds to the analytic solution the asymmetry however implies that the optimal positioning of the camera may differ from the positioning expected in the analytic case Here the optimal positioning is considered to be the positioning that minimizes the least-squares error associated with random noise on the system as such the error may be reduced by moving toward the mean of the distribution 050which will differ from the peak in the presence of skew\051 Because of the complexity of the integral required to convert the positioning function to a single variable 050and the lack of generality therein\051 and the impossibility of doing a Monte Carlo-like simulation in real-time it is impractical to attempt to calculate the true mean for real-time applications in practice however an improved estimate can be obtained by computing a Riemann sum over a subset of the range To limit the dimensionality of the problem we note that the most signi\002cant curve 050the widest and tallest one\051 corresponds to the analytic solutions in each direction As a result these curves will have the largest impact on the mean of the entire distribution function To compute the approximate mean value for the azimuth angle 036  the elevation angle 022 is held constant and the azimuth angle is incremented away from the analytic solution in each direction The expectation value of this angle is calculated using a Riemann sum furthermore it is unnecessary to search over the entire range of 0 to 2 031 because the function rapidly goes to zero The mean value is therefore given by 026   k\016 P n  000 k\016 050    n 051 W 020    n  022 021 016  k\016 P n  000 k\016 W 020    n  022 021 016 05023\051 Where 026  is the calculated mean position   and  022 are the analytic values for the azimuth and elevation angles respectively and 016 is an arbitrary interval between samplings The value of k is also arbitrary and only needs to be large enough to determine the mean estimation within tolerance for this reason in application the mean is determined building out from k  0 050the analytic solution\051 until the calculation for the mean asymptotes 5 S IMULATIONS AND R ESULTS Simulations were carried out in MATLAB to assess the validity of the solution Inputs provided for MATLAB were time gimbal angles base angles and base and target positions The tests verifying trajectory estimation and position updating error adjustment will be separately considered Trajectory Estimation in Ideal Case Two parameters are of interest in determining the validity of the trajectory estimation method 002rst whether the estimation is able to discriminate between different degree polynomial representations 050if it identi\002es a cubic function for a cubic a quadratic for a quadratic etc.\051 second whether for the correct degree it selects the correct polynomial to represent the motion The 002rst case was accomplished by assigning a cost function associated with the distance between the estimated pixel values at a given time and the measured pixel values at that time 050see Fig 4\051 A range of times was then iterated 6 


Figure 4  Discrimination between different degree 002ts Linear quadratic and cubic trajectories were generated for a motion of degree 3 at each of the sample times the accuracy of the estimate was determined by employing a cost function comparing the errors in the predicted image coordinates The test used error-free data but employed the minimum condition for a unique solution i.e no translational motion by the base and only angular movement by the gimbal not the base 050top\051 At larger sample sizes the accuracy of the linear and quadratic models diminishes re\003ecting the improvement in discrimination with increasing sample size The introduction of variance to the base angle or translational motion further improves discrimination between test degree 002ts 050bottom\051 through to test a cubic-order trajectory The test trajectory was a straight line meaning its parameterization could have been accomplished by a similar linear or quadratic trajectory This was done to provide the most likely case where a false positive might be returned at a lower trajectory The second case used two different tests to validate the claims In the 002rst for the correct degree 002t a range of guessed vectors were iterated through and the cost function calculated If the 002t is correct the peak of this cost function should reside at the correct magnitude for the guessed vector and should be unique 050shown in Fig 5\051 Second for an increasing sample size the true and estimated positions were calculated using the algorithm and the magnitude of the difference in position between the estimated and the true trajectories at the end time was calculated 050Fig 6\051 Figure 5  Existence of a unique solution Within the correct degree search there is a de\002ned peak 002t point con\002rming the existence of a unique solution for the given input This curve was based on a cubic function that was also used for the data in Fig 4 The scalar applied to the guessed vector is labeled on the x-axis Figure 6  Accuracy of trajectory model The magnitude of the distance between the estimated position and the true position was 002rst calculated 050red\051 The magnitude of the vector between the origin and the true position coordinates is shown in 050green\051 while the fraction of this magnitude represented by the distance error is represented in blue Times from 5 to 100 are plotted in all three cases and the data was based on 6 time samples between t  0 and t  5  Note that although the estimate gets less accurate in an absolute sense at large times the percent error from the true value decreases with time 050and is at all times low\051 demonstrating the robustness of the algorithm 7

Figure 8  Monte Carlo simulation results for position updating 10,000 random base angle combinations were calculated and used with each combination sampled 10,000 times with a known error distribution 050which was diagonal but not isotropic\051 The results show that the approximate mean estimate outperformed the analytic solution for almost all angular combinations Left an overhead view showing the pitch angle on the x-axis and the yaw angle on the y-axis Right the same plot viewed with the yaw angle on the x-axis and the rms error difference on the y-axis 050a positive difference corresponds to an improvement by the approximate mean estimation\051 mial estimation can be divided into two categories modeling in the region where the 002nite Taylor series converges and modeling in the region where the Taylor series does not converge In the convergent region the best-\002t polynomial of a given degree should closely match the Taylor series outside of this region the data may be better 002t by a polynomial function that is less accurate than the Taylor series in the convergent region of estimation but more accurate than the Taylor series outside of the convergent region Tests were run at three times with trajectory estimations used to project both forward and backward and the models were compared to the true trajectory and the corresponding-degree Taylor approximation The motions provided here are the motions in the x-direction the corresponding trajectory function is provided Oscillation\227 The periodic function used was x 050 t 051  sin 050  1 t 051  4  Trajectories were calculated at t  5  t  20  and t  50  then extrapolated out to t  100  The results for the linear quadratic and cubic 002ts are provided in Fig 9 Viscous Flow\227 The exponential decay function used was x 050 t 051  e 000  01 t  4  As in the oscillation example trajectories were calculated at the time intervals t  5  t  20  and t  50  The results are summarized in Fig 10 Drag\227 The logarithmic function used was x 050 t 051  log 050  025 t  1\051  4  The trajectories were calculated at the same intervals as in the previous cases The results are provided in Fig 11 In all three special types of motion considered the leastsquares trajectory calculated by the estimation method performs as well as or better than the corresponding-degree Taylor approximation This is especially notable and important in the logarithmic case where the radius of convergence is only up to a value of 1 for the function used this would correspond to convergence up to t  40  as can be seen in the plots In contrast the cubic approximation for the log function demonstrates increasing accuracy at large sample sizes closely approximating the curve up to t  80 in the estimation at t  50  6 C ONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated an effective alternative to current trajectory estimation strategies such as Markov chain models and other forms of trajectory reconstruction The method proposed can be achieved in real-time and can effectively operate with less responsive hardware than other tracking methods because of its predictive capabilities In addition this was accomplished with a minimal amount of a priori information using only a known calibrated camera this is a general prerequisite on most trajectory reconstruction strategies and is generally attainable for a system prior to usage The system has also demonstrated linearity in the number of samples required based on unknown parameters a trajectory of degree n requires 3\050 n  1\051 independent equations and as long as the requirements for independence are met trajectories have successfully been recovered at the point where 3\050 n  1\051 024 2 k  where k is the number of images utilized At a frame rate of 30 frames per second this theoretically allows the construction of a 19 th degree polynomial in the 002rst second of measurements For most applications such a high degree estimation may be both impractical and unnecessary but these higher order terms may be useful in the calculation of types of motion not normally well-described by low-degree polynomials Additionally because non-polynomial motions tend to converge better closer to the initial point and diverge 9 


Figure 9  Estimation of sinusoidal trajectory at three sample times The trajectory was estimated by a linear function a quadratic function and a cubic function with three different maximum times 0505 20 and 50\051 As can be seen in all three cases the accuracy improves with the increased sample size and outperform the Taylor approximation The approximations do not predict future times well all three are primarily accurate in the region of measurement Figure 10  Estimation of exponential trajectory at three sample times The trajectory was estimated by a linear function a quadratic function and a cubic function with three different maximum times 0505 20 and 50\051 as with the sinusoidal trajectory In the region observed here the quadratic and cubic functions both demonstrate high levels of accuracy and improvement over the Taylor approximation ultimately however the predictive ability of the polynomial approximation is limited by the end behavior of an exponential decay function compared to that of a polynomial 10 


Figure 11  Estimation of sinusoidal trajectory at three sample times The trajectory was again estimated by a linear function a quadratic function and a cubic function with three different maximum times 0505 20 and 50\051 Here the polynomial estimation shows a marked improvement over the Taylor approximation The results for the estimated polynomial when compared to the Taylor approximation differ in two important ways 002rst all Taylor polynomials are only able to converge over a 002nite range 050 000 1  x 024 1 for the parent function\051 while no such restriction is observed for the polynomial estimation second higher-order Taylor approximations perform worse than lower-order approximations past a certain point behavior that is also not observed here at larger times more accurate results may be attainable by resampling at a later time rather than simply adding terms to the estimation This is exempli\002ed by the cubic estimation of the sinusoidal trajectory above a cubic trajectory can only change directions two times and goes to positive and negative in\002nity at its endpoints as a result there is an inherent limit on its ability to model an oscillatory function which changes directions an in\002nite number of times and remains within a speci\002ed range If each sample is simply added to a stack eventually the accuracy of the estimation will degrade however if only the most recent n samples are used the trajectory utilized can continuously update to re\003ect the current state of the function If the sample size is suf\002ciently large compared to the rate of oscillation this will yield strong convergence at all times and still maintain predictive value albeit only for a truncated time in the future 050the time of one period\051 Additionally for polynomial 002ts the system correctly discriminates between incorrect lower-degree trajectories and the true trajectory This supports a build up strategy for determining the best 002t for a data set starting with lowerdegree trajectory estimations and increasing the tested degree until a threshold value is attained for the cost function 050that is a point at which the system accepts a trajectory as a good 002t\051 Additionally the trajectory estimation can be combined with more traditional methods to improve robustness and compensate for situations where a polynomial representation of the motion may not be available or useful With a known target position position updating can be achieved in real-time by the gimbal system In low-error environments or in applications where the required precision is suitably low position updating only requires the inversion of the rotation matrix and an analytic solution can be recovered This analytic solution can then be used as the initial point for approximate mean determination to achieve more accurate results in environments with high error or where greater precision is required Because the mean calculation is only based on a small subset of the range of available data one avenue for future research is improving the estimation method used to make the calculated mean more accurate 7 F UTURE W ORK Only a subset of potential error types in geo registration were considered here expanding the range of error parameters for which a solution has been derived as well as improving the robustness of the current error estimation would improve the overall effectiveness of the proposed system Additionally because the ultimate goal is to use the methods described to compute trajectory updates in real-time improving the overall speed of the necessary computations will allow the system to better complete its task One key area where improvement can be made is in the search methods used to identify the critical points in both the trajectory estimation and position updating Because each call of the trajectory estimation or position updating requires multiple calls of the relevant search function in both cases they represent the limiting factor in terms of the processing time of the system as a whole Finally further research should focus on extending the applications of trajectory estimation This can include multiple point tracking for a single object which provides an additional constraint on the system by requiring the distances 11
