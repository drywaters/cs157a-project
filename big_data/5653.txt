Benjamin.Rodriguez@jhuapl.edu Abstract\227 Hyperspectral longwave infrared 050LWIR\051 is used for a variety of targets such as gases and solids with the advantage of day or night data collections A longwave infrared system must have the ability to convert the radiance data it measures to emissivity prior to running a detection algorithm commonly called a temperature-emissivity separation 050TES\051 algorithm Key parts of this TES algorithm are accounting for the re\003ected downwelling radiation from the atmosphere upwelling background radiance removal and most importantly determining the temperature of the material Accounting for these environmental conditions allows for the data to be processed in emissivity to be used in the detection algorithm The processed data also allows a baseline to determine where key features exist in the signatures collected In this paper a new method is introduced to process 002eld collected signatures gathered using the Design  Prototypes microFTIR Model 102 The issue addressed here is calculating the collected signature from radiance to emissivity using a new technique for estimating the surface temperature of the collected sample The key component of the TES was created to ensure the collected spectra are processed in emissivity space at a quality that is suitable for the detection library on air and ground LWIR systems T ABLE OF

1 I NTRODUCTION Current remote sensing platforms have a vast array of integrated systems and sensors One such sensor is the hyperspectral longwave infrared 050LWIR\051 which is capable of capturing a variety of targets in both day and night conditions The LWIR sensor must have the ability to process data for temperature-emissivity separation 050TES\051 prior to running detection algorithms      This sensor collects a series of spectral emissivity signatures over the targets of  978-1-4799-1622-1/14 31  00 c 015 2014 IEEE 1 IEEEAC Paper 2552 Version 1 Updated 11/15/2013 interest using a spectrometer The raw data collected by the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy 050FTIR\051 spectrometer includes re\003ected downwelling atmosphere background radiance separation and target surface temperature all of these components must be considered when generating spectral emissivity signatures which can then be used in a detection algorithm If the surface temperature of the target material is unknown at the time of collection this results in an under-constrained problem in deriving the spectral emissivity of the target of interest    Thi s will result in a spectral emissivity signature that is not adequately suitable for detection library spectral emissivity signatures In this paper a new method to process 002eld-grade signatures collected by the Design  Prototypes 050D&P\051 microFTIR Model 102 system is introduced The new method addresses calculation of the surface temperature in signatures collected against solid materials in the 002eld of view 050FoV\051 of the FTIR spectrometer The method uses the apparent surface emissions of the material being measured at several water bands in the 8 000 12  5 micron 050 026 m\051 band to estimate the temperature of the material The signatures are processed from radiance to emissivity using the new surface temperature calculations and downwelling radiance If the initial temperature estimate is too low the emissivity in the water band regions will appear as more emissive than the rest of the target emissions If the estimated temperature is too high the emissivity in the water bands will appear to be lower than the rest of the target emissivity A variety of water bands across the whole 8 000 12  5 026 m regions is used to avoid one happening to fall near an absorption band feature of the substance being measured By iterating over temperatures and noting when the emissions in water bands 003ip one gets a temperature estimate of the surface temperature of the material This results in a spectral emissivity signature with a suf\002ciently accurate shape and magnitude to match detection library spectra The remainder of this paper is structured as follows In Section 2 related work in the area of radiance data collection and spectral emissivity conversion is discussed The presented method of estimating the surface temperature for solid materials in the FoV of the FTIR spectrometer is described in Section 3 Finding and analysis are provided in Section 4 Finally the conclusion and future work are described in Section 5 1 


2 R ELATED W ORK The spectral radiance collected by remote sensing systems is a superposition of self-emitted radiance from background targets and atmosphere       In par ticular the radiance 002eld in the LWIR region captured by the sensor is composed of mainly three components direct welling downwelling and upwelling L atsensor  L direct  L downwelling  L upwelling 0501\051 or more speci\002cally L 050 022 h 025 051  034 050 h 022 025 051\050  050 022 t  025 051 L BB 050 T s  025 051 0501 000  050 022 t  025 051\051 L DW R 050 025 051\051  L U W R 050 h 022 025 051 0502\051 where 022 is de\002ned as the zenith angle of the sensor with respect to earth normal 022 t is the zenith angle of the sensor with respect to the target normal h is the altitude of the sensor 025 is the radiance 002eld wavelength of interest T s is the surface temperature of the target L BB is the blackbody radiance at the target surface temperature L DW R and L U W R are the downwelling and upwelling radiances respectively and emissivity is denoted by   Direct welling radiation is de\002ned as the radiation coming directly from the target and can be affected by the surface temperature and type of material Downwelling is the radiation from the atmosphere and surroundings that can be re\003ected off the target being sensed It is usually measured near the time of the sample using a gold or crinkled aluminum 003at plate that diffusely re\003ects the sky and surrounding emissions It is an important contributor to the measured emissions of the sample The upwelling radiance is the radiance from the atmosphere that is due to the heat from humidity and other atmospheric factors Because most measurements are normally made within 1 meter of the sample this upwelling radiation is insigni\002cant 050except in signi\002cant water and carbon dioxide emission bands\051 In theory when these sources are removed or minimized the radiance that leaves a sensed surface could be determined by the self-emission function L s 050 022 t  T s  025 051   050 022 t  025 051 L BB 050 T s  025 051 0503\051 where L s is the self-emissivity and the spectra emissivity could be determined as follows  050 022 t  025 051  L s 050 022 t  T s  025 051  L BB 050 T s  025 051 0504\051 However in practice the self-emissivity radiance cannot be sensed directly due to atmospheric factors As mentioned above if those atmospheric effects are minimized by sensing close to the target material the 034 term approximates to 1 while L U W R tends to 0 this reduces Equation 2 to L s 050 022 t  T s  025 051   050 022 t  025 051 L BB 050 T s  025 051 0501 000  050 022 t  025 051\051 L DW R 050 025 051 0505\051 Rearranging Equation 5 and solving for  allows the spectral emissivity of a sample to be calculated if T s is known however in most cases T s is either unknown or cannot be measured To address this problem different methods have been proposed to estimate the surface temperature such as Blackbody Fit 050BBFIT\051 Maximum Spectral Temperature 050MAXSPEC\051 and Spectral Smoothness 050SMOOTHNESS\051 The simplest method to estimate T s is the Reference Channel 050REFCHAN\051 which assumes the emissivity is equal to 1 Under this assumption the blackbody function can be rearranged and solved for T s  However the assumption is not true in general thus limiting the uses of this approach For the BBFIT method the user de\002nes a wavelength range upon which the algorithm searches for a blackbody radiance function that maximizes emissivity MAXSPEC requires the collector to know the wavelength at which the maximum emissivity occurs and assumes it remains constant thus allowing the collector to solve Equation 5 the fractional downwelling radiance is subtracted and the remaining selfemitted radiance is scaled by maximum emissivity The algorithm SMOOTHNESS does not require any prior knowledge of maximum emissivity or the wavelength at which it occurs instead the algorithm measures radiance using a gold plate with the same con\002guration as the target material Assuming the sensor is close to the target the emissivity is considered 1 and thus atmospheric effects are negligible this leaves only three parameters to be determined Two other parameters spectral emissivity of gold and its temperature have been shown to have minimal impact on the spectral emissivity of the target despite large errors introduced while estimating emissivity of the plate To 002nd T s  the SMOOTHNESS authors proposed an algorithm that minimizes re\003ected atmospheric emission lines in a portion of a given spectrum In their experiments they used the short wavelength side of the silicate doublet The surface temperature of the target is found when the minimum point of an objective metric which involves the emissivity spectra of the target is located 3 W ATER A BSORPTION AND ITS C ONTRIBUTIONS TO M ATERIAL E MISSIVITY S PECTRA Water and green vegetation produce negligible spectral signatures in the longwave infrared spectral bands making them good blackbody candidates It is well known that the emissivity for objects within 8 to 12.5 micron 050 026 m\051 wavelengths are approximately constant normally around 0.96 or above  In a f ashi o n similar to the REFCHAN strategy where the emissivity is assumed to be 1 the algorithm proposed in this paper will determine surface temperature by 002nding the T s value that provides a 003at emissivity spectrum in pre-selected water band regions thus minimizing emissivity error Data Collection The D&P portable FTIR spectrometer Model 102 was used to collect the data for the experiments in this paper The collected data was sampled at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 000 1 over the spectral range from 2-25 026 m For the purposes of this paper the primary target material was in the longwave spectral region 0508-12.5 026 m\051 with the additional wavelength maintained for further analysis Collections were generally taken outdoors on clear days away from buildings and other potential thermal sources Samples were measured from approximately 1 meter away to reduce atmospheric effects Warm and cold blackbody calibration was used to account for 003uctuations in ambient temperature during collection and downwelling was measured using crinkled aluminum foil as the diffused plate for the collected re\003ected radiance Like other FTIR systems the D&P records the sample using an interferometer The data was processed by onboard software providing the initial spectral signature of the collected region The 002eld data collected is listed in Table 2 2

Figure 4  Payload Allocation Figure 5  Procurement vs Hosted Payloads Hosted payloads vs 100 procurement This case study focuses on the impact of including hosted payloads as part of the system Figure 5 presents an extended representation of the tradespace where hosted payload architectures are included The 002rst immediate conclusion that can be drawn is that based on the cost model from hosted payloads offer the possibility of signi\002cant cost reductions 050between 15 and 30%\051 As a result all architectures on the Pareto front rely on hosted payload architectures On the other hand concerns about using hosted payload assets for critical applications like astronaut support have been 003agged as a major caveat In this case an optimal solution would entail using a portfolio of hosted payloads and privately owned satellites and schedule the communications through ones or the others according to operational constraints Therefore building this portfolio can be done by analyzing what communication payloads are better suited for hosted payload con\002gurations Figure 6 presents the tradespace of architectures that mix hosted payload and procured assets Results indicate that including hosted payload assets in the system does not have a major impact on its performance but requires disaggregating the monolithic satellites identi\002ed as optimal in the previous case study That being the case the next questions arise Figure 6  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets Which payload obtains better savings when being hosted How many payloads do you want to 003y in a hosted payload approach The answer for the 002rst question can be obtained by analyzing the non-dominated architectures from 002gure 6 and estimating the cost savings when hosting the different types of antennas that are considered in this analysis Results indicate that hosting an optical payload can potentially save an 28 of the cost while a low data rate antenna 050S-band\051 only obtains a 16 cost reduction 050note that these numbers are based on the system life-cycle cost and are heavily in\003uenced by the hosted payload cost model\051 Therefore it seems to be more advisable to put high data rate payloads like optical terminals in commercial satellites and retain control of S-band communications 050which in turn ensures that contingency event will be addressed by privately owned assets not constrained by the operational limitations of host platforms\051 Finally 002gure 7 presents the tradespace of hosted payload architectures color coded by the number of antennas that are being hosted By looking at the Pareto front it can be seen that almost all architectures host one single antenna as opposed to two in order to minimize the burden on the host platform This burden is also contingent on the mass and power of the hosted communication payload This is the main reason why optical terminals become so attractive for hosted payload architectures as opposed to low frequency systems that require big parabolic antennas and power ampli\002ers to close the link budgets 6 C ONCLUSION Summary This paper has presented the 002rst set of results obtained through the developed architectural tool to evaluate space communication networks It has 002rst provided a high level overview of the tool with a description of four main constitutive elements An STK model an architecture generator an architecture evaluator and a resource manager Next it has described the newly developed scheduling algorithm based on a rule-based expert system that ef\002ciently allocates the network resources to satisfy near-Earth mission communication requirements Then a discussion on the conducted validation exercise has 11 


Figure 7  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets been presented in order to gain some level of con\002dence on the results that the tool outputs This discussion has focused on the validation of the scheduling algorithm by benchmarking it with operational schedules from the TDRSS Finally this paper has presented two case studies for future implementations of the TDRSS system Based on a demand forecast for the network a 002rst case study has considered the problem of selecting the frequency band to be supported and how to allocate them into the relay satellites It has been shown that maximum performance architectures require a mix of optical and RF payloads that support high throughput communications as well as reliable low data rate communications If the traditional procurement strategy is assumed 050NASA buys and operates the relay satellites\051 then monolithic architectures are preferable unless more than two high gain antennas render the resulting satellite con\002guration too complex In turn the second case study has extended this analysis by introducing architectures with hosted payloads It has been shown that according to the current available pricing model hosted payload architectures are clearly preferable than the traditional procurement strategy with cost savings between 15 to 30 for the same level of system performance It has then been discussed the advantages of having mixed procured and hosted payload architectures as a compromise to obtain networks with reduced lifecycle costs that can still address the requirements of highly sensitive and reliable applications Results have demonstrated that high data rate payloads 050speci\002cally optical payloads\051 are the best candidates to be hosted 050with savings up to 28%\051 thanks to their reduced mass and power requirement On the other hand low data rate communication payload should be allocated in privately owned satellites as they require bigger antennas and power ampli\002ers that increase the burden on the host platform Future Work The main streams of future work are as twofold On one hand additional features should be added to the model in order to better capture the complexity of the network con\002gurations 050e.g coupling between the costs of the communication payloads depending on the level of on-orbit processing the they perform\051 Additionally the size of the tradespace is currently limited to less than two thousand architectures due to computational limitations a stringent limitation given the possible combinations from the identi\002ed architectural decisions The solution currently under development is to include a genetic algorithm that alleviates this problem by iteratively generates new populations of architectures by combining the best previously evaluated networks On the other hand the other main stream of future work is related to exercising the tool in a variety of architectural decisions and mission scenarios In the presented case studies only geosynchronous constellations were considered although the tool allows comparing them with systems that place relays in MEO and LEO orbits Additionally the tool can also provide insight in valuing inter-satellite links and how the cost of putting in orbit their extra communication payloads can be leveraged by reducing the number of operating ground stations Moreover couplings between the payload allocation and fractionation strategy should also be further explored so as to understand if monolithic architectures still become preferable if relay satellites can be decomposed in clusters of independent antennas and payloads Finally supplementary what-if analysis can be conducted based on 0501\051 the demand forecast for the 2020-2030 time frame 0502\051 granted spectrum allocations to NASA and 0503\051 technology improvements that increase the spectral ef\002ciency of the communication payloads 12
