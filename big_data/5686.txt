and present practical payloads for operating live missions on actual 002eld sites Additionally we present and discuss mechanisms to manage data and perform post processing and identify preferred visualization environments and techniques to enable digital archiving of the cultural heritage site furthering both the state of conservation and the 002eld of cyberarcheology 2 B ACKGROUND Attempts to broaden the perspective of image acquisition in the 002eld of archeology to assist in the recording and documentation of cultural heritage sites is well described in recent publications The bene\002ts of imagery collected from elevated positions build a solid foundation in prior literature exposing opportunities for aerial imaging platforms based on UAVs to be a novel means of acquisition for cultural heritage w    Early efforts at high-perspective imaging in archeology describes successful data collection using a vertical retractable camera mount appliance designed to allow a ground operator to perform an acquisition campaign using a camera or image acquisition device from an elevated position While effective this technique is labor intensive and offers little 003exibility in the vantage points available to an operator The development of low-cost UAV technologies has presented a solid foundation in both the development of airframe and 003ight technologies as well as applications relevant to cultural heritage Although most contemporary efforts utilize UAV technology early efforts to perform aerial imaging favored manually controlled conventional 002xed wing and rotary wing v Le v eraging a strong hobbyist community for available parts and methods conventional model aircraft offered an inexpensive entry point to aerial imaging The hobbyist approach comes at the expense of requisite operator skill and intrinsically unavoidable large margins of position error associated with available instrumentation used to determine the position of the  Improvements to embedded systems and integrated inertial sensors have enabled more advanced 003ight control capabilities to aircraft bearing imaging payloads These added instruments provide not only an inexpensive way to accurately determine and track the position of an aerial vehicle but perform automated management of the 003ight trajectory via instructions compiled from ground-based mission planning software These advances in instrumentation not only bene\002t 002xed wing and single-rotor rotary wing aircraft but also enable practical implementations of the control systems required for multi-rotor rotary wing aircraft Unlike singlerotor and 002xed wing craft which have naturally stable 003ight modes multi-rotor craft require an active feedback loop for stabilization and correction of state  Despite requiring feedback control mechanisms to manage corrections to the system state the intrinsic 003ight dynamics of multi-rotor aircraft in closed loop are naturally more predictable and therefore provide easier control for operators with less 003ight experience The mechanical simplicity and predictable 003ight characteristics offered by multi-rotor aircraft provide signi\002cant advantages to the imaging community as an overwhelming majority of documented efforts largely favor multi-rotor imaging 3 P RINCIPLES OF I MPLEMENTATION Our aerial imaging platform is based on a multi-rotor helicopter design Selected for characteristic physical stability operational redundancy favorable handling and exceptional payload bearing attributes multi-rotor helicopter designs are ideal for aerial imaging and sensing Theory of Operation Multi-rotor helicopters share a common design framework consisting of a single plane of rotors in a radially symmetric con\002guration In the eight-rotor implementation rotors are mated in counter-rotating pairs in order to provide net-zero change in rotational inertia while dynamically changing the downward thrust from each pair Pairs are spaced radially and at equal distance from the center of the aircraft which also serves as the ideal center of mass In a scenario with no directional actuation equal force from all equally driven rotors will provide lift only in the upward vertical direction with no angular acceleration imparted to the aircraft Continuous aircraft attitude set-points are provided from the ground operator via direct 003ight controls or indirectly via autopilot waypoint instructions These attitude instructions feed into a linear controller which modulates the power input to each rotor through a mixing function based on the rotor con\002guration For example an operation to roll left would require an increase in the thrust and therefore rotational velocity of rotors on the starboard side of the airframe while decreasing thrust on the port side This change in the propulsion con\002guration offsets the center of thrust from the center of mass and in so doing imparts angular momentum into the system that we refer to as pitch roll and yaw Airframe The airframe serves as the structural foundation of the aircraft retaining the placement of the propulsion system providing rigid mounting of the 003ight control sensors and computer as well as offering a secure and stable mount for the imaging payload system While available from a number of different commercial vendors most airframes share a common structure that offers an impact tolerant landing gear assembly which shields the payload a common hub structure to support the 003ight control and auxiliary payload systems and a series of structural members which serve as outriggers from the hub to support the propellers and propulsion system At the expense of cost carbon 002ber is the favored structural material offering advantageous strength-to-mass qualities Lower cost alternatives for structural members include aluminum extrusion or high-strength plastic stencils which are also acceptable materials for interconnecting higher strength structural members Such a con\002guration allows the airframe to be constructed using carbon 002ber for rigidity but allows controlled breakpoints at weaker material intersections in the event of a collision leaving the most valuable components largely intact Rotor and Drive Control System For ef\002ciency the rotor drive and control system is based on lightweight and ef\002cient brushless motors Used commonly in hobbyist applications brushless motors inexpensively provide motive force at very high power-to-weight ratios and offer a 003exible and simple pulse-sequence drive interface to control power and speed Brushless motors are con\002gured symmetrically with optimized propellers selected to match the load of the propeller to the ef\002ciency points of the brushless motor 2 


Figure 2  Successive Loop Closure Model Delivering the power to the rotors is the drive control system which accepts instructions from the 003ight control system to specify the desired rotational velocity of each propeller The drive control system implements the motor drive interface using dedicated computer-based waveform generators altering frequency phase and amplitude to change the imparted power to each of the rotors Flight Control System The enabling technology behind the 003ight mechanics of a multi-rotor aircraft is the 003ight control system A multirotor aircraft requires electronic processing to combine highfrequency 003ight attitude corrections as derived by on-board sensors with required attitude corrections to maintain preplanned trajectory paths Since the desired 003ight attitude is sometimes controlled by a live ground operator and at other times by an automated 003ight path control systems it simpli\002es the control implementation to separate the system state into two parts each with a separate controller Since the 003ight control electronics must read sensors and update control inputs at a constant clock rate we model the physical dynamical plant and controller as a discrete time MIMO system x 050 k  1\051  A x 050 k 051  B u 050 k 051 0501\051 y 050 k 051  C x 050 k 051  D u 050 k 051 0502\051 While the feedback loop controlling the 003ight attitude is always running in 003ight control over physical position in space is sometimes done by a human pilot and sometimes by an autopilot programmed to follow pre-con\002gured waypoints We therefore separate the system state into two vectors The 003ight attitude is given by the system's Euler angles relative to the horizon along with their 002rst derivatives in Equation 0504\051 The UAV's position and velocity in space is similarly given in Cartesian coordinates in Equation 0505\051 x 050 k 051  f x 1 x 2 g  0503\051 x 1  010 015 _ 015 013 _ 013 014 _ 014 011  0504\051 x 2  010 037 _ 037 007 _ 007 Z _ Z 011  0505\051 The only control inputs to the system are the thrusts requested from each of the eight rotors We write this as a vector u\050k\051 u 050 k 051  f r 1 001 001 001 r 8 g  0506\051 The fast dynamics of the system are governed primarily by a relationship between u\050k\051 and the 003ight attitude Meanwhile the slow dynamics of the system are modeled well as a transfer function from the 003ight attitude to the spacial position This system lends itself well to control via successive loop closure as described in Figure 2 From this it can be seen that the outer loop controller F\050z\051 can be realized either by a human or electronic controller without the need to change the inner loop G\050z\051 This property makes it is possible to manually turn on and off the autopilot mid\003ight while the inner loop maintains smooth 003ight attitude In order to avoid inducing a yaw rotation balancing pairs must be established to make sure the cumulative moment on all rotors is zero In the case of a desired yaw rotation forward rotating propellers and reverse rotating propellers undergo equal but opposite angular acceleration providing constant downward thrust while imparting a non-zero rotational change in inertia to the propulsion assembly This residual in rotational inertia imparts a yaw acceleration on the aircraft while the thrust remains 002xed about the center of mass and imparts no lateral acceleration We determine the required thrust from each individual rotor Equation 0506\051 by summing the control inputs required for roll pitch yaw and altitude correction Since the actuation and system dynamics can be described very accurately using a linear model the principle of superposition holds allowing us to mix the outputs from four independent attitude controllers into four six or eight control inputs to individual rotors depending on multi-rotor con\002guration With these four inputs any 003ight path can be executed by the aircraft within the limits of the thrust drive system and stability of the linear model and controller At a minimum a viable 003ight control system requires gyroscopic and acceleration-based sensing to detect minor unintended changes in attitude and velocity resulting from environmental 003uctuations sensor noise or errors in controls algorithms Input from standard ground control links deliver noti\002cations of desired displacements in trajectory which are combined with stability correction data Information about the propulsion topology of the aircraft are used to perform gain adjustments to correct individual rotor speeds based on the measured error in attitude displacement The 003ight control system delivers the desired propulsion instructions to the drive control system using any number of available common interfaces which render the actual changes in thrust 3 


Figure 3  Early Prototype in Flight Autopilot System The autopilot system interfaces to the 003ight control system using an optional interface to supplement or entirely replace the direct user input to modify the trajectory of the aircraft Additional location and direction sensors such as magnetometers and global positioning systems assist the autopilot in determining the location and trajectory of the aircraft as governed by waypoints Pre-programmed or updated during 003ight via a ground telemetry radio interface waypoints indicate the desired constraints in the 003ight path as speci\002ed by the user Additional instructions or annotations of programmed waypoints determine how waypoint constraints are used to adjust attitude and velocity of the aircraft Parameters such as positional tolerance desired speed navigational waypoints and stall time dictate the speci\002c execution of a rendered trajectory Camera Stabilization System A requisite component for aerial imaging platforms is the payload interface which supports and directs the imaging payload to the desired imaging target Although direct frame mounting is possible an actuated gimbal assembly is favored to isolate both spurious and intentional perturbations in attitude of the airframe from the attitude of the imaging payload Mounted to the gimbal an imaging sensor payload is stabilized using an active correction system These corrections are derived using angular attitude measurements from 003ight control calculations to estimate the error in attitude which are then corrected for using servos inbuilt in the gimbal Additionally intentional changes can be imparted to the attitude of the imaging payload to make targeting adjustment without changing the trajectory of the aircraft 4 UAV S YSTEM S PECIFICATIONS Development of suitable 002eld-deployable airframes has undergone several iterations Focused on developing solutions to reliably carry imaging payloads to new vantage points in resource-limited sites our aircraft were constructed to meet the needs of the imaging campaign while maintaining 003exibility towards operating in resource limited environments To this end we generally classify our earlier implementations as focusing on 002eld 003exibility and differentiate our later implementations on payload capacity operational stability and improving mission 003ight duration Figure 4  Fully-integrated airborne imaging platform First Generation Platform The 002rst UAV platform constructed for remote and aerial imaging represented a valuable 002rst step towards a complete adaptation and proving of the multi-rotor system The intrinsic redundancy of a the symmetrical airframe with an even number of motors producing lift ensured that even if failure were to occur and disable a single motor controller or motor assembly the craft could maintain a suf\002cient maneuverability for a controlled descent The software and microcontroller on board sensor are capable of adapting to changes in the environment allowing the craft to have reaction times unattainable without manual intervention For the purposes of acquisition and research in remote 002eld locations the platform adequately implements a proof of concept However issues regarding integration and 002eld resiliency provided a need for a more integrated platform Field Operations Customized Platform Building upon the success of the proof of concept platform an improved airframe was constructed with the goal of furthering the payload rigidity and durability requirements of an aerial imaging craft for the purposes of 002eld investigation and discovery Additionally the entire airframe landing assembly and camera mounting platform was fabricated from internal designs to perform integration of the gimbal and imaging payload with interchangeable power storage packs and interchangeable communications modules Thrust and mission models were used to select optimized motor drivers and larger rotors for increased ef\002ciency allowing for expanded payload capability and a more accurate prediction of runtime The result of these design alterations was a UAV capable of takeoff mass up to 12 kilograms and sustained 003ight time of up to 40 minutes depending on payload and environmental conditions It is with this platform and its design derivatives that we are developing for forthcoming 002eldwork Lighter than Air Platforms As an alternative to powered aircraft we supplement our acquisition 003eet with lighter than air acquisition platforms The system consists of an aerostat wind capable balloon a self-stabilizing camera gimbal with interchangeable payload camera modules This balloon platform was designed to provide a stable platform in winds up to 50 mph while still providing lift of up to twenty pounds While the aerostat balloon does an outstanding job in reducing maintaining 4 


a stable platform a gimbal comparable to those used on the multi-rotor platforms is required The balloon platform offers a conceptual alternative to multi-rotor campaigns in that maneuverability is traded for ease of use 5 C AMERA P AYLOADS A number of useful imaging payloads are commonly attached to our aerial imaging vehicles While all mechanisms collect visual image data they vary in resolution mechanism of activation rate of acquisition 050in both sampling density and temporal frequency\051 and timeliness of delivery to the ground These variations enable different specialized use scenarios depending on the needs of the imaging Live Analog Video Live analog video delivery involves the transport of immediate-mode imagery using low cost equipment Operating similar to analog TV an NTSC signal from an inexpensive camera is modulated onto a suitable license-free operating frequency and is transported in a standard 6 Mhz NTSC broadcast television carrier envelope Similar processes exist for other video standards such as PAL On the receiving end specialized tuning equipment to select non-standard channels is used to capture and display the received image data While inexpensive this transport is disadvantaged in diagnostic utility due to signi\002cant range issues low visual quality which is easily susceptible to radio noise and cumbersome to digitally archive transport and manage Embedded Video Capture As an alternative to live analog video delivery embedded video capture devices forgo the immediate-mode viewing capabilities for higher resolution video capture lower operational cost and ease of digital management using native digital storage formats Products such as the GoPro Hero3 allow direct to digital storage of video at resolutions up to 4k for extended recording intervals While this payload increases the resolution of the data acquired it presents challenges for remote delivery selective triggering and single-event acquisitions of higher resolutions MultiMode Professional Camera To offer a balance in acquisition monitoring and capture modes our preferred payload is a professional digital single lens re\003ex 050SLR\051 camera supporting remote triggering of both video and photographic acquisition SLR camera devices offer signi\002cant performance improvements in resolution for single-image acquisitions providing resolutions in the tens of megapixels SLR cameras generally have a number of 003exible interfaces for remote triggering of mode selection and capture operations and offer video capture at resolutions equal to embedded capture solutions albeit at higher qualities delivered via higher encoder bit rates and more advanced codec pro\002les However storage of data collected by the camera is still managed onboard the camera as acquired images from a campaign are not available for immediate inspection until the aircraft lands and the data are manually of\003oaded In addition to the camera we introduce a dedicated digital video compression network appliance to enable live monitoring and passive data logging of a 003ight mission via the transmission of 1080p high de\002nition view\002nder data from the camera In conjunction with professional-grade wireless data radios the immediate mode inspection of view\002nder data can Figure 5  A direct inspection image of a conservation site be accomplished at considerable ranges extending to several hundred meters under even the most undesirable outdoor radio propagation environments Further collected efforts to extend coverage via directional antennas and optimized communications paths can improve the suitable link range to several kilometers offering a signi\002cant performance improvement over analog video delivery The convenience offered by digital delivery of view\002nder imagery has a cost the latencies required for the digital compression mechanism allow for best-case performance on the order of several hundred milliseconds These latencies are in practice suf\002cient for the pointing and management of the camera during an acquisition campaign but are not suf\002ciently responsive to perform immediate-mode piloting maneuvers The professional camera payload con\002guration allows a number of sophisticated acquisition scenarios not available from less 003exible embedded imaging devices Externally activated acquisition triggers allow for the capture of high-resolution images at locations of interest allowing a systematic documentation and sampling of a site While such campaigns can be automated via parametric data derived from ground surveys remote triggering and live delivery of viewport data provide a unique tool to reliably operate a campaign ad-hoc from the perspective of the ground operator based on sight alone The introduction of digital viewport delivery also enables the reliable and opportunistic capture of imagery collected during the entire imaging mission As the primary focus of aerial imaging missions is to collect speci\002c and relevant site information the on-board resources of the camera are therefore dedicated to cover the needs of these speci\002c acquisitions In delivering live viewport data to ground terminals image data parasitically collected for live inspection can be archived on the ground at no-cost offering supplementary data to the primary imaging campaign or offering a rollback diagnostic tool to re\002ne 003ight paths or primary capture techniques These supplementary data come only at the cost of requiring relatively low amounts of disk space on a ground observation terminal in many practical usage scenarios no special considerations need to be made to enable the collection of this data Specialized Cameras and Sensors While the most compelling usage of airborne sensing platforms is performed using visible-range cameras the prospective utility in using non-visible multispectral cameras or even 5 


Figure 6  The UAV collecting Image in Figure 5 non-imaging sensors is compelling Thermography using passive thermal infrared imaging systems offers interesting opportunity to detect subsurface artifacts equally applicable to archaeological excavation or in a state of conservation assessment Alternatively non-imaging sensors can be used to collect environmental information 050such as air composition background radiation sensitive inertial measurements or target/range sensing\051 or even provide support to ground operations using communications payloads These alternatives often invite broader applications beyond cultural heritage interests but are nonetheless offer utility as primary or secondary data sources during conservation or digitization efforts 6 D ATA P ROCESSING Data collected from an aerial imaging platform can be disseminated using a multitude of techniques These methods range from direct inspection requiring minimal to no processing to more complex techniques which stratify the context of the sampled image data within a large collection of image samples or create volumetric reconstructions using samples from multiple viewpoints using structure from motion Direct Inspection The most common and straightforward inspection technique for images acquired from an aerial imaging platform is direct inspection Direct inspection involves the of\003ine management and viewing of individual photographs with the intent of creating more complete views of a cultural heritage site previously unavailable from traditional ground imaging positions This holistic view when combined with alternative image data collected using terrestrial sampling techniques can provide a more complete understanding of a cultural heritage site While subjectively informative direct inspection alone provides no concrete mechanism to correlate data from multiple acquisition perspectives and techniques and introduces no objective means of classifying the view Nevertheless managing data collected for the purpose of direct inspection serves as the cornerstone and 002rst step towards more advanced diagnostic processes Tiled Photo Stitching While direct inspection can offer a single view from a new perspective tiled photo stitching offers a way to capture multiple perspectives of an entire site in high resolution from a single perceived view position A tiled photo stitching acquisition campaign involves a series of sequentially acquired downward projecting views over sub-regions of an area of interest Each acquired photo shows a sub-region at a resolution derived from the physical resolution of the camera and the placement of the airborne imager Each photograph is taken such that there are overlapping boundaries with neighboring acquisitions providing a mechanism for any number of available stitching tools to assemble the campaign into a single image The resulting image is of both high resolution and high coverage area allowing for single-image inspections of both small detailed loci and the entire site Structure from Motion Images taken from a sampling campaign can also be used to construct sparse point cloud models of areas of interest within the cultural heritage site Using images collected from different perspectives of a single object or area of interest provides suf\002cient visual information to describe the geometry of the sampled object Using structure from motion techniques imaging campaigns can be created and executed such that spare point models can be derived from the imagery In addition to presenting the surface appearance of the object these derived models can capture the three dimensional geometry of an object for later examination in any number of immersive digital exploration en  7 E VOLUTION TO A PPLIED V ISUALIZATION In parallel with the development and evolution of airborne sensing platforms research in visualization technologies has laid the groundwork for cogent and interactive dissemination of visual data collected from airborne imaging platforms These platforms and techniques offer some of the most compelling applications and venues of new research for data collected using airborne imagers Immersive Display Environments Arguably the ultimate goal of data collection via airborne platforms or any data collection methodology applied to cultural heritage is to produce the most complete and holistic record possible for the site Complementing these collection endeavors immersive display environments and the research efforts conducted therein offer a venue to display complete and immersive visual representations of data collected from aerial platforms Immersive display environments conceptually focus on the coordination of multiple commodity computer display systems physically arranged in manner centric to one or more viewers Software coordination aims to present a uni\002ed viewport to all screens allowing a visual inspection environment naturally suited to displaying reconstructed environment Natively however data collected directly during airborne imaging campaigns do not represent volumetric environments Therefore processing is required to develop these Volume Reconstruction Processes Alone planar image data collected from an aerial platform offer little utility in an immersive display environment However research in volumetric reconstruction processes including structure from motion and terrain/planar perspective mapping techniques prepare systematic or ad-hoc data collected in the course of aerial imaging into an immersive format In so doing planar image captures from individual positions can be used to make a coherent three-dimensional model which can in turn 002t more naturally to being viewed in a 6 


Figure 7  Structure from motion reconstruction based on the Neolithic site of Wadi Fidan 61 in southern Jordan immersive display environment While the scienti\002c research associated with developing both display systems and volume reconstruction techniques is beyond the scope of developing airborne imaging platforms preliminary outcomes from applying these technologies appear to be one of the most intriguing directions for new applications in digitizing and disseminating cultural heritage   8 C ONCLUSIONS We discuss and motivate the utility of airborne imaging in cultural heritage applications and provide an evolutionary overview of airborne imaging in cultural heritage Additionally we present the fundamental concepts behind multi-rotor aircraft and describe the design evolution of our implementation for a functional aerial acquisition platform for use in cultural heritage 002eldwork In concert with the airframe design we classify the acquisition modalities of practical imaging payloads for 003ight in addition to nominating mechanisms to disseminate and post-process disseminated data Finally we discuss applications to visualization and opportunities of

Figure 6 Memory hierarchy behaviors among different workloads DataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average L2 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 21 while that for HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 4.8 5.1 14 and 16 respectively Among BigDataBench  most of the online service workloads have the higher L2 cache MPKI on the average 40 except Nutch server 4.1 while most of the of\003ine and realtime analytics workloads have the lower L2 cache MPKI on the average 13 except BFS 56 Third the average L3 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 1.5 while the average number of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 2.4 2.3 1.4 and 1.9 respectively This observation shows that the LLC L3 caches of the processors Xeon E5645 on our testbed are ef\002cient for the big data workloads corroborating the observation in DCBench  The ef\002ciency of L3 caches also can explain why the 003oating point intensity of BigDataBench on the Xeon E5645 is higher than on the Xeon E5310 only two levels of caches The TLB behaviors are shown in Figure 6-2 First the average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 0.54 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 0.006 0.005 0.06 and 0.08 respectively The more ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench may be caused by the complex third party libraries and deep software stacks of the big data workloads Second the average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is also higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 2.5 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 1.2 0.7 2 and 2.1 respectively And we can also 002nd that the numbers of DTLB MPKI of the big data workloads range from 0.2  Nutch server  to 14  BFS  The diversity of DTLB behaviors re\003ects the data access patterns are diverse in big data workloads which proves that diverse workloads should be included in big data benchmarks  Lessons Learned  On a typical state-of-practice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that L3 caches of the processor are ef\002cient for the big data workloads which indicates multi-core CPU design should pay more attention to area and energy ef\002ciency of caches for the big data applications The high number of L1I cache MPKI implies that better L1I cache performance is demanded for the big data workloads We conjecture that the deep software stacks of the big data workloads are the root causes of high frond-end stalls We are planning further investigation into this phenomenon by changing the software stacks under test e.g replacing MapReduce with MPI 7 Conclusion In this paper we presented our joint research efforts with several industrial partners on big data benchmarking Our methodology is from real systems covering not only broad application scenarios but also diverse and representative real-world data sets We proposed an innovative data generation methodology and tool to generate scalable volumes of big data keeping the 4 V properties Last we chose and developed nineteen big data benchmarks from dimensions of application scenarios operations algorithms data types data sources software stacks and application types Also we reported the workloads characterization results of big data as follows 002rst in comparison with the traditional benchmarks the big data workloads have very low 


operation intensity Second the volume of data input has non-negligible impact on micro-architecture characteristics of big data workloads so architecture research using only simple applications and small data sets is not suf\002cient for big data scenarios Last but not least on a typical state-ofpractice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that for the big data workloads the LLC of the processor is effective and better L1I cache performance is demanded as the big data workloads suffer high L1I cache MPKI 8 Acknowledgements We are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd Dr

  Paper 2581 Version 2  14   Flight i nformation and processing   Presentation and projection of flight profiles   Real time operational information   Managing both pilot operator and air traffic controller workloads   Procedural processes supported by enhanced automation capabilities   Control sector complexity and management   Separation a ssurance   Airspace d esign and p rocedures   Investment in resolving these constraints  will drive the rate of adoption in civil UAS operations in the NAS One p art of the investment will be driven by the FAA\222s \223F acilities and Equipment\224 F&E Budget over  the next ten years Another part will be driven by defense and federal investment  in R&D  The remaining part will be driven by private investment seeking to develop profitable supplie r s and manufacturing firms of UAS Unfortunately   private investment will not fully launch until there is a clear indication of the public investment into implementing the requisite air traffic management  and air traffic control  ATM/ATC changes into the NAS infrastructure and there i s a common  approach through avionic standards in UA V  equipage   It is expected that avionic standards would lower the end user costs The impact on NAS infrastructure is the outline in the following subsection  Today\222s Air Traffic Control System  Today\222s air traffic control system is built around four basic pillars. These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
