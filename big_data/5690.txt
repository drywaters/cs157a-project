Marvasti VMware aharutyunyan;apoghosyan;ngrigoryan;mazda}@vmware.com   Abstract 227We examine the determination of abnormality of streamed data using the statistical structure of the meta-data associated with it. The vital need for such a subject within a heterogeneous log based environment in real-time comes from the fact that most cloud based applications will use text-based logging as a means of reporting application behavior. The sheer volume of such logs makes retrospective analysis infeasible due to large processing and storage requirements. Our 
approach is based on conversion of the original data stream into meta-data \(graph\ and revealing the dominating \(normal statistical patterns within it. Real-time analysis of the stream compared with the meta-data model determines the degree of anomaly of the current data. The resulting graph also reveals the fundamental structure \(\223behavioral footprint\224\f the data beyond the sources \(physical or virtual devices\d processes  Index Terms 227Cloud and virtualization management, log analysis, big data, events stream, normalcy structure, anomaly and change detection I  I NTRODUCTION 
 We treat the problem of statistical structure retrieval from data streams within the \223big data\224 model [1  T h e relevance of this kind of analysis is dictated by rapidly growing needs to make run-time decisions on abnormality of cloud based environments from which log data can be streamed. Examples include application logs, user behavior data, social network data, etc A fundamental approach to data-agnostic management of data centers applies the dynamic thresholding of monitoring data collected from IT resources instead of out-of-date static or hard thresholding technique. The dynamic thresholds \(DT\ of a time series metric are the appropriate upper and lower bounds computed using variability, change point 
and cyclicality of the data \(see 4   In this paper we extend the concept of dynamic thresholding of time series data to any kind of data that is a stream of records and events. In other words, we introduce the notion of normalcy of those streams as an extracted statistical structure and develop a mechanism for their abnormality detection in run-time mode In ou e e m p l o y ed directed g r aph s to  extract patterns from unstructured data. Here we use the same graph model as a tool for capturing the meta-data patterns of streaming log files to determine system anomaly states, based on its historic \223normalcy structure\224, accounting also for change-points occurring in the stream. Prior related work includes the papers by Lin and Siewiorek d

Another related problem is the workflow model discovery and its transactional improvement from event based logs t h is re g a rd, ou r an al y s is  is generic in terms of relying on non-contextual and non-rule based pattern extraction in data streams compared to those works \(see also references therein\. Moreover, it builds on a global correlation structure of the stream to quantify degrees of abnormalities occurring run-time, as well as to localize 223responsible anomaly sources\224 with their contributions to the overall abnormality. No prior research to the best of our 
knowledge directly targets this setting Our approach is based on conversion of the original stream into a meta-data and revealing the dominating \(normal\stical patterns within it. The meta-data is formed via a graph representing different \223event types\224 \(nodes which are detected in the stream along with \223event sources\224 they are associated within the stream. Two nodes in this graph are adjacent if the corresponding event types are in proximity by a time frame and an \223event source\224. The behaviors of those sources in terms of generating different event types create probabilistic correlations between graph nodes computed with application of that proximity measure The characterized probabilistic graph represents the normal 
or dominating common behavioral structure that the stream historically follows independently of the event sources Having this historical normalcy, we are then able to estimate the upcoming stream portions in terms of their deviation from the extracted structure. This is performed through matching the event types in the new data entries with historical graph and checking whether conditionally the most probable event types are realized in the observation window From this we can quantify the deviation of the current data segment from the most typical \(historical\atterns. This quantity actually measures the abnormality degree of the stream One of the main problems in processing of data belonging to \223big data\224 field is the limited availability of 
data for retrospective analysis. By its very nature, limits on storage and I/O can severely restrict algorithms that require the complete data set to be available for analysis. In terms of this restriction, our algorithm is highly scalable. Converting the data stream into a graph structure representing the metadata, we retain the useful content of the data and build the wanted statistical structure without any need for retrospective analysis We apply our method to a set of vCenter \(VMware\222s virtualization management software\ logs. Using the 978-1-4799-0913-1/14/$31.00 \2512014 IEEE 


 Therefore the conditional probability between two event types provoked by all possible event sources can be determined with hereinafter usage of concise notations  jiP or ji P   The prior probabilities of event types can be also computed by the frequency LTNTP i i  information on event types and on fleeting VM\222s \(or hosts as sources of those event types, we are able to determine the statistical normalcy structure of the stream by the above mentioned graph. Comparison of real-time data to this graph allows us to then determine abnormality patterns. Through that comparison we estimate the degree of abnormality that can be used by an alerting engine within an infrastructure management system. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to normalcy analysis of virtualized environments at different hierarchical levels \(VM, host, cluster, etc The normalcy structure represents the image of pure event type correlations independently of the event sources in the heterogeneous system. In other words, it is the fundamental structure \(\223behavioral footprint\224\ the data beyond underlying sources \(physical or virtual\ and processes. Thus another benefit of this method is that comparison of the current data portions with the meta-data graph may shed light on sources of abnormal situations II  S TREAM TO M ETA D ATA C ONVERSION  We interpret the streamed log data as a flow of text consisting of events with associated event types and event sources \(which can be detected via a log parsing procedure The procedure outlined for the automatic detection of event attributes in [4 n e e x a m p l e o f a n e v en t d e tectio n  m e chanism. This is the basic assumption behind our algorithm on processing of streamed log data in terms of extracting its fundamental statistical characteristics. Say the stream contains I different types i T of events and K different sources k S of events. We aim at investigating how those types are correlated along with emerging stream inputs independently of the sources they are associated with Two types i T and j T are considered to be related with each other from short term perspectives, if they appear in the stream attached to the same source k S and within a time window t  where Ii 1 002 Hence, the probability of appearance of i T under an observed type j T both associated with k S be estimated by the following frequency  002 002 K k kji j ji tSTTN TN tTTP 1   1   as ratio of joint occurrences  tSTTN kji   and L stands for the number of events read from the stream In view of the above definitions, the conditional probability  ji TTP becomes a tool for measuring the \223common behavior\224 of event types abstracted from underlying event sources. Having computed the prior and conditional probabilities between event types we can build the structure in Fig. 1 showing a weighted graph of event types with those conditionals on edges. Note that the above mentioned frequencies can be updated cumulatively and the corresponding meta-data in form of a directed graph can be updated with the expansion of the stream. Interestingly, this stream-to-meta-data conversion can be implemented by the map/reduce programming model   III  T HE N ORMALCY S TRUCTURE  The constructed meta-data graph of Fig. 1 can be viewed as the dynamically and historically built structure of pairwise correlations of event types. This is the graph used for processing historical normalcy and run-time decision making on abnormality behavior of the stream Flowchart 1 describes the main parts of our analysis and their interrelation. The overall algorithm behind this study will be described in detail below Flowchart 1. Main flows of the algorithm  Training of the model We define the normalcy structure of the stream by its meta-data and in terms of the dominating statistical relations in the graph of Fig. 1. Analogous to outlier removal in time series data, small conditional probabilities are considered to be outliers and thus can be removed from analysis. Eliminating small conditional probabilities from the graph edges \(a sensitivity parameter is applied\ we reduce it to its dominating correlations subgraph\(s\. We call this graph Dynamic Normalcy Graph DNG\ be easily seen that the DNG is the stream\222s 002 In other words, to determine the correlations between event types we apply a proximity pair criterion  tS k 002 of the type pair  ji TT in the stream over the number   j TN of observed type j T independently of k S  Kk 1

And let  MqQ be the 003  1  jm jii jiP is performed over the conditional probabilities on the directed edges arising from the node j in DNG  wM 003  1  jm jii jiP as well as in historical footprint of common probabilistic behavior of event types that result from all possible event sources Scoring/Ranking The event types in the current observation window are mapped to the DNG to compare the mismatch between the run-time scenarios to those in historical mode. The degree of mismatch represents the degree of abnormality of the real-time data  Fig. 1. Meta-data graph of event types 7 002  002=\002  1  wk k k wjwj  Those event types can be matched on the DNG and the edges having matched nodes can be highlighted. We can then compute the probabilistic mismatch \(i.e. the abnormality degree\ between this matched sub-graph and the DNG \(relying on the graph isomorphism concept\y the following formula 002  002 002  1  wk k k wSMwM  where  wSM k  I   Let 21  wj TTT 002 And let the subset   21 wjjj k TTT 002 In other words, the following holds 002 be the event types registered in the current observation window w 002 003  002 003  002 wj j jm jii wj j jm jii k jiP jiP wSM k  and where we assume that nodes adjacent \(in DNG j  nodes are enumerated from 1 to  jm We also enumerate the absent nodes in w 212 q th quantile of M Then we define the historical abnormality  0 wD  s corresponds to 9.0 MQ and the lowest 0  s to the maximum of M  The deduced level   0 wD 002 lies in the interval  100   0   Measuring the mismatch between the run-time flow of events and the historical normalcy allows us to control unacceptable deviations and generate alarms. For that purpose, first we keep track of historic anomalies and estimate their usual \(normal\ level. That can be performed by simple measures such as whiskers method \(that recognizes the concentration of data points from out-ofrange values\d high quantile cut of data, or the sophisticated DT computation technology In particular, let  2 1 wMwMwMM h 002 above   0 wD 002 stands for a mismatch assigned to source k S and calculated by 100     1  1  1  1 002 from 1 to  jm Note that the summation in 002 002\002  be the series of subsequent mismatches calculated along the historical application of the obtained DNG to the stream with a moving w 002 according to the method of whiskers as 5.1\,75.0 0 MIQR MQwD  002 where  MIQR is the interquartile range \(the difference between 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles\f M In an alternative way   0 wD 002 can be defined also as 0.9 or higher quantile of M regulated by a sensitivity parameter  1  0  002 is used in run-time estimate of abnormality. So only the abnormalities with their mismatch  wM 002 are reported. This means that the real and relative abnormality degree  wD 002  in run-time mode can be obtained with the following difference  0 wDwMwD 002\212\002=\002  Here the approach can be extended to apply a dynamic thresholding technique \(e.g o r s o f t er abn o r m alit y control \(see also the study [9 d ref e ren ces t h erein  In other words, instead of   0 wD 002 we can compute its dynamic \(time-dependent\ version   0 twD 002  IV  I NDICATING A BNORMALITY S OURCES  During the abnormality detection by the above mentioned mismatch calculation, the event types which contribute to the mismatch can be identified. Then those event types can be checked in terms of the event sources associated with them.

 2 2 LG respectively. Estimate of their similarity with  2 21 LGLGSim tells us how close the adaptive data tail to the overall process is. As soon as we detect only a 50%  similarity \(or another parameterized quantity\, then we have to declare a change point and replace  the basic historic meta-data   1 LG with the moving one  2 2 LG and proceed with the rest of algorithmic blocks as shown in  Flowchart 1. With these settings we don\222t target a sensitive change point detection problem but only a global change identification in the stream occurred in its recent structure versus its overall structure. The tail size and C 005 EE by setting 0  21  GGSim  To verify whether the stream has substantially changed during its development, we take advantage of its meta-data structure again, now for recent period of the original stream containing 2 L events from total length L assuming 2 L  is large enough to provide sufficient statistics. This means that as soon as the sufficient st atistics is available we initiate generating a parallel construction of a meta-data graph for 2 L 226recent size \(tail\f the stream. Then we keep updating this graph along with the evolution of the data sliding the tail window with size 4 LC 003 21  2|1 2121 2121 21  1  EE GPGP VVEE VVEE GGSim jiji ji ji  where  111 EVG 002 be the event sources that proximate the event types   21 wjjj TTT indicating the most likely sources of abnormality can be generated. To generate those recommendations and indicating the highly \223responsible\224 event sources in an unacceptable abnormality, let 21  wk SSS 007 and   222 EVG 002 in run-time mode. For each event source k S we compute its mismatch  wSM k  k This measure ranges from  1  0  with maximum similarity 1  In the similarity formula above the first fraction is responsible for the geometric similarity of the graphs and the second for the probabilistic closeness.

Additionally, to compress the structure only strong correlations \(higher 0.8 illustrated. Similar graphs are obtained for a series of experiments that confirm that the vCenter has its inherent statistical and fundamental structure of event type behaviors independent of the applications that run on the VM\222s Those experiments were performed for different portions of the vCenter log containing more than 1,000,000 event records as well as for the whole data set. In all cases it was possible to derive a DNG with high probabilistic connections between a subset of defined event types Several observations from the obtained DNG can be made I  DNG contains an unconnected fragment \(nodes 32 and 33\ub-graph, which means that the virtual center imprints isolatable event types. In case of the nodes 32 and 33, one can make a conclusion that most of the time 94%\VmBeingRelocatedEvent+info\224 results in 223VmRelocatedEvent+info\224 with 6% failure that would result in an abnormality situations II  There are event types with only outgoing connections like node 29\ and event types with only incoming connections \(node 4\ other words, the composite event type \223VmRegisteredEvent+info\224 inevitably leads a collection of event types \(23,51,49, etc.\eanwhile a series of event types \(2,5,16, etc.\ltimately lead to 223VmResourceReallocatedEvent+info\224 002 and generate the following series   2 1 wSMwSMwSM wk 002 002 002 002 Those sources are then prioritized with the corresponding mismatches and displayed for the final recommendation to the user as indications of abnormality sources V  O N C HANGE P OINT D ETECTION  Global changes in the stream which are able to skew our abnormality analysis can also be detected with a procedure comparing two meta-data portions from the stream in terms of mismatch between their graph-wise representations For quantification of similarity between two historical streams we introduce the following measure 005 212 212\327 327 006+\006 005+\005  002 The latter assumes that we refresh the graph nodes/connections obtained due to the scanning of the stream in the first 4 L part of the tail with the new nodes/connections observed in the last 4  L portion of the tail observed by the sliding window. At each stage of this moving structure update we have two meta-data graphs basic one and the moving one, conventionally denoting them  1 LG and

For example, \223VmInstanceUuidConflictEvent+error\224 \(49\ generates \223VmInstanceUuidChangedEvent+info\224 \(51\without any alternative. The same happens with \223VmRenamedEvent+warning\224 \(35 and \223VmReconfiguredEvent+info\224 \(11\, however these event types have no impact on other types and are of no influence to the rest of the system  Fig. 2. Normalcy structure \(DNG\ vCenter events The extracted DNG becomes the \223behavioral footprint\224 of the virtual center in terms of VMs behaviors. It means that the lifecycle of any VM should follow the structure that the DNG dictates. Any deviation introduced by VMs in the current stream becomes the abnormalities. It can be either an evolving critical abnormality or an out-of-normal state that can also be inherent to the stream in terms of its historical behavior. That is why we evaluate typical out-of-normalcy so called historical abnormality\ the stream in order to differentiate it from the abnormality that needs to become an alert Table 1.

This data set consisted of key short-term economic indicators \(EI\ of OECD countries available at http://stats.oecd.org is an international economic organization of 34 countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. Also data of 8 non-member countries with large economies are included We aimed at extracting the normalcy structure of EIs for above mentioned countries within 1995-2007 and detecting the abnormality or change in that structure provoked by the recent economic recession. In this scenario, the event sources are the member countries and the event types are their main short-term \(quarterly\s relative to the preceding period. Table 3 shows the event types participating in the DNG of OECD+8 economic normalcy structure of Fig. 5. Overall, 20 key indicators \(with theoretically possible 60 event types \226 positive, negative, and zero changes in indicators being different event types\ are included in the analysis. However, only 17 positive change indicators constitute this DNG.

By a convolutional extraction of a representative meta-data from the stream we create the stream\222s \223behavioral footprint\224 and use this in run-time evaluation of the underlying system on the current data flows. The meta-data can be stored in form of a graph based on an \223event source\224/\223event type\224 principle Application of our approach to IT data sets results in extension of the traditional normalcy analysis of time series data obtained from monitoring of IT infrastructures to include modern cloud infrastructures with high order of transiency. Furthermore, the method is applied to processing of log data generated by virtual centers. The new insight that we get here is that the dynamic environment produced by fleeting VMs can be projected via some probabilistic laws on behavioral event types. Matching this image \(graph\with a run-time image one can come up with abnormality estimate of the transient infrastructure with additional capability to localize the underlying sources of misbehaviors Due to universality of the proposed algorithm, the meta-data construction model and related analysis is applicable to data sets from various applications with similar anticipated results. This was demonstrated by applying the algorithm to economics data showing the 2008 \223Great Recession\224 event Determining \223event source\224 and \223event type\224 would allow a \223behavioral footprint\224 of the meta-data to be created which can then be used in real-time to determine brakeage of correlation as an abnormality indicator R EFERENCES  1  T.

 In order to identify the closest competitors of the focal product easily from the consideration map, we draw a circle around th e focal product encompassing exactly 5 products \(includi ng the focal product\e chose 5 products since the mean consideration set size of the focal product is 4.64 \(see Table 8 consideration ranking and the consideration clustering indicate brand to be a key driver for joint consideration. We therefore transpose brand onto the consideration map and fi nd that several formations \(or groups ds \(as indicated by the ovals in Figure 4\mi ng the findings of the previous analysis. In a final step, we transpose the performance metric page impressions \(consumer interest\e product attribute price \(coded as low medium and high\ation map to explore the underlying market structure \(see Figure 4      A close look at Figure 4 reveals that the focal product faces two close compet itive products with a similar price \(mid\th at both attract much more consumer interest \(page impressions close competitors priced lower than the focal product as well as one closely competing product with a higher price attracting more consumer interest \(page impressions\tion map indicates price to be a driver of market structure with higher priced products concentrated more towards the upper right and lower priced products concentrated more towards the bottom left      We now compare our proposed methods in regard to their suitability of answering the questions çWho am I competing with?" \(identify competitors\,  çWhich is my closest competitor?é \(rank competitors

competes with whom in my market?é \(identify groups of competitors\What does the market structure look like and what drives it?é \(visualize market structure and its drivers Consideration ranking allows us to precisely identify and rank the closest competing products to our focal product since it is directly derived from the normalized joint consideration matrix. By adding metrics such as consumer interest \(page impressions to the consideration ranking we are able to also evaluate the strength of each competing product However, a joint identificati on of competitors and a visualization of the market structure and its drivers cannot be achieved by consideration ranking Consideration clustering allows for a joint identification of competitors. However, it does not disclose which product is closest to a focal product and in our empirical study truncated the list of competitors of our focal product at one Furthermore, consideration clustering does not visuali ze the underlying market structure and its drivers Consideration mappi ng produces a visual representation of all competing products relative to another. By transposing attributes onto the consideration map, it is possible to explore the drivers of the underlying market structure and of the consideration set composi tion of consumers. Although consideration maps provide a relatively good visual representation of which products compete most strongly, they produce no straight forward ranking or grouping of compe ting products      Figure 5 illustrates that a ll methods tend towards similar results. Most considera tion clusters can also be identified as such in the consideration map and the closest competing product of the focal product is in the same cluster as well as nearest in the competitive map Nevertheless, there are some discrepancies such as clusters 16 and 19, where the consideration map indicates that part of cluster 19 should in fact be in a competitive relationship with cluster 16. Also, the product identified through competitive ranking as being the 3 rd closest competitor to the focal product is depicted as further away in the consideration map than for instance the product ranked 5 th  With each method having its own strengths and weaknesses \(see Table 9.\mbination of all three methods allows for an encompassing understanding the competitive environment    We set out to better understand competitive relationships by analyzi ng big consumer online search data from a price comparison site. We found that price comparison site data is an excellent source for this purpose. It provides revealed measures of consumer search from hundred thousands of consumers every day that spans across entire markets of consumer durable goods and provides several performance metrics \(e.g. clicks, impressions attribute data \(e.g. brand, size\characteristic makes them a highly valuable online data source that is timely and available at low cost Our study extends the existing research stream on competitive analysis and provides new insight into consideration set size and composition of competing consumer durables by using big online search data from a price comparison site as basis for observing

processing and analyzing the consideration set formation of individual consumers across a large number of products spanning an entire market Moreover, we propose and demonstrate the feasibility of three methods that all shed light on slightly different aspects of competition. The implications of using only a single method range from underestimating the potency of a competitive product to identifying the wrong products as being competitors. Managers are therefore well advised to employ a combination of the methods proposed in this articl e if they wish to attain a correct and encompassing un derstanding of the competitive situation faced by their brand and products We must however also recognize several limitations of our study. Fi rst, although all products considered by any given user are captured, repeat page impressions of a single product from the same user will be understated if the user opens a separate browser window for each product and switches between these windows instead of viewing them in sequence within a single window. Second, the formation of consideration sets may not only be driven by product attributes but also by factors that we are unable to observe in our data \(e.g. advertising, word-of-mouth recommendation features \(e.g. çTop 10 also viewed productsé\comparison site could artificially introduce pro ducts to a consumerês consideration set, causing a bi as in our analysis.
