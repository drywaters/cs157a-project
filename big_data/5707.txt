The Application of Semantic-based Classification on Big Data   Mohammed GH. AL Zamil Department of Computer Information Systems Yarmouk University Irbed, Jordan Mohammedz@yu.edu.jo  Samer Samarah Department of Computer Information Systems Yarmouk University Irbed, Jordan Samers@yu.edu.jo    Abstract 227 Sensory networks are scale-free environments that connect entities remotely but with noticeable tendency among its 
participating Sensors. The increasing size of data sets and the lack of algorithmic methods that are effectively manage such huge data collections led to growing demands of new techniques to handle big data\222s side-effects. In this research, a new ontologybased categorization methodology is proposed. The novelty of this research stems for its focus on modularizing the classification task into multi-layer framework to group data in sensory networks. The three-layer framework assumes that large datasets of sensory networks are heterogeneous. Therefore, an ontologylayer could be created to identify semantic interpretation of data 
and semantic relationships with other domains\222 data The goal of this research is to provide a technique that facilitates extracting ontological patterns, which enhance the semantic interpretation of such pool of knowledge. Furthermore the proposed framework facilitates integrating different heterogeneous sources of knowledge into a single one Keywords\227 Big Data Classification; Mining Big Data Classification of Large Datasets I   I NTRODUCTION  One of the most important changes in the twenty-first century that are currently being felt by our societies is the 
profound impact of globalization and information technology huge electronic linkages and interconnections have been created among societies to form networks, which have been developed to connect different entities via virtual links Most sensory networks are scale-free; a set of sensors are connected to a sink that collects timely data and send it to some destination server. While sinks could be considered as a bottleneck entity, self-routing features of sensors minimizes such risk. Therefore, sensory networks produce huge data that need to be managed in terms of access, storage, retrieval, and many other aspects. Such collection is called big data as it is 
accumulating in an exponential rate The natural tendency of entities, within sensory networks permits managing such big data storage using data mining analytical tools. In fact, it is getting more and more difficult to build faster processors. The hardware industry keeps on increasing the number of processors, cores, or graphics card and also invests into improved storage technologies. However all these investments are in vain; if we lack algorithmic methods that are able to efficiently utilize additional processors or memory features This paper presents a framework of applying a modified version of ROLEX-SP classifier [1 Th e  n e w  clas s i f i e r h a s  
been developed to classify data from different domains of knowledge. The idea is to construct three layers for connecting classifiers from different domains semantically. This way, the proposed framework can guarantee abstracting concepts \(class labels\ as representatives of some group of knowledge to create semantic connections among knowledge sources. The advantages of the proposed framework is to facilitate connecting, capturing, and accessing relevant information from large datasets of sensory data as an application of ontologybased classifiers II 
 LITERATURE REVIEW  The term \221Big Data\222 has been first introduced to reflect the daily increasing of data created by different information systems. Last year, a talk by Usama Fayyad [2 pr es en ts s o m e  statistics about internet usage reported by well-known market leaders such as: Google\222s queries, Tweeter\222s tweets, daily Facebook\222 updates, and YouTube\222s views. He showed that the estimated growing of data on the internet is about 40% per year Because Clouds and Smart devices play a significant role in increasing the data storage on the internet and rising new issues and challenges in, identifying new strategies to managing such 
large datasets became more crucial. For instance, J Bughin [3 showed the need to think about new strategies about how to prepare organizations for the challenging of the continuous growth of data warehouses. Thus, resolving big data issues is an essential component of management decision making requires new capabilities, as well as organizational and cultural change 


D. Laney [4 t u d i e d t h e bi g  dat a ph en om en a. H e  concluded some aspects of managing it. The first one is that our existing tools cannot process such volumes as its size continues increasing. The second observation focused on the harmony among data objects; the big data is a collection of heterogeneous data that makes it difficult to analyze. And finally, the researcher observed that obtaining timely data is difficult in terms of accuracy and complexity W. Fan et al [5 usse s the s e th r e e c o nc lusi o n s a n d showed that they demand cost-effective, innovation forms of information processing for enhancing insight understanding and decision making The application of big data solutions takes place in different domains, which makes it an important issue nowadays. For example [6, 7  cu s t om er pe r s on ali z a t i o n in bu s i n e s s  d o m a in  response time in technology domain, DNA analysis in health domain, and many examples in the domain of smart cities The usefulness of mining big data in enhancing life in developing countries has been studied in Re sea r c h e r s  proposed a strategy to come with innovative methods and techniques for analyzing real-time digital data to detect early emerging vulnerabilities, assembling free and open source technology toolkit for analyzing real-time data and sharing hypotheses, and establishing an integrated and dedicated network to conduct an approach at country level Researchers in de scr i b e d t he  m a i n opp or t uni t i e s b i g  da t a  offers to developing countries such as: Early warning, Realtime awareness, and Real-time feedback. The big data mining revolution is not restricted to the industrialized world, as mobiles are spreading in developing countries as well. It is estimated than there are over five billion mobile phones, and that 80% are located in developing countries Finally, researchers in the field of big data analysis benefit from the revolution of open source software. Popular examples of open sources are: Apache Hadoop [10  A p a c h e H a doop related projects   A pa c he S4  12  a nd  S t or m   13  I n bi g  data mining, there are many open source initiatives. The most popular are the following: Apache Mahout  R 15   MO A    V o w p a l W a bb i t  17 P e ga sus 18   a nd G r ap hLa b  19 III  METHODOLOGY  This research illuminates three aspects of big data hetereouginity, volume, and relationship among its contents. In fact, providing solutions to thsese issues will positively affect accessing, managing, and retrieving data from a large sets of information. Figure 1 shows the proposed Design Model Divide-and-Conquer is one of the most usable strategies in computer science for many algorithmic purposes and data managements. The goal of this research is to divide the huge data collection into domain-specific collections and divide the classification task into mainly three layers. The first layer represents homogeneous data that have been collected from a specific domain of knowledge. The second layer abstracts the ontological aspects of the layer below. And finally, the abstract layer \(at the top\ represents the controller part that manages connections among different domains A  Homogeneous Data Layer At this layer, the huge source of data is divided into domain specific sources of knowledge. Clustering of different types of data is widely applicable in data mining tools. The aims of having this level are to minimize ambiguity among heterogeneous data and, therefore, to enhance the accuracy of retrieving relevant information   Figure 1 Layered Cla ssification-Model  Next, every dataset of domain knowledge is attached a classifier. The classifier, in this context, acts as a pointer that classify incoming information \(for example: query\ under one or many knowledge entities. The most important issue that rises during the application of domain specific classifiers is the multi-class classification feature; guarantee that some information might be related to more than one domain of knowledge. Applying this feature might resulted in redundant data storage, but, on the other hand, it enhances the accuracy and performance, and minimizes ambiguity \(False Positives For this purpose, a modified version of ROLEX-SP classifier [1 a s  be en dev e l o p e d i n w h i c h bot h i s s u es w e r e  handles. ROLEX-SP is a domain specific textual classifier that constructs lexical syntactic patterns to increase the accuracy of textual classifiers. Thus, the first layer will consist of a classifier on the top of a homogeneous domain specific subdataset B  Ontology Layer At this layer, a set of relationships and reasoning are kept Ontology is an \223Explicit specification of conceptualization\224 This layer represents a shared vocabulary that distinguishes a domain of knowledge from all other domains. In addition, this layer provides the lower one \(homogeneous data layer\he reasoning about classifying data in some given domain To simplify the implementation, a set of relations has been defined for every domain of sensory data. Such definitions act 


the source of ontology. However, the correctness of the ontology source plays a significant role in producing high performance classifiers Ontology layer facilitates connecting different domains of knowledge as it formally defines these relations. Abstracting this layer facilitates modularity and, therefore, connectivity with other domain knowledge through the application of the control layer at the top of the proposed framework The formal description of connectivity among different domain can be specified as follows: given the facts j i DYDX 002\003\002 where X and Y is related to different domains i, j define the function \265 as a mapping relation between both domains such as          004 265 005\006\006 YXDODO j i where  i DO is the set of representative ontology of the domain i D  In fact, there are many other relations that could be formally described and implemented using ontology-based models Therefore, the learning and training part of classifiers is responsible to handle such relations C  Control Layer \(Access Layer This layer facilitates accessing data by receiving queries or commands, identify relevant domains using the information from ontology layer, and retrieve as accurate as possible information. The process here is bidirectional; the control layer passes commands to the ontology layer and received hits from the ontology layer. The ontology layer passes the relationships of different domains to the below classifier, which, in turn filter out relevant knowledge using information at ontology layer The implementation of the control layer requires standardizing the data storage and structure among all existing domains to ensure the ability of merging results in a good fashion. Also, the control layer might provide variety of services according to the information from bottom layers These services include, but not limited to, displaying classified results, query expansion, and data summarization IV  I MPLEMENTATION  In this section, an explanation is provided for implementing the proposed framework. Figure 2 shows four elementary tasks to implement the three-layer design: 1\ Data analysis and relation enrichment, 2\ Constructing Semantic patterns, 3 aggregating classification patterns, and 4\ Building domain classifiers A  Semantic Features The Application of semantic principles in data mining is done by formulating a set of rules that allows computer programs to make decision by understanding input data. Our proposed framework analyzes a set of input scenarios to extract rules that formulate the semantic features of actions. The entries represent relationships among attributes in a specific category of knowledge [1 S p e c i fi ca l l y   d o m a i ns o f kno w l e dge  are modeled as ontology model that facilitates understanding its role in some given context   Figure 2 Flow diagram of Implementation Tasks  Semantic Features are background information for learners Classifiers\, which reduces ambiguity and expands learner\222s knowledge and understanding. Although, features of domain knowledge complicate the categorization of information in big data warehouses, it provides a valuable source to classify data under its relevant class of knowledge While semantic features are the source of related entities relation module maps attributes with semantic relations. For instance, relation module models relations such as cause-effect transitive-relation, part-of, and many others relations In this research, each category of knowledge is assigned a a set of semantic features and relations for the purpose of classifying incoming data according to the specifications of the classification tool ROLEX-SP [1   B  Semantic Patterns Pattern is a structured representation of features that, when combining all features\222 values, recognizes an instance \(or more\ of data. Thus, we are studying the values of the extracted features to come with a pattern of data that, of course frequently appears in the datasets. A semantic pattern has been proposed in the past to extract relations among concepts such as synonyms, Hearst [20  In  th is r es e ar ch w e u s ed t o ex t r act  Hearst-like patterns to construct rule-based classifiers Semantic patterns are more robust in representing class properties than basic feature since they do not bias toward frequent terms [21 r e su lte d i n f eatu r e im b a lan c e p r o b lem  On  the other hand, semantic patterns are able to represent more than one domain of knowledge in the same pattern just like multi-feature representation. Our hypothesis, in this research, is to measure the capability of semantic patterns to increase the coverage as well as the accuracy of rule-based classifiers and at the same time, reduce classification errors resulted in term and multiple features 


C  Aggregation of Classification Patterns It is normal to produce large number of semantic patterns from a large pool of data. The huge number of generated patterns affects the efficiency of classifiers negatively. Thus there is a need to minimize the total number of representative patterns. For this reason, patterns are aggregated according some features such as: Coverage, transition, conjunction disjunction, and co-existence of patterns Aggregation module is responsible to filter-out redundant patterns. This function plays a significant role in minimizing the complexity of the classification task. On the other hand extracting aggregation rules is not simple; requires intelligent learning algorithms. In this context, big data warehouses provide a rich training set of data. By training data from a specific domain of knowledge, eliciting such relations becomes feasible D  Multi-Classifiers Construction The formulation of the proposed multi-classifiers framework relies on the assumption that heterogeneous data is a combination of different homogonous ones [22   i n o t he r words, a combination of data from different domains According to this assumption, construct a classifier for each domain. Then, find the relationship between classifiers, so that knowledge from different domains could relate to each other The relationship among different classifiers can not be modeled using semantic relations; instead it is an ontology mapping that relates information from different domains This research constructs a set of rule-based classifiers in which each of them consists of a set of association rules to classify sensory data. In addition, an abstract module has been constructed to model the relationships among classifiers themselves. Thus, during classification of data, for example our classifier was able to connect temperature with water volume V  CASE STUDY  Consider the scenario in which a smart irrigation system is seeking for information from different sensors that generates heterogeneous data. Further, consider every sensor has an independent dataset that describes information, facts experiments and much other relevant information. However data managers are intended to add new knowledge, modify existing ones, or even delete expired or wrong facts from each dataset, given that all datasets are kept in a single huge pool i.e. warehouse\ Thus, the collection is heterogeneous as it describes different descriptive information for different sensors One might query for \223water volume\224. According to the design of the layered classification, there would be a classifier for \223temperature\224 that is fully supported by ontologydescription of air temperature, land temperature, humidity, and conductivity. Such information has been extracted using the system described in Figure 3 as a source of relevant knowledge. The water volume classifier will expand the query with related data from different sensors   Figure 3 Automatic Irrigat ion System Architecture  In order to enrich the mining process with useful information about \223water volume\224, the top layer uses the information from ontology layer to connect different sources As a result, it found the relationship between \223water volume\224 and \223temperature\224, for example, which allow computing or predicting future need VI  CONCLUSION  This paper presents a framework to automate multi-layered classification algorithms for the purpose of resolving organization issues of big data collections. The goal of the proposed framework is to facilitate connecting, capturing, and accessing relevant information from large and heterogeneous datasets of sensory data as an application of ontology-based classifiers. Furthermore, descriptions of implementation modules have been provided to reason about the proposed idea The paper presents, too, a case study on detecting relationships among different domains of knowledge to make the proposed framework understandable Future work is planned to experiment this idea, including discovering aspects of heterogeneities from different real-world domains of knowledge, proposing a standard metadata description for structuring heterogeneous datasets, studying the possibility to formally define heterogeneity and its related classifiers, and orthogonal aspects of data

The effectiveness of the phased array is determined by calculating the gain of the transmitting phased array compared to a single element with a receiving RHCP antenna Polarization of the signal is measured by transmitting into a rotating linearly polarized antenna The axial ratio and received signal power is calculated by 002tting an ellipse to j S 21 j measurements taken while rotating the linearly polarized receive antenna Polarization mismatch loss to a circularly polarized antenna is then calculated from these measurements with the following equation where 015 e is the measured axial ratio 021 mismatch  10log 10 050 1  2  015 e  1  015 2 e 051 0503\051 The gain from the phased array is calculated by comparing path loss measurements across an anechoic chamber of a single T/R module with an array of T/R modules The phased array T/R modules are calibrated to a 002xed output power level Therefore quadrupling the number of transmitting modules increases the EIRP of the phased array by 6 dB independent of the antenna gain Additionally a fraction of the phased array power budget is the DC power overhead from the array The phased array path loss measurements are compensated to account for the overhead of the phased array modules and the increased transmit power from multiple active elements This can be calculated as a function of the element power P elem  the total power P tot  and the number of elements N  The following equation describes the correction to path loss applied to anechoic chamber array measurements to compare them with individual element measurements for N elements a total power budget of P tot  and an element overhead of P elem  001P loss  10log 10 050N\051 000 10log 10 050 P tot 000 NP elem  P tot 051 0504\051 For the 4 element phased array prototype with a 5 watt power budget and a 100 mW per-element overhead an additional 6.4 dB of path loss is added to the array measurements when comparing them to the individual element path loss measurements The calculated gain from the phased array is the difference in magnitude between the path loss through the anechoic chamber of a single element and the compensated path loss of the array electrically steered to point at the receiving antenna Test Results Measurements show the four element phased array in a two element by two element planar con\002guration increases antenna gain compared to a single patch antenna element The radiation pattern of the phased array was compared to an expected radiation pattern calculated from measurements of an individual T/R module The expected radiation pattern eliminates the effects of phase quantization and mutual coupling If the measured and expected radiation patterns closely match it would indicate that mutual coupling and quantization effects are minimal Phase shifts for the expected radiation pattern are applied in software to remove any phase quantization effects Other T/R modules were disconnected and detached from the array when measuring the individual element radiation pattern to eliminate mutual coupling Figure 10 shows the array electrically steered to 30 degrees on the azimuth axis and 30 degrees on the elevation Figure 10  Measured and calculated radiation pattern of array with 30 degree azimuth and elevation angle steering Figure 11  Radiation pattern of array and a single element with a 5 W power budget axis compared to a calculated array pattern with the same electrical steering At a 30 degree azimuth and elevation angle mechanical orientation the measured and calculated path losses agree to within 5 dB As expected the main lobe of the phased array radiation pattern is centered near the 30 degree azimuth and elevation angle orientation The difference in the path loss through an anecohic chamber between the phased array and a single element is used to evaluate the performance of the array Figure 11 shows slices of the radiation pattern of a single antenna element compared to the phased array with the array steered broadside and with a 30 degrees azimuth and elevation offset across azimuth and elevation angle mechanical orientations The radiation patterns from the array are compensated for polarization loss and a 100 mW per element overhead with a 5 W power budget using equations 3 and 4 6 


Figure 11 illustrates antenna gain from using the phased array steered broadside and steered with a 30 degrees azimuth and elevation offset When the array is steered broadside and oriented with no azimuth or elevation angle offsets relative to the receive antenna the calculated path loss including array overhead is 3.2 dB lower than the path loss for an individual element with a 5 W power budget Likewise when the array is mechanically oriented with a 30 degree azimuth and 30 degree elevation angle offset the radiation pattern from the array steered to compensate for the orientation has 5.5 dB lower path loss than an individual element Figure 12 computes this gain across azimuth orientations from 60 degrees to 60 degrees and elevation angle offsets of up to 60 degrees See Figure 12 for the calculated array gain relative to a single antenna with the same power budget at 2.485 GHz with a simulated 002xed power budget of 5 W The array gain at broadside and one offset illustrated in Figure 11 are marked in Figure 12 with orange dots The antenna gain measurements are calculated by comparing path loss of single antenna measurements with the path loss of the four element array electrically steered to compensate for mechanical orientation and adjusted for array overhead using Equation 4 This 002gure illustrates the bene\002t to EIRP from using the four element phased array on a satellite with a 002xed power budget across azimuth and elevation orientations of the array The array provides an average of 5 dB gain compared to a single element with a minimum of 2.5 dB at 60 degrees azimuth and 10 degrees elevation angle orientation The degraded performance at high azimuth offsets from broadside could be caused by imperfections in the radiation patterns of the elements The gain at some extreme azimuth and elevation steerings exceeds 6 dB which is the highest expected value from the four element array This is possibly the result of variation between the radiation patterns of individual elements in the array 4 C ONCLUSION This paper presented the design of a four element prototype phased array suitable for CubeSat-scale satellites The array maintains a minimum of 2.5 dB and average of 5 dB in EIRP gain compared to a single omnidirectional element up to 60 degrees from broadside with a 5 W power budget at 2.485 GHz In the average case with a 100 mW per element overhead and 25 PAE ampli\002ers the 4 element phased array consuming only 2 W could match the EIRP of a single antenna system consuming 5 W The prototype T/R modules could scale to 16 elements on a pair of 2U panels with a 10 W power budget Such an array is expected to provide a 11 dB increase in EIRP compared to a system with a single patch antenna and the same power budget despite 1.6 W of DC power overhead from the phased array Phased arrays have the potential to increase the ef\002ciency of CubeSat downlink communication at the expense of mechanical and electrical complexity The current prototype is limited to the electronics mechanical design has been considered only brie\003y Future work could include integrating the prototype with a nanosatellite design with an appropriate feed network and cable routing for the control bus Thermal and vacuum testing of the modules to investigate the robustness of the electronics and array calibration is also needed A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The research was carried out at the University of Alaska Fairbanks College of Engineering and Mines funded in part by the Alaska Space Grant Program R EFERENCES   Tethers Unlimited 223SWIFT Software De\002ned Radios\224 http://www.tethers.com/SpecSheets Brochure  SWIFT  SDR.pdf   Inno\003ight 223Flight-Heritage S-Band CubeSat Radio\224 http://inno\003ight.com/s-band  cubesat  radio   Iwami R.T Bao Jun Lei Lim T Tonaki W.G Chun T.F Zamora A Longhi J.C Watanabe M.K Akagi J.M Shiroma W.A 223Miniaturization challenges for autonomously phased arrays in a CubeSat application,\224 Wireless Information Technology and Systems 050ICWITS\051 2010 IEEE International Conference on  vol no pp.1,4 Aug 28 2010-Sept 3 2010   B Klofas 223A Survey of CubeSat Communication Systems 2009-2012,\224 in CubeSat Developers Workshop April 2013   B Klofas 223A Survey of CubeSat Communication Systems,\224 in CubeSat Developers Conference April 2009   King B 223Lockheed Martin CubeSats Studies\224 http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed data space/documents/tradeshows/smallsat2012 2012%20CubeSat%20Fact%20Sheet  Rev4.pdf   A W Rudge K Milne A D Olver P Knight 223The Handbook of Antenna Design Volume 2\224 1983   Godara L 223The effect of phase-shifter errors on the performance of an antenna-array beamformer,\224 Oceanic Engineering IEEE Journal of  vol.10 no.3 pp.278,284 Jul 1985   Forman B 223Directivity characteristics of scannable planar arrays,\224 Antennas and Propagation IEEE Transactions on  vol.20 no.3 pp.245,252 May 1972   Benhring Pike 223Air Force Test Range Technical Report AF WTR-TR-65-1\224 1965 7

Several previous works propose to improve the efìciency of Xenês Credit CPU scheduler For example proposes a modiìcation to the scheduler that asynchronously assigns each virtual CPU to a physical CPU in order to reduce CPU sleep time Lin et al de v eloped that schedules batch workloads within interactive VMs without compromising the usability of interactive applications The drawback of this system is that it was not designed to run on a cluster Xi et al use techniques from Real-Time scheduling to give stricter deadline guarantees to each virtual machine Other work has looked at avoiding interference between these tasks by careful VM placement 23 or dedicating resources P aragon 7 proposes a heterogeneous and interference-aware data center scheduler The system prefers to assign the applications on the heterogeneous hardware platform that the application can beneìt from and have less interference with the co-scheduled applications MIMP extends our preliminary study to reduce interference through minor changes to Xenês scheduler and then uses the residual resources for big data applications To improve I/O performance Xu et al propose the use of cores that have a much smaller time-slice compared to normal cores reducing the overall IRQ processing latency Cheng et al impro v es I/O performance for Symmetric MultiProcessing VMs by dynamically migrating the interrupts from a preempted VCPU to a running VCPU thereby avoiding interrupt processing delays Our current focus is on shared environments where disk I/O is not the bottleneck for interactive applications but view this as important future work Job scheduling in MapReduce environments has focused on topics like fairness 24 and dynamic cluster sharing among users Bu et al 1 propose a ne w hadoop scheduler based on the existing fair scheduler They present an interference and locality-aware task scheduler for MapReduce in virtual clusters and design a task performance prediction model for an interference-aware policy Morton et al provide a time-based progress indicator for a series of Map Reduce jobs which can be used to predict job completion times Polo et al provide a system to dynamically adjust the number of slots provided for map reduce jobs on each host to maximize the resource utilization of a cluster and to meet the deadline of the jobs 19 decides the appropriate number of slots allocated to map and reduce based on the upper and lower bounds of batch workload completion time obtained from the history of job proìling Our work is distinct from prior work in that we estimate the job completion time of the batch jobs that are running in clusters with unpredictable resource availability due to other foreground applications Previous works 9 12 14 ha v e sho wn heterogeneous cluster designs wherein a core set of dedicated nodes running batch jobs are complemented by residual resources from volunteer nodes or in some cases using spot instances from EC2 The closest w ork to ours is by Clay et al The y present a system that determines the appropriate cluster-size to harness the residual resources

 11    Figure 7: Cost estimated per subsystem \(bar chart on top\of one spacecraft  Small Satellite Cost Model \(SSCM\ based on inputs for a candidate nano-satellite mission \(bottom excel spreadsheet   The SSCM model was then used to calculate the total cost of developing and manufacturing only the first small satellite of mass 10 kg and other specifications listed  Figure 7 The cost calculated for every subsystem and the total cost of $15.08 million in FY 2010 is therefore a function of technological variables like power and pointing and not just mass  To check the sensitivity of technology used to cost we varied some of the input parameters and checked its effect on cost in FY97 $million. Changing the data rate from 10 kbps to 10 MBps to 1 GBps resulted in a cost of $11.35 11.4 and 11.45 million respectively Since COTS products will be used to support the communication link these cost estimates imply that there will be only a 100,000 difference in deploying a radio transmitter 10 kbps\ or deploying an optical transmitter \(1 GBps\ on the 10 kg nano-satellite While previous proposals have certainly supported the availability for laser technologies 50   t h e o p tical d e m o n s tr ati o n s  t h at ar e c u r r en tl y  b ei n g  developed by DLR in Germany and the Aerospace Corporation in the US 51  clea r l y  d e m o n s tr ate  th a t t h e  cost of optical technology is more than that Similarly changing the pointing accuracy from 0.1 0.01 to 0.001 degrees resulted in the cost increasing from FY97 $ 6.45 11.33 and 22.21 million respectively The technology to support 0.1 degrees \(sun sensors\ is different from that to support 0.001 degrees star trackers However current COTS quotations \(e.g. Blue Canyon technologies XACT show that it costs 100,000 for a nanosat star tracker system Integration may cost a few additional thousands but estimating it to 18 million more sounds a bit too much  The SSCM sensitivity study above highlights the need to have cost models that are more sensitive to different technologies and their associated complexities Complexity and risk assessment has been proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the form of their COBRA model  We used the COBRA model in our next study where the methodology and data sets are detailed in \([39   40    5 2     T h e d ata s et r elati v e to  w h ic h  co m p le x ities  ar e  calculated included 120 DoD and NASA missions from after FY89 excluded launch delays or failures and projects with heavy international cooperation. Complexity drivers include  Table 4  column 1 subsystem technical parameters e.g mass power performance technology choices\ and programmatic factors \(e.g., heritage, level of redundancy, foreign partnership  Forty such parameters are considered that are either continuous e.g mass power and represent a range of values bounded by a minimum and maximum, or discrete such as propulsion type \(none, cold gas, monopropellant bipropellant or ion engine\ that represent a finite number of choices    For our smallsat case study, the factors corresponding to spacecraft complexity as they proposed are listed in Table 4 along with the minimum and maximum value that the component takes within their data set The column  candidate nano-satellite which will be a part of a DSM  different 3D angles from the same ground spot as it formation flies in LEO 53  5 4 55    Fo r  ea ch  f ac to r   the complexity of the nanosat is calculated as a percentage of where the data point corresponding to the nanosat lies with respect to the data points for all the other space missions considered. For discrete data, the discrete rank of the data is assessed and then converted into a percentage The average complexity of the proposed nanosat is calculated to be 21.64 


 12  Table 4: Cost estimated for a spacecraft as a function of the relative complexity of its components with respect to components used in previous missions  Based Risk Assessment \(COBRA\ model. Inputs \(Data in Column 3\ are from a candidate nanosatellite mission    The map between complexity percentile and required mission cost and development time for successful missions green triangles is shown in Figure 8  using a green trend line. The missions plotted are among the 120 studied missions and equations are mentioned within the  attempted cheaper than or faster than this model predicts then there is a large probability of failure as highlighted by the red and yellow crosses on Figure 8  Using the above model the estimated cost for our candidate nanosatellite 10 kg mission is 35.824 million and the estimated development time is 35.074 months The high cost is in keeping with the intuition expressed in the data collection section that the cost of LEO small satellites are driven more by technology than mass so the utility of shrinking the satellite should be critically assessed and avoided if the mission technology is very state of art In such cases, micro satellites would win the performance to cost ratio battle    Figure 8: Predicted mission cost and development time as a function of relative mission complexity with respect to other missions evaluated by the Aerospace Corporation [39    4 0     5 2    M is s io n c o m ple x it y  is  a  function of component complexities as calculated in Table 4 The candidate mission is a LEO satellite measuring passive Earth reflectance as part of a DSM  We ran a sensitivity analysis for the COBRA model by varying the deltaV and pointing accuracy required by the candidate satellite It does a great job in predicting the increase in costs from 1 degree to 0.01 or 0.1 degree, by 


 13  estimating a $ 200-250 increase. It overshoots the COTS quotations by a slight margin but is certainly better than the SSCM estimate of  18 million more When the required delta-V is increased from none to 40 m/s to 80 m/s to 120 m/s the respective costs are estimated to be FY97 $ 35.79, 35.82, 35.85 and 35.88 million. Quotations from a 3D cold gas propulsion system printing company called AustinSat revealed that their 1U propulsion unit capable of providing 40 m/s of delta V costs 100,000 with 6DOF thrusters included and would scale almost linearly as more 1U units are added for 40 m/s of more delta-V  The COTS systems therefore cost more than what the COBRA model predicts. The model can thus be improved and made more suitable for COTS-supported small satellites if COTS data and figures were included in the data set to calculate complexity. Since we do not have the data set only the published Figure 8  we could not make the changes  Since many small satellite missions are collaborations between many organizations, the COBRA model could be improved by adding a foreign partnership complexity factor that captures the number of collaborators not just the nationality For example a recent paper 56   formulated a data supported method of capturing international cooperation related complexity using cyclometric  complexity where CGF  0.917  0.0575*CyclometricNumber and CyclometricNumber  f\(nodes, edges, outputs    Figure 9: Cost growth required to support increasing TRL for any component as published in [57    Small satellites are always pushing the boundaries of technology. It is very probable that some of its component values will fall out of range available from past missions In such a case, cost models of TRL transition such as the one shown in Figure 9  57  s h o u ld  b e in co r p o r ated  in to  the COBRA model for the relevant factors Although TRL transition correlates to the spending it does not follow traditional 80-20 rule The COBRA model also does not capture the structural complexity of a small tightly packed satellite which has been theoretically shown to drive development costs. Structural complexity can be quantified using a simple framework shown in Figure 10 35  34   an d  ca n  b e ea s il y  i n tr o d u ce d  i n  t h e COBRA model via a new factor and recalculating the data fit  Capturing the above development costs is important for small satellites whose costs are driven more by technology than by mass. Again, since we do not have the data set \(only the published Figure 8 we could not make the changes   Figure 10 Structural complexity metric introduced and validated in [35  a nd   3 4    5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify three major problems with current cost and risk models that limit their direct application to estimating the costs of DSMs They are the absence of reliable learning curve factors small satellite 20 kg costing tools and operations costing  Existing models and methodologies that may be applicable in part to DSMs have been identified and presented using an extensive literature survey We select ed  some appropriate methods and applied them to estimate the cost of small satellites and small satellite DSMs The exercise helped us point out valuable insights and/or inconsistencies in the results with respect to the data We also suggest methods to modify the models so that they become more suitable for small satellite DSMs  As future work the operations cost model and dynamic complexity of the mission is expected to be captured by a Systems Dynamics Model Re sults from model simulations can provide insight into the effect of design and operation decisions on lifecycle cost and risk expected to improve upon the Monte Carlo results The model results can guide the trade-off of cost with performance and can help in the se lection of a final point design for any given DSM
