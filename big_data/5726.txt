increased attention due to their performance of the global search Genetic Network Programming\(GNP has been proposed in recent years as one of the evolutionary algorithms and applied to data mining successfully because of the prominent representation ability with the compact program derived from the directed graph structure and node reusability of GNP Conventional GNP-based rule mining focused on binary-valued transaction data Therefore Fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining has been proposed to deal with the continuous-valued data types in the real network connection data In this paper 037rstly many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data Then a post-processing method is used to prune class association rules After that a classi\037er is modeled based on the multi-dimensional probability distribution for testing data Experiments on KDDCup1999 data show the substantial improvement of the detection ability of the proposed method 1 INTRODUCTION Abstract mg@asagi.waseda.jp and hirasawa@waseda.jp As the dependence on computers and networks increases in all aspects of lives it is becoming more and more important to protect computers or networks from attacks or hackers Therefore 037rewall which is a prevention-based approach is designed as a part of the computer system or network to permit or deny network transmissions based on a set of rules and other criteria Whereas it is dif\037cult to ensure computers or networks absolutely by the 037rewall In order to give another barrier to defend the computer systems an alternative approach called intrusion detection came out It provides a different notion of security in computer  The objective of intrusion detection is to identify the users hosts or programs who are using the system without authorization or abusing their priviledges under the legitimate access to the system In the last decade Evolutionary Computation\(EC has experienced a tremendous growth in both theoretical analysis and industrial applications Especially recently EC in data mining for extracting comprehensible rules has received increased attention as a promising technique because of its robustness and adaptiveness performing a global search in the space of candidate And its scope has covered a wide variety of computational algorithms and EC w as originally di vided into four branches Evolution Strategy\(ES Evolutionary Programming\(EP Genetic Algorithm\(GA and Genetic Programming\(GP Since EC has simple concept computation capability of self optimization and robustness to dynamic environments EC has been introduced in the 037eld of intrusion detection In GA is used as an unsupervised scheme to provide the level of proximity between the new event and the existing clusters to make the optimal decision proposed a rule evolution approach based on GP for detecting known or novel attacks on the network All of the algorithms applied to intrusion detection can be mainly divided into two categories misuse detection and anomaly detection Misuse detection uses known attacks and attempts to match the current behavior with those attack patterns The main advantage of misuse detection is that it focuses on the analysis of the audit data and typically produces few false results However an inherent drawback of this method is that it cannot detect novel attacks Anomaly detection which uses normal behaviors of network traf\037cs can detect unknown attacks by detecting signi\037cant deviations from the established normal patterns Whereas the disadvantage of detecting previously unknown attacks is paid for in terms of high false positive  Therefore a synthetical intrusion detection is needed which combines the feature of misuse detection that analyzes the known intrusion audit data and the feature of anomaly detection which utilizes normal behaviors A synthetical intrusion detection method is proposed based on Genetic Network Programming\(GNP in GNP is one of the e v olutionary algorithms which is an extension of GA and GP Different from the string structure of GA and tree structure of GP GNP has the directed graph structure which can deal with partially observable processes and the reusability of node Such advantages make GNP use really necessary nodes repeatedly and create compact structures to overcome the bloat problem of GNP-based association rule mining was proposed in which can e xtract rules through its evolution generation by generation without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like methods Basically the proposed method in this paper combines the positive features of misuse and anomaly intrusion deEf\037cient Hybrid Rule Pruning for Intrusion Detection using Multi-Dimensional

 source version. For our system, we used SwiftOWLIM, which has some limitations compared to BigOWLIM. For example, it doesnêt ensure the detection of contradictions   Every OWL ontology has some limitations regarding to the number of triples. The maximum number of triples, in such ontology can be 300-500 millions of triples, depending on the process of inference  Opportunities   Using OWLIM, we make our ontology and our detected association rules public. In this way they become interconnected with other sources from the Internet. Using the REST interface of Sesame, anybody can read or download our ontology. We can do in the same way with other sources from the Internet, we can merge our ontology with other ontologies generating new knowledge. The presented system allows semantic search of the concepts. It represents an open knowledge base   It opens the possibilities for pragmatic web where software agents can search, and even make shopping in the name of a person Threats   Nowadays, there is a relatively small number of companies, which adopt Semantic Web technologies. One reason is that the current systems use relational databases for storing and managing data. Mapping a relational database in an RDF knowledge base may require further works   Ontologies generate heterogeneous knowledge which supports semantic contradictions Semantic Web promotes the principle of AAAé \(Anyone can say Anything About Anything\This means, that anybody can define concepts and relationships between those concepts, according to his/her personal goals This may generate semantic conflicts and contradictions. Any contradiction may produce inconsistencies and will affect the ability of software \(agents, browsers, search engines, etc in the execution of decisions VI  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT  The motivation for this research came from the limitations of traditional recommender systems. Building an effective recommender system is challenging. We believe that ontology is a good solution for modeling product and user data In the presented paper we described how can we use OWLIM custom rule-set in order to eliminate some of the shortcomings of a recommender system based on Apriori algorithm. To manage the product and user data, we applied to OWL ontology, which was uploaded in OWLIM semantic repository, thereby we could improve our system using the facilities offered by OWLIM. We applied to semantic web techniques to obtain an open, public ontology which allows interoperability As a future work, we would like to extend this system to an open recommender system using Linked Data. We can combine the described model with Liked Data. The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the we order to build a standardized system for publishing his data and connecting it to other data sources, we will follow the Linked Data principles w h ic h s p eci fy  h o w  to u s e t h e  different standards together A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research presented in this paper is supported by the Gazepower project \(E-marketing and software quality management based on eye tracking analysis, code 2443/2009 funded by UEFISCSU-CNCSIS through the National Research Program IDEI R EFERENCES  1  L.

We suppose that the user is using service S and he wants to stop it Step 1: Service Cluster Selection Based on the service S, we know the service cluster of S is sc1. The cluster selection list is generated using association rules. Suppose the user selects sc2 as the cluster of next service Step 2: Parameters Initialization This step is pre-processing, in which the parameters of and Q are initialized for ant colony navigation model. Moreover, a time window for frequency is set Step 3: Heuristic Information Calculation The heuristic information ? is evaluated according to the connectedness between S and some feasible services in sc2 Suppose there are n services denoted as S1, S2, . . . , Sn, can be as the next selection from service S, a set of heuristic information {?SS1 , ?SS2 , . . . , ?SSn} is calculated using Eq.\(1 Step 4: Pheromone Trail Intensity Calculation 0 5 10 15 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 The connectedness between the service  i  and service  j   P ij Fig. 3.

Pij variations with the increment of reputationij Based on the attributes of service \(distance, frequency and reputation SS1 , ?SS2 , . . . , ?SSn} is calculated, according to Eqs.\(2-4 Step 5: Probability Calculation and Service Selection In this step the set of probability {PSS1 , PSS2 , . . . , PSSn are calculated on the basic of {?SS1 , ?SS2 , . . . , ?SSn} and SS1 , ?SS2 , . . . , ?SSn} using Eq.\(5 is generated in decreasing order of {PSS1 , PSS2 , . . . , PSSn Suppose that the user selects service S? in the list as the next service he wants Step 6: Updating After the user selects a service S? in the service selection list, the values of three attributes should be updated, including the connectedness between service S and S?, frequencyS and reputationS IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To evaluate the effectiveness of ABSSR, we utilize attributebased service recommendation to test the proposed ant colony navigation model. In the model, the probability in ant colony KB is related to the values of attributes of services Experiment 1: In this experiment, the impact on the probability from different values of the heuristic information ?ij In Eq.\(1 i to j. Without lose of generality, we set Cij from 1 to 15 In addition, in the service cluster of service j, there are four other services as the next service of service i, and they are set randomly between 1 and 15 With the parameters ? = 1 and ? = 8, the probability variation is illustrated in Fig. 3. From the result, with the same pheromone trail intensity, the more Cij is, the higher Pij is Experiment 2: In experiment 2, based on the same heuristic information ?ij, the relationship between Pij and the attributes will be analyzed. The change of attributes will impact on pheromone trail intensity ?ij. In the ABSSR, three attributes are considered: distance, frequency and reputation. If all of the attributes are inconsistent in the experiment, the results are confused. Consequently, we observe one attribute with 


two other remaining attributes be constant. To protect the same order among attributes, we fixed the parameters ? = 10 2500, ? = 1000, ? = 2 and ? = 1 In Fig. 4, the distance between the service i and j is increased from 1 to 5 \(kilometers attributes. From the figure, we can observe that the probability is decreased with the increment of the distanceij, and vice versa. Similarly, we varied the values of the frequencyj and reputationj to analyze the influence of Pij \(frequencyj is from 1 to 50, and reputationj is from 1 to 100 given in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The probability has an increase corresponding to the growths of frequencyj and reputationj V. CONCLUSION As the number of the users of networks has been increased greatly nowadays, the proactive service recommendation in m-commerce becomes an important issue. It is computed by the contextual information from sensor nodes. Although some researchers focus on context history, the attributes of a service have been ignored. In this paper, we have presented an attribute-based scheme for recommending services for consumers. For this end, we grouped all of the given services into several clusters, employed a cluster association model and an ant colony navigation model to track the consumers behaviors, and then calculate the degree of the influences from the attributes of services in relation to the recommendation After these, a service recommendation list is generated for consumers. The proposed models were implemented and the experimental results have shown that the varieties of the attributes do have affects on ranking lists. By refining the system, the proposed scheme could be further analyzed and potentially get its own place in practice REFERENCES 1] Smith, A.D.: Exploring m-commerce in terms of viability, growth and challenges.

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the 


root label in the hierarchies of the ART networks.

Here, GT extracted a much worse hierarchy as shown by CTED being 0.15 higher for GT than for Voting For BoosTexter both HE methods built the same hierarchy and no label was wrongly assigned to the root. All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
