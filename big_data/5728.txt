 As the new-generation distributed computing platform, cloud computing enviro nments offer high efficiency and low cost for data-intensi ve computation in big data applications Cloud resources and services are available in payas-you-go mode, which brings extr aordinary flexibility and costeffectiveness as well as zero inve stment in their own computing infrastructure. However, thes e advantages come at a price people no longer have direct control over their own data. Based on this view, data security b ecomes a major concern in the adoption of cloud computing. Au thenticated Key Exchange \(AKE is essential to a security system that is based on high efficiency 
Abstract 
symmetric-key encryption With virtualization technology being applied, existing key exchange schemes such as Internet Key Exchange \(IKE\ecomes time-consuming when directly deployed into cloud computing environment In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical key exchange scheme, namely Cloud Background Hierarchical Key Exchange \(CBHKE\d on our previous work, CBHKE aims at providing secure and efficient scheduling for cloud computing en vironment. In our new scheme we design a two-phase layer-by-layer iterative key exchange strategy to achieve more efficient AKE without sacrificing the level of data security. Both theoret ical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that when 
deployed in cloud computing environment, efficiency of the proposed scheme is dramatically superior to its predecessors CCBKE and IKE schemes 
I I NTRODUCTION As the new generation computing paradigm, cloud computing has been attracting extensive interest from IT industry and academia in recen t years. One of its core concepts is ëX as a Service XaaS\including Infrastructureas-a-Service \(IaaS as-a-Service \(PaaS\and Software-as-a-Service \(Saa 
Keywords - cloud computing; bi g data; key exchange; efficient security-aware scheduling virtualisation security 
S\ich means that both individual and enterprise users can use IT services in pay-asyou-go fashion. Compared to traditional distributed systems this new concept in cloud computing brings outstanding advantages. First, a considerable amount of investment is saved, for there is no need for users to purchase and maintain their own IT facilities. Second, it brings exceptional elasticity scalability and efficiency for task executions, especially in big data applications 6, 9 Th erefore, u tilisin g clou d to run d ataintensive applications, such as applications in scientific research or social networks, b ecomes a cost-effective choice For example, the Swiss physics research lab CERN [14 
utilised cloud computing to help execute the computation tasks for their particle accelerator which generates 22PB data every year. Until now, there have been several cloud computing projects that provide public cloud computing services for scientific users, for example Nimbus 19  By u tilisin g cloud computing services, the numerous capital investments in building and maintaining a supercomputing or grid computing environment for big data applications can be effectively reduced Despite these advantages, data security concern is still one major obstacle in migrating big data applications to cloud 
computing environments. For example, data in online social systems are highly privacy-sensitive; data used for scientific research often contain private information and/or unpublished results, which make them valuable intellectual properties When submitting tasks to the cloud, people also surrendered control over their valuable data at the same time. The convenience of cloud computing is always accompanied by the risk of data exposure, which is not the case in traditional distributed computing systems where data are stored locally In order to ensure data security against a m alicious third 
party, encryption is a common choice. Fully-homomorphic encryption can save all the trouble of key management, in that it renders the encrypted dataset to be still decrypt-able with the key used for encryption even after any kind of operation has been performed on it. Unfortun ately, to the best of our knowledge, developing a fully-homomorphic encryption algorithm with practically feasible time-complexity still remains an open research problem [12 A s ymmetric-k ey encryption does not require key exchange, but it is way too

time-consuming when employed over large datasets. In order to utilise the much faster symmetric-key encryption Authenticated Key Exchange \(AKE\ scheme is a mandatory requirement -not only for negotiating session keys used in encryption, but also for mutual authentication to deny fake-ID attacks / Man-in-the-Middle \(MITM\s. Reducing time consumption of AKE schemes has hardly been an attractive research problem in the past. However, in cloud computing, at least thousands of virtualised server instances, i.e., virtual machines \(VMs are participating in the execution of almost every task, where the most widely-used Diffie-Hellman \(DH based AKE schemes can become very time consuming When deploying IKE along with the execution of large-scale tasks in cloud environment, it can even take up to 76% of the total time consumed by the security system 22  In this paper, we propose a hierarchical AKE scheme Cloud Background Hierarchical Key Exchange \(CBHKE in the aim of secure and efficient scheduling in cloud computing for large-scale computing tasks such as scientific applications Our work is based on our previously proposed scheme named Cloud Computing Background Key Exchange \(CCBKE and its predecessor, the standardised Internet Key Exchange \(IKE scheme. All these schemes belong to the DH-AKE family The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II discusses related work. Section III provides a motivating example as well as detailed analys is to our research problem Section IV gives the description of our CBHKE scheme in detail based on a series of notations, followed by the analysis of security and efficiency. Sec tion V evaluates the efficiency of our scheme through experimental results. Section VI concludes our work and discusses future work II R ELATED W ORK Nowadays, because of its outstanding cost-effectiveness 10 cloud com p u tin g i s b ein g w i d e ly u tilised  for larg e-scale  computation tasks in big data processing [6 s u c h as scientific research applications [14, 19  G r eat effo rts h av e been placed on cost-efficient scheduling for distributed computing systems including cloud computing [11, 25, 27  The work of Garg et.al [11 and Lee et a l 27 f o c u se d on  efficient scheduling with low energy consumption in cloud computing and distributed systems; Yuan et.al [28 investigated the trade-off between the cost of storage and computing in cloud scheduling. However, none of their work has taken into account the additional cost in enhancing data security which is another important metric of QoS. Tang et.al 25 pro p o s ed a coste ffectiv e security-aw a re sch e dulin g  algorithm for distributed systems. Although their approach achieved high efficiency by grading data security into several levels, their scheme in fact compromised security for higher efficiency, and it still suffered from the inherent costinefficiency of existing KE schemes. The security-aware scheduling scheme for distributed computing systems proposed by Xie et.al [2 s u f fere d fr om sim i l a r pr o b l e m s  Key exchange KE over untrusted communication environment has always been an active research topic in public-key cryptography. In [21, 29 tend ed secu rity standards were formalised and researched for key exchange schemes for the basic 2-party scenario For efficiency, some of the most recent research on authenticated key exchange schemes focused on password-based key exchange [13  which allows two parties to share a session key through exchanging a low-entropy password Many existing key exchange schemes were trying to optimise the multi-partysame-key scenario as we do. For example, some of them focused on the scenario with us ers join and leave dynamically such as [16  K u r o sa wa  20 a n d t h e n Bel l a re et al  7  studied the problem of asymmetric-key encryption in multiuser-different-data scenario with randomness reuse strategy This problem is essentially the same as KE in the background of cloud. Due to the low efficiency of asymmetric-key encryption over large datasets, their schemes cannot be directly applied into cloud computing environments. However the ideas from these schemes inspired our work directly Internet Key Exchange \(IKE   as t h e st anda r d i s ed key  exchange solution has been widely adopted along with IPSec to ensure data confidentiality, integrity and authenticity while data is transferred via Internet Its security has been formally proven 8  th e p a st w e dev e lop ed a k e y ex ch ang e sche m e named CCBKE for security-aware scheduling in cloud computing  en d e p l oyed  in cloud CCBK E invo kes significantly lower time consumption compared to IKE, but it still takes a considerable amount of time. We observed that in CCBKE, the central cloud controller needs to generate keying materials and compute all session keys \(to be used to communicate with ALL virtualised instances later on\by itself and the computational power of intermediate control nodes are not effectively utilised. This is the main motivation of our research in this paper III M OTIVATING E XAMPLE AND P ROBLEM A NALYSIS Big data applications such as scientific applications are always data-intensive and timecritical. Take astrophysics research for example, Austra lian astrophysics researchers operate a gigantic 64-metre Parkes telescope [1 w hich  generates a large amount of data through constant observation In pulsar searching workflow 28 t h e raw ob serv ation  d a ta are generated at a 1GB-per-second ratio. The beam file is generated for later pulsar searching through a local real-time compression operation on the raw data file. During this process, about 1 to 20GB beam file is generated from 4 to 60 minute observation. Scientists usually need to access the results as early as possible, as a late-coming result may cause an enormous waste of resources and loss of scientific discovery. Example in astrophysics is gravitational wave detection [18 w h i ch is especially t i m e critical. Du e to it s  nature of real-time and streaming, delay in returning a result of a task may cause missed detection of an incoming gravitational wave. This will lead to loss of scientific discovery as the next wave would come after years. Moreover thousands of hours of data-intensive computation was in vain which is a terrible waste both economically and environmentally. Online web service is another example

where user requests normally demand serversí response in a few seconds. Hence, efficiency is of extreme importance in cloud scheduling for many big data applications Cloud computing's unique characteristics of virtualisation consolidation and multi-tenancy bring unpredictable challenges to data security. Fo r example a malicious party can easily be another legitimate user who is using the same cloud and has even more advantage for successful malicious behaviours  s d i scu ssed in S ection  I, D a ta in scien t ific  research are valuable intellectual property which can either be peopleís privacy-sensitive inf ormation or directly related to scientific discovery. Therefore we suggest that all user data always stay encrypted in cl oud. Decryptions may only be applied right before data are used for task execution In big data applications, each interaction between users and cloud servers requires key exchange because of encryption As a result a large percentage of time overall is devoted into the security system As demonstrated in [2 e stan d a rd i s ed IKE key exchange scheme can take up to 76% of the total time consumption in the security system \(depending on the actual parameters when the size of user datasets and the number of instances involved are large, which is why we need to improve the efficiency of key exchange schemes In every KE session, a distinct session key is needed for every virtual machine This is because the risk of additional information being exposed against malicious users needs to be minimised. The existence of virtual machine hijacks [2 further intensifies this risk. For example, if a single session key is utilised for data encryption on 100 virtualised instances the information on all 100 nodes will all be exposed when only one of the instances is hijacked and the key is revealed. If we use different keys for di fferent instances, the total information leakage will be reduced by 99 For this reason the computation cost and time consumption of key exchange operations in cloud are more significant than in other distributed computing systems Computations on server instances in key exchange processes can be completed almost instantly. Data communications in KE schemes via networking take almost no time as well because only kilobytes of data need to be transferred between the cloud controller and server instances in order to complete key exchange. Digital signatures are always necessary in key exch ange schemes for identity authentication. In key exchange schemes, messages to be signed are usually of a short fixed length \(typically 128 bits which is the output size of a HM AC function\is regard time consumption in signing and verification of messages is negligible when compared to modular exponentiations over 1024-bit keying materials related to key exchanges. Based on this view, we know that the modular exponentiations in KE operations are acting as the predominant factor in the efficiency for a distributed KE scheme For scheduling purposes, a large-scale cloud computing infrastructure often employs a hi erarchical control structure Following the acronyms defined in the early Eucalyptus cloud system [2 a  t y p i cal cl ou d c o m put i n g st r u c t ure m a y e m ploy a CLC cloud controller as the interface between user and cloud, several CC \(cluster cont rollers\for cluster control, a bunch of NC \(node controllers\ for virtualisation, and then virtualised instances for actual task execution. These are at least three layers for control, and the number of control layers could increase further with the scaling of the cloud environment \(see Figure 1 for an example of a hybrid cloud which is consisted of multiple clouds with multiple control layers\In CCBKE[22 e ed s t o  p e rfo r m a ll th e K E  operations for exchanging a dis tinct key for each instance while the intermediate layers are required to do nothing other than passing the messages In this regard the efficiency of KE will be further improved by re-designing the scheme to distribute the modular exponen tiations to other control nodes Fig.1 An example of a hy brid cloud structure us ed for scientific applications

  where the structure of message for signatures is also an output of similar to IKE. All nodes on   will receive this messa ge, and respond with if signature verification is successful   The reason that only the receiver of and can decrypt them is that, for every parent-child node pair and we already have which concludes phase 1 This phase is for the eventual goal of our scheme ñ KE between CLC and virtualised instances The outcome of Phase 1 will play a vital role here CLC picks its secret value as its keying material for KE with those virtualised instances. CLC encrypts with the session key negotiated in phase 1 and broadcast the following message to the next layer    Upon receiving message from their parentnodes in    the nodes in broadcast similar to their sub-nodes in     because the recipients can obtain by decrypting the received using its For security reasons all nodes in should destroy after sending in Phase 2 where they re-encrypt with and send to their sub-nodes After these operations, once nodes on layer i.e., NCs get to know the value. They now use this secret value to perform a 4-round CCBKE to finish the final KE NC-VM    VM-NC     NC-VM   VM-NC   The final session key for data encryption is where After this step, not only but all virtualised instances will have the desired session key for data encryption/decryption Now all virtualised instances have exchanged a key with their control nodes. For each NC, i.e   they combine and encrypt the final session keys in this format  and send it to its upper level. Then, nodes in every level from compute and send the following message to their parent nodes after receiving from their sub-nodes    After this layer-by-layer action, CLC, i.e will know the session keys that has been negotiated with all virtualised instances, thereby concludes the KE scheme. The task data stored at CLC can now be split, encrypted and distributed to the virtualised instances for execution. After the execution, the server instances may follow an inversed procedure to exchange session keys with CLC and send back the encrypted results The security of our scheme is analysed in Dolev-Yaoís threat model with a bit extension As we are dealing with communication security only, all the data stored on CLC and intermediate control nodes are assumed safe against the adversary in this model. This is a practical assumption because usually the control n odes are not directly exposed to users and the open network environment, which renders them less vulnerable than the processing servers and virtualised instances. The abilities of the adversaries, or attackers, are defined as follows A cloud outside attacker aims to retrieve the session keys in exchange can access intercept or modify any data in transmission, but cannot decrypt any cipher text without the corresponding key or secret keying material; a cloud inside attacker not only has the same ability as but also can be authenticated by the cloud as a legitimate server instance. However has no access to other instances or controllers or any of their secret keys aims to steal data of other users of the same cloud We gave a security proof to CCBKE in d h a d t h e following theorems A cannot retrieve any exchanged session key in CCBKE in polynomial time

Theorem 2 Proofs Lemma 1 Proof 
Assume is the session key negotiated between a and CLC cannot retrieve in polynomial time any session key other than unless a negligible probability in CCBKE See 22 Derived from these theorems, we now have the following lemma  The adversaries defined above have negligible chance of breaking the CBHKE scheme. Specifically, a cloud outside attacker cannot retrieve any session key while a cloud inside attacker cannot retrieve any session key other than her/his own The key exchange procedur es for each node and its sub-nodes in both CBHKE Phase 1 and Phase 2 are actually minimised and iterative CCBKE processes. As CCBKE is secure against cloud inside and outside attackers according to Theorems 1 and 2, all the KE operations in CBHKE scheme are secure against these attackers. Ther efore, all the encrypted messages in our CBHKE scheme are securely encrypted. Hence, we can say that our new CBHKE scheme is secure against attackers from either outside or inside the cloud, defined in  In addition, if we use different parameters and keying materials for every execu tion and re-keying in CBHKE scheme, it will also hold just the same as in CCBKE and IKE As analysed in section II, the majority of time consumption is from modular exponentiations, e.g Compared to them, the symmetric-key encryptions and decryptions in phase 2 take virtually no time because those concat enated keying materials to be encrypted are only several KBs long. Hence, we will analyse the efficiency advantage of our new CBHKE scheme by calculating the total number of modular exponentiations Let be the maximum number of sub-nodes for each node on level Starting from we have then the total number of VM instances is with at most VMs controlled by one NC. Assume the maximum time consumption of one modular exponentiations on one node is then the total time consumption of CCBKE is close to given that VM hold similar computational ability In CBHKE, the upper bound of the total time consumption in KE modular exponentiations in one round should be Given the fact that each NC can launch and control plenty of VMs \(much more than the number of control nodes controlled by a higherlevel control node\e following inequality will hold which is the case of both of our experimental environments Besides, because we have otherwise CBHKE will have the exact same efficiency as CCBKE\we will have if the NCs have similar computational capability that can launch similar amount of VMs. Therefore then we have which means in practical cloud settings, CBHKE always has increased efficiency compared with CCBKE. In fact, in most cases we have then In this case, the time consumption of CBHKE is even only a fraction of CCBKE. Although IKE CBHKE and CCBKE are all of linear time complexity to the scale of the task, the efficiency advantage of CBHKE is nonetheless tremendous V E XPERIMENT AND E VALUATION We conducted our experiments on U-Cloud see Fig 2\ - a cloud computing environment located in University Fig. 2 U-Cloud structure

of Technology, Sydney \(UTS The computing facilities of this system are located in several labs in the Faculty of Engineering and IT, UTS. On top of hardware and Linux OS, We installed KVM Hypervisor [3 w h i ch v i rt u a lises the infrastructure and allows it to provide unified computing and storage resources. Upon virtualised data centres Hadoop [2 i s in stalled to facilitate th e M ap Red u c e programming model and distributed file system. Moreover we installed OpenStack open source cloud platform [5 which is responsible for global management, resource scheduling, task distribution and interaction with users We tested our scheme under two differently structured cloud instantiations of U-Cloud. The first one have 3 control layers and 4 NCs in total, while the second one have 4 control layers and 6 NCs in total. The layouts of the two experimental cloud scenarios are shown in Figure 3 We implemented CBHKE, CCBKE and IKE schemes using C++ with MIRACL[4 c ryp t o g rap h y  lib rary, and ran on our U-Cloud environment. The numbers of instances launched by each NC are On each of the cloud scenario, we repeatedly ran each of the key exchange scheme 20 times to simulate a big computation task with 20 CLC-VM interactions Our experimental results average for 20 runs are shown in Figure 4. The results match the analysis in section IV - E. Through these results we can see that compared to IKE in U-Cloud, the total time consumption of CBHKE in KE is decreased by an aver age of 85.9% and 89.8% in scenarios A and B, respectively. This efficiency advantage of CBHKE when compared to CCBKE in the two scenarios is 70.96% \(max: 75.9%; min: 58.9%\7.85% \(max 82.4%; min: 61.3%\respectively. This is a significant improvement in efficiency without compromising the level of security Also, the results match our efficiency analysis in section IV.E VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we have proposed a novel hierarchical key exchange scheme, namely Cloud Background Hierarchical Key Exchange \(CBHKE\Based on our previous work CBHKE aimed at providing secure and more efficient scheduling for cloud computing environment. In our new scheme we have designed a two-phase layer-by-layer iterative strategy to reduce the overall time consumption in authenticated key exchange \(AKE\ithout sacrificing the level of data security. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results have demonstrated that when deployed in cloud computing environment, the proposed scheme was significantly much more effici ent than its predecessors CCBKE and IKE

Although the efficiency of security-aware scheduling in cloud computing can greatly benefit from an efficient key exchange \(KE\eme such as CBHKE, current encryption algorithms \(even the fastest symmetric-key en cryptions still not fast enough when encrypting large datasets, which is why currently another large research community is focusing on another way around -to reduce encryption usage. Research on an efficient and secure encryption algorithm for cloud and other large-scale distributed computing systems is still an open research problem A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research work is partly supported by Australian Research Council under Linkage Project LP0990393 R EFERENCES

across all Secretaries. This is particularly interesting in Secretary Riceês case since her previous statements include conducting foreign policy based on the national interest, and not the international community Some of the more interesting findings come from what is unique about each Secretaries important keywords and phrases. For instance, Secretary Albright has and as two of her most important phrases however these words are not found in Secretary Riceês important phrases. This could be a conscious effort by Secretary Rice to not use after it was found that Iraq never had them. There is also a commonality between Secretary Albright and Secretary Rice in that they share in their important phrases. This supports the fact that the Iraqi nation and its former leader was a key point in foreign policy from as early as 1997 up until 2005, a span of at least eight years Secretary Rice also has some of the most politically charged keywords and phrases, more so than Secretaries Albright and C linton. Three of Secretary Riceês keywords are Democracy, Political, and Democratic. This could show that she felt a very politically motivated purpose to foreign policy Another unique finding from the Rice dataset is that the Soviet Union is one of the important phrases for Secretary Rice. Since the S oviet Union collapsed in 1990, it is interesting this phrase comes up most frequently, and within a high percentage of her speeches. Further keyword in context analysis should lead to more explanations for the appearance of this phrase so frequently is another unique keyword for Secretary Rice as well, denoting an open mind towards dialogue and communication within her foreign policy messages Secretary Clinton separates herself from the previous female Secretaries of State as well. She is the only Secretary with keywords of and denoting a difference in how she views her position from the others. Future is an interesting keyword; it could note that she sees foreign policy as being a l ong-term investment, or that the United States should be more forward looking in their foreign policy initiatives. Or she wants to convey to other nations that the US is thinking about the future, and not staying in the present. Progress is also interesting. It is a word that can carry a negative connotation for some people within the United States, such as conservatives However, again keeping in mind the Secretary of State is usually speaking to a foreign audience, she could be lauding foreign publics for their progress, or pushing foreign countries to make more progress democratically, or within the human rights realm Finally, she is the only Secretary to use Economic as well. This could be a product of our times, when most of the world is embroiled in economic recessions; it could also note the ever-increasing globalization of the worldês economic ties and its shared ups and downs. Secretary Clinton and Secretary Albright share the keyword with each other, while this is not part of Secretary Riceês keywords. This could be confirming Jeffreys-Jonesês statement that women tend to be more pacifists, but Rice would not fit within the mold since Peace was not within her keywords. It could have to do with ideological differences between Democrat and Republican administrations, or it could be due to the fact that Secretary Rice was trying to manage public opinion on the two ongoing wars in the Middle East Afghanistan and Iraq. Mentioning might be seen as hypocritical while being involved in two conflicts. Secretaries Albri ght and Clinton also share as a common phrase while Secretary Rice does not. This might be a conscious decision since many foreign populati ons saw the invasion of Iraq as unlawful, and Secret ary Rice did not want to court controversy Finally, Secretary Albrightês dataset had the least amount of speeches, but it still provides insight into her unique themes is the only keyword unique to Secretary Albright, wh ich could possibly denote a pension for speaking the tr uth, or only imparting what is fact-based and not opinion based on her part She does have unique phrases though, including and Although currently most people would pair Weapons of Mass Destruction with a Secretary of State from the Bush administration, it was Secr etary Albright who used the terminology most often Secretary Albrightês use of the phrase Chairman Arafat is also telling, it shows that the Palestinian conflict was given much higher priority during the late 1990ês then it has been today Palestine or any of its conjugations does not appear on either Secretary Clint onês or Secretary Riceês important keywords or phrases. This conflict has given way to Iraq and Afghanistan Also interesting from the findings is there are no keywords or phrases relati ng to women, girls, or womenês rights as a foreign policy initiative Although Secretary Albright discussed her wish to make a difference in the lives of women and girls across the developing world within her article in the SAIS Review, our findings are not consistent. None of the female secretaries had an important keyword or phrase relating to females leading us to believe that while women and girls might be an important

and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US foreign policy  This paper has multiple limitations on its research. The datasets included are only for the three most recent female Secretar ies of State and cannot be used to generalize an overall US foreign policy message. Also, there is a gap between the three female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary Powell was not included Another limitation is the lack of keyword in context analysis. Although these keywords and phrases are important due to their number of times used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of these important keywords and phrases will lead to deeper insights and more complex nuances  This study is an initial analysis on three separate datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to deeper understandings of the frequently occurring keywords and phrases that are predominant from each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will provide further unpacking a nd clearer definitions of what each keyword or phrase means when the Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and geography. This analysis will be completed on Secretary Rice and Secretary Albrightês datasets as well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powellês tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes are consistent with those before and after his term Future research will also include the final two approaches from the ASSANA Methodology traditional hand coding as well as the High Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating these other approaches will allow for a full review of the differences in findings and time for analysis between each approach
