A brief overview of the ethical and technical challenges is provided with consideration of the ability to generalise across a range of medical conditions Finally the paper closes with conclusions and directions for future research II D EMENTIA Dementia is a degenerative conditio a n d is a progressive cognitive disabling disease which effects around 5% of people over 65 and in excess of 40% of people aged over 90. Dementia is one of the main causes of disability later in life, ahead of cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke Typical symptoms include: \(1\ memory loss, \(2\ speech impediments, \(3\eteriorating thought processes, and \(4 impaired perception and reasoning [5   A d d iti on al ly  ch an g es  in personality, behaviour, and mood, which include: depressive symptoms, apathy, agitation, and aggression [5   Alzheimerís disease \(AD\is a leading cause of dementia and characterised by progress ive cognitive impairment with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anomalous motor behaviour, depression, anxiety weight loss, irritability and agitation. The stages dementia ha ve been modelled in [6 b a s e d  on the BPSD [2 T h e B P SD ha s g a i n ed ac ce pt a n ce fro m health care practitioners and in computer science research seminal work being conducted by, for example, CohenMansfield see [6 A 7 tiered conceptual model o u t  a gra p hi c a l  representation of BPSD in whic h patients with dementia are classified according to the severi ty of symptoms and their need for different levels of health care services, the seven tiered model is constructed as shown below. The prevalence percentages \(%\ are estimates; for tier 7 prevalence is the estimated percentage \(%\ people with dementia who fall into this category and for tiers 5 and 6 estimates are based on clinical observations in, for example, [7 Tier 1: No dementia. Management: universal prevention, although specific strategies to prevent dementia remain unproven Tier 2: Dementia with no BPSD. Prevalence 40 Management: by selective prevention, though preventive or delaying inte rventions \(not widely researched Tier 3: Dementia with mild BPSD ñ e.g., night time disturbance, wandering, mild depression, apathy repetitive questioning, shadowing. Prevalence 30 Management: by primary care workers Tier 4: Dementia with moderate BPSD ñ e.g., major depression, verbal aggression, psychoses, sexual inhibition, wandering. Prevalence 20%. Management by specialist consultant in primary care Tier 5: Dementia with severe BPS ñ e.g., severe depression, psychoses, screaming, severe agitation Prevalence 10%Management: in dementia specific nursing homes or by case management under a specialist team Tier 6: Dementia with very severe BPSD ñ e.g physical aggression, severe depression, suicidal tendencies. Prevalence 1%. Management: in psychogeriatric or neurobehavioral units Tier 7: Dementia with extreme BPSD ñ e.g., physical violence. Prevalence rare Management: in intensive specialist care unit The 7 tiers point to clear demarcations between stages however in practice the demarcations are essentially fuzzy as we shall show In considering this can be managed by regular consultations with healthcare professionals where diagnosis and management can implemented however while management of the condition at this level can be achieved specific strategies to prevent dementia remain unclear [5  and require institutionalisation and retention of a domestic living arrangement using IAL strategies is impractical and potentially dangerous for both patients and carers is more problematic as management [of the patient m a y b e in d em entia sp e c if ic nursing ho m e s or  by case management under a specialist team Thus, for patients the spectrum of BPSD severity varies; as such there may be patients within who display symptoms and behaviours closely related to behaviours who may be capable of remaining in a domestic environment while monitored. For a patient classified as IAL is patient specific and whilst there may be a case made for retention of IAL arrangement the likelihood is that institutional care is the sensible option. In considering  and the statusí\(s classified under these tiers offer the optimal scope for retention of IAL supported by 24/7 remote monitoring using sensor technologies with mobile technologies Based on this analysis retention of IAL for domestic settings can be restricted to and with possible p atients displaying behaviours closely related to tier 4 patients as set out in the 7 tier model. This conclusion is supported by the observations in  f r o m a d e m e ntia m a na ge me nt perspective the estimated prev alence of BPSD in dementia patients in specific tiers is: 40% for 30% for 20 for 10% for and 1% for The incidence in is noted as ërareí. In practice the clear demarcation between the tiers is not realis tic as the boundaries are fuzzy however the conclusions drawn from the analysis re main valid From this analysis it can be seen that the manageable tiers from an IAL perspective \(tiers 2, 3, and 4\ represent 90% of the population of patients with dementia and retention of IAL for these cases \(plus the identif ied cases in tier 5\ent opportunities to improve the QoL for patients and carers while realising significant financial savi ngs for all stakeholders in the management of ADRD and dementia

There is a large body of documented research addressing Alzheimer type conditions in general and dementia in particul 7 8  t h e li t e ra t u re  r e vie w e d ha s foc u sed  o n  agitation and aggression as these behaviors relate to dementia Agitated behavior is one of the most frequent reasons that patients with dementia are placed in long-term care settings These behaviors are indicators of distress and are associated with increased risk of injury to the patients and their caregivers 9 Bis w as  10 ha ve no ted tha t Agita t e d b e ha vi or is  common in patients with dementia and represents a challenge for all stakeholders in dementia management. There is a consensus in the lite rature that for dementia agitation and aggression represent not only a serious problem but is also frequently a tangible manifestation of other negative behavioral issues III T HE P RECURSORS TO THE O NSET OF A GITATION The symptoms and behaviors identified as they relate to BPSD are addressed in [4 d ar e c l as s i f i ed u n d e r 6  neuropsychiatric symptoms: \(1\anomalous motor behaviour 2\depression, \(3\xiety, \(4\eight loss, \(5\irritability, and 6\itation. These classifications provide realistic headings under which the precursors to manifestation of the BPSD can be modelled for use in implementing IAL Firstly, symptoms of dementia which Pugh 4 consider are not amenable to monitoring in smart and assisted living environments. These symp toms relate to depressive states; we would argue that the monitoring of such states is possible as discussed by Peng  the r ef ore w e w ill  include the precursors to depr essive states in the list of precursors discussed in this paper. The 6 neuropsychiatric symptoms re p r es en t cl as s i f i cati o n s  of p r e c u r s o rs w h ich  ar e  potentially amenable to automa ted sensor-based monitoring in IAL if suitable non-invasive sensor-based monitoring and data capture in a machine processable formalism can be identified and implemented. This is discu ssed in subsequent sections of this paper Anomalous motor behavior \(AMB\can be viewed as physical movement including location-based behaviours such as wandering and unusual movements in space and time excessive movement is addressed in the following section Additionally, verbal behaviours can be viewed as motor behaviours. Such behaviours are amenable to monitoring using a range of sensor technologies including blind video monitoring, and non-medical grade sensors Changes in a dementia patients weight \(generally weight loss however weight gain may be an indicative factor\s a significant precursor of dements behaviour driven by: failure to eat a good diet \(often patients forget to eat a prepared meal\ or AMB in terms of either excessive movement \(a precursor of agitation, aggression, mania, or general restlessness\ or alternatively too little movement which may be an indicator of a depressive state which has a reported frequency in a patient population of 80% in the BPSD scale [2 7   Two potential sensing approaches are possible: \(1\ regular weighing using smart scales, and \(2\ensor technologies to measure the levels of movement. Research conducted by James Levine 1  ad d r es s es th e m eas u r em en t of m o v em en t as it  relates to obesity. Whereas in dementia the measurement generally\lates to excessive motor behaviour \(i.e., weight loss is an indicator\ Levine targets the lack of exercise resulting in weight gain Notwithstanding the differing focus of the research the approach adopted by Levine may be useful in monitoring the motor behaviours in dementia patients \(both for weigh loss and weight gain\ In their original work the energy generated by sensors located in clothing was intended to measure a lack of exercise; the converse can be applied to dementia patients to measure excessive exercise This is perhaps the most important category of demented behaviour is agitation; irritability and anxiety are arguably related to agitation and may share many of the symptoms. Such symptoms and behaviours have been shown to lead to aggression which is an issue for patients and carers alike Agitation, anxiety, and irritability may be monitored using blind video monitoring and non-medical grade sensors; there is however a potential need to include physiological measurements such as [1   Galv an i c Sk in R es p on s e  GS R   Blood Volume Pressure \(BVP\, Heart Beat \(HB\ respiration EEG, ECG, etc IV I MPLEMENTING INDEPENDENT ASSISTED LIVING Having considered the relevant metrics that relate to agitation and aggression in dementia and identified the precursors \(data points in computational terms\o the onset of agitation and aggression we now turn to the challenge of implementing IAL using the precursors to trigger graduated interventions. From a practical perspective implementation of IAL essentially relies on three components The data structure used for and storage of data \(contextual information Data capture using sensor networks realized using smart spacesí with wireless networked and / or mobile communication technologies with interfac es to the software \(context middleware\ining the appropriate data types and format Context middleware to process the captured contextual information \(sensor derived da ta\ith visualization in an appropriate format Identifying the precursors demands the modelling of the domain of interest \(context modelling\; this has been addressed in 15 w he r e O OBM\s been identified as the optimal approach. OBM provides a generic non-hierarchical, and readily extensible structure capable of adaptation to suit the domain sp ecific nature of context with

the capability to define the me tadata, the context properties and the literal values used in the context-matching process Additionally, while the approach discussed in this paper does not currently use inference and reasoning \(which generally applies subsumption and entailment\BM facilitates this where required Context modelling is designed to enable the mapping of context properties and their literal values with a comparative analysis of data points \(such as environmental parameters proximate information \(social parameters\, and motion \(spatiotemporal parameters\otion is reflected in movement and position \(e.g., vertical or horizontal\ space and time. OBM implemented using Semantic We b technologies \(e.g., OWL  im p l e m e n ted using the Je na API  1 7  pro v ide s the b a sis upon which data storage with accessing and updating to be used in the comparative analyses In considering dementia the modelling of BPSD has been investigations by Hurley 18 hav e  r e sulte d in  the development of the SOAPD ontology. A number of implementations of systems designed to model dementia use the SOAPD ontology including [19 to  e n ab le t h e  d e ve lo p m e n t of sophisticated systems that facilitates caregiving and clinical assessment of dementia patient s. The SOAPD ontology [18  addresses the domain specific BPSD parameters thus enabling the implementation of current states \(contexts\ with updating over time in ëreal-timeí with ëB ig Dataí solutions as discussed in this paper The nature of the data required to identify and measure the data points \(the precursors\relate to the 6 neuropsychiatric symptoms identified in [4 It  is appar e nt  f r o m  the d i scussi o n  on precursors and symptoms that progression of dementia through the seven tiers is characterised by significant changes in behaviour. The most appropriate changes for use with sensing appear to be based around location, motion and sound For instance, in terms of sound, it is possible to diagnose conditions such as Parkinson's Disease through an analysis of spoken words, even in the early stages \(see e.g www.parkinsonsvoice.org\gure 1 shows an [android ap p  designed to monitor trembling in Parkinsonís patients, this has a synergy with dementia where monitoring of a patients dynamic and changing ëstateí is the aim Fig. 1 Measuring hand trembling using an Android smartphone Sound can also be used as part of systems for emotion recognition as discussed in this m a y he lp t o  info rm diagnosis at Tier 3 and above. More significant verbal outbursts above Tier 3 \(and even repetition at lower tiers\ are obvious candidates for use of microphone-based sensors which, especially when worn on the body, need not provide any privacy concerns as actual voice data need not be recorded It is also apparent that pitch and amplitude data, from microphones, can provide significant monitoring data in the detection of verbal aggression and screaming in tiers 4 and above In considering motion, monitoring behaviour changes through video is likely to be considered highly intrusive although to a reducing extent as a patient moves toward the higher tiers. So, in Tiers 6 and 7, where violence \(to oneself and others\ real risk, it is lik ely to be an expected form of monitoring \(e.g. CCTV in a care home\erefore, it is that perception of intrusion that is lik ely to, at least in part, dictate the sensing techniques that can be used. So, where computer vision is considered appropriate it also has the advantage of being able to provide more information than simple motionrelated data. For instance, a significant problem in older people is ensuring adequate nutrition, especially where patients may forget to eat. In that scenario, CCTV can be used to monitor body-mass changes [2  Shadow data from cameras is lik ely to be more appropriate for lower tiers, however, where systems such as those of [2  can provide information on gait using the Microsoft Kinect sensor. For both CCTV and shadow data, it is possible to detect the problem of wandering \(e.g. Tier 3/4 and above\ and unattended exit, the Kinect in particular having the advantage of simpler three-dimensional location estimation. Similarly location-contexts are likely to provide significant behaviour data and can be measured also through proximity switches and radio-module signal strength measurement \(e.g. Bluetooth WiFi, Zigbee, and suchlike\. In some contexts night-time wandering can be dangerous, and so monitoring systems such as those discussed in [2 ca n h e l p r e du ce ri s k  It h a s  be en  suggested that temperature perception alters for dementia sufferers, and associated discontent can be expressed through problematic behaviou  Also   a n a l y s is o f l i ght le v e ls a nd spectral components within a care environment can provide useful clues in terms of sleep problems, see e  I t is  therefore possible that monitoring of dementia sufferers environment, comfort level and any adjustments they make to heating/cooling controls, could add to longitudinal data for diagnosis. In fact, a wide variety of links have been suggested between environment sensor data and medical conditions such as dementia, a fuller discussion being available in   Finally, it should be noted that many of the above factors can be monitored through Smartphone use, as well as static and body-mounted monitoring systems. Smartphones are likely to be used by sufferers through many tiers of dementia, and include sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and microphones suitable for event detection and longitudinal data collection. For carers and clinicians they can also be used for logging of symptoms, problematic-events and emotion data that can enhance longitudinal analysis of sensor data \(i.e humans as sensors into their own, and others, states

V D ATA P ROCESSING The processing of the captured data into useful information can be viewed under two headings: \(1\ in ëreal-timeí data processing in e-health monitoring, and \(2\ the processing of data in ëbig-dataí solutions in which data is mining is applied to realise long-term prognoses The goal of ëreal-timeí data processing in a health monitoring scenario is to measure a patients current state at time {t0} and the changed state a time {t1} \(the time intervals between {t0} and {t1 Ö tn} will be defined by the clinician and will be patient and condition dependent\The current Smartphone offers the prospect of implementing local data processing with decision support thus enabling remote health monitoring. Health monitoring clearly involved a very large volume of data The requirement in ëreal-timeí health monitoring is for health monitoring applications which can run on low-powered devices \(such as high-end mobile phones\and can process the sensor derived data to reach instant decisions relating to a patients dynamic state at times {t0 .. tn}. Ideally, health monitoring systems will only communicate current patients state if there is an issue or pr oblem \(see the brief illustrative scenario later in this article\. Where there is no change the system will not react. Clearly there is a requirement for any number of reasons for the patient monitoring information to be sent at periodic intervals for logging and possibly further analysis. The intervals at which such uploading of the collected data is made is again a clinical decision. The analysis of the data from multiple patients can be viewed as a big-data challenge Big-Dataí \(it has been observed that the term is a ëbuzzwordí and has formerly been known as data mining amongst other similar terms\relates to a scenario in which very large volumes of data are gathered and processed to identify \(in the case of health monitoring system s\ends in the data and potential prognoses based on the data collected and results obtained from multiple patients. Clearly, big-data solutions require massive data storage and computing power \(as opposed to the ëreal-timeí data processing\ An exemplar of a big-data analysis can be seen in the brie f illustrative scenario later in this paper Central in the proposed approach to data processing is the processing of captured data \(contextual information\; the posited approach uses a CPA  w h ic h p r o v ide s a  ba sis upo n w h ic h c o nte x tua l  info r m a t i o n  can be processed while with constraint satisfaction and decision support \(an essential consideration in, for example, health monitoring wh ich whilst arguably fuzzy in nature must result in clearly defined decisions relating to a patients current and changing state / prognosis The CPA is predicated on the ECA\ rules concept, the <condition> component employing the IF-THEN logic structure [1 w h ich relat e s t o the n o ti o n o f   where the IF component evaluates the rule  resulting in an The <ac ion> in the proposed approach can be either: \(1\ a Boolean decision, or \(2 the firing of another rule Essentially, the context-matchi ng process is one of reaching a Boolean decision as to the suitability of a specific individual based on context [1 i ve n that a p e r f e c t m a tc h is high ly unlikely the CM algorithm must accommodate the PM issue along with a number of related issues as discussed in [1  In  CM the probability of a perfect match is remote therefore PM\ must be accommodated. To address the PM issue the CPA applies the principles identified in fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets with a defi ned membership function which is predicated of the use of decision boundary\(s\ \(thresholds 26  as  dis c u s s e d in  1 4  Th e m e m b ers h ip f u n c tion p r ov i d es  an effective basis upon which pr edictable decision support can be realized using both single and multiple thresholds to increase the granularity of the autonomous decision making process Conventional logic is generally characterized using notions based on a clear numerical bound \(the crisp case\e., an element is \(or alternatively is not\ defined as a member of a set in binary terms according to a bivalent condition expressed as numerical parameters {1, 0 F u z z y s e t t h e o r y e n ab les a continuous measure of membership of a set based on normalized values in the ra nge [0.0Ö1.0  t h e s e m a p p ing  assumptions are central to the CPA [14  T h e pro c e s s i ng o f  contextual information in context-aware systems imposes issues similar to those encountered in decision support under uncertainty, which is possibly th e most important category of decision problem [28 a nd r e p r e s e n ts a  funda m e nta l issue fo r decision-support In summary, the CPA provides a basis upon which decisions under uncertainty with high levels of predictability can be realised. A discussion on the CPA, rule strategies, and the related conditional relationships for intelligent contextaware systems with example implementations and a dataset evaluation can be found in   VI A PPLYING I NDEPENDENT ASSISTED LIVING We have considered the issue of an aging population and the prevalence of Alzheimer type conditions including dementia. IAL has been introduced with health monitoring and data processing. While health monitoring offers exciting potential opportunities across a range of medical conditions to improve QoL \(for patients and also importantly carers\and realize efficiencies \(resource utilization and financial savings there are issues which must be addressed including technical and ethical constraints There are technical challenges im plicit in health monitoring including data processing as discussed in section V and 3   Ho w e ve r w e a r g u e in 3 that w h ile the princ i p a l  challenges in the development of sensor technologies have been addressed as discussed in [3 e r e  r e m a ins th e issu e  o f  developing non-invasive health monitoring based on sensor networks.

Anonymisation is discussed. In considering sensor technologies the work of Peng as documented [11  is  interesting in that it captures EE G data to address the cognitive issue of depression. Data is collected using sensors applied to the scalp which is ërelativelyí non-invasive. However a truly non-invasive sensor technology requires at least non-intrusive sensor-based data capture. Currently addressing the issues briefly introduced represents a challenge and remains an open research question Ethical issues in medical research and clinical practice are not new [3   h o w e v e r P r o v i d ing hea lth m o nitor i ng always entails patient consent along with ethical issues identified in section VI Alzheimer type conditions which include dementia are characteri zed by cognitive degeneration An issue in diagnosis \(particularly in the early stages of dementia\ifferentiating be tween general ageing with its natural cognitive consequences and a patient with dementia This may be simple in younger patients \(dementia may be prevalent at 45 years of age\ but a patients age diagnosis becomes progressively more difficult. We have discussed the stages of the development of dementia in section II and have related the stages of dementia to the 7 tier model. A discussion around the ethical and consent issues are beyond the scope of this paper however this is addressed in [3 w h e r e  the majority of ethical principles implicated in assessing a patientís ability to consent to treatmentî are reviewed In considering the 7 tier model developed by Vickland and Brodaty as discussed in [6 in th e ea rly s t ag es  of t h e  development of dementia \(i.e patients are arguably capable of granting informed consent however in later stages this will not be the case wh ere institutionalisation in to is essential if only to protect the patient with advanced dementia from self inflicted inju ry. In the advanced stages of dementia \(and probably other similar health conditions where cognitive issues predominate informed consent may not be applicable and family members w ith clinicians ma y be required to arrive at ethical choices related to the fact of monitoring and the nature of such monitori ng along with the degree of invasiveness as we have briefly introduced in section VI  Informed consent is a fundamental ethical concern for both research and clinical application in translational research [3   as observed in nt ra l issue s l i e in ho w t o a p a t i e nt with dementia \(or in fact any patient not of sound mind who may benefit from e-health monito ring\ has the ability to grant informed consent. Clearly, where there are family members who are carers permission may be obtained from this source however many patients with demen tia have no relatives able to grant such consents. Addressing ethical and consent issues represents a major challenge in both research and clinical practice This paper has focused on e-health monitoring for patients with ADRD and dementia however the technologies discussed are arguably transferable Context and therefore e-Health monitoring are patient and condition specific; as such given that the correct data contextual information\an be captured and processed the technologies introduces in this paper may be utilized across a range of conditions ranging from care for the elderly as we have discussed through patients with dementia, patients suffering from depression, to recuperating patients requiring post operative care at home \(thus achieving the early release hospital beds with improvements in patientsí QoL Thus it can be seen that the fundamental technologies discussed in this paper form a basis for both the monitoring of patients with dementia and other conditions requiring intelligent monitoring in decision-support systems VII C ONCLUSION This paper has introduced the background and motivation for the growing concern regardi ng Alzheimer type conditions in general and dementia in particular. The BPSD has been discussed and the 7 tier model [6 ha s b e e n pr e s e n ted with  conclusions drawn on the appropriate stages of dementia which can be addressed using health mo nitoring techniques in IAL in a computerized system. The overall conclusions are that behaviors tiers 2, 3, 4, and possibly 5 may be monitored in IAL with the aim of enabling a demented patient to remain in a domestic environment for longer w ith benefits for the patients QoL, family, the healthcare system, and the wider society Consideration has been given to the precursors to the detection of the onset of agitat ion and aggression in patients with dementia along with referenc es to sensor technologies. In data intensive context-aware systems the basic component technologies exist are all currently available and widely researched. Such technologies include: mobile systems and the related infrastructures, sensor s, smart appliances, wireless mesh architectures, cloud services, and data brokerage/processing While there is a need for the development of non-invasive sensor technologies \(as identified in this paper\ the basic sensor and communications technologies are generally well developed 29   N o tw ith s t an din g th e eth i cal  is s u es a rg u ab l y  a res ea r ch  topic in its own right\und informed consent as introduced in section VI the principal challenges lie in the development of intelligent context-aware systems software capable of processing the sensor derived data in context-aware decisionsupport systems capable of implementing enhanced levels of computational intelligence Health monitoring for patients with dementia has been discussed and agitation and aggression identified as a major problem.

While the research discussed in this paper has begun to resolve a number of issues relating to the processing of contextual information, includ ing potentially the data that relates to emotional response, a number of challenges identified remain as open research questions. Such questions relate to The identification of the data \(knowledge\ that identifies emotional responses The development of a [non-invasive p p r oa ch  t o dat a  capture including approaches to video monitoring of patients in a range of settings using ëblindí camera technologies with effective data Anonymisation. While potential solutions may include the Microsoft Kinect technologies as discussed in tua l  implementation remains an open research question The development of a suitable Semiotic grammar and valence measurement system for emotion Representing the knowledge \(data\ in a suitable data structure.

 Lecture 4.3 INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        9    signals including high-speed digital waveforms. Unlike high-end oscilloscopes, ATE usually does not have CDR capability integrated into the hardware. While a waveform sampler performs under-sampling of the test signal, the captured waveform is influenced by slow jitter. The purpose of this work is to remove slow jitter effects such as SSC in a high-speed digital signal and restore a fine waveform and eye pattern. The test signal is a PRBS bit stream. Slow jitter reduction is realized by post processing whose steps are  PRBS becomes extremely wideband multi-tone  Jitter is PM onto each tone  Original tones can be recovered by Equation \(11 which is constructed by the modulation signal e measured signal \(cos  d its orthogonal signal sin    Each modulated tone is extracted as a group and demodulated by the ODM, recovering the modulation signal   The sin  is generated by 90 degree rotation from the cos  The FFT & IFFT method takes care of this processing  Recovered tones are equalized power-wise to their original modulated state  CWR by the factor of Nx reconstructs a PRBS waveform  A second CWR by the factor of the number of bits eg. 127\onstructs an eye pattern Finally the developped processing procedure succeeded to reconstruct clear refined PRBS waveforms and wide open eye patterns. The key in the processing is that Equation 11\ is derived as a relatively simple combination of acceptable processing components. This paper mainly discussed an example of a 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS signal containing a jitter of 5kHz. The waveform sampler employed in the experiment has an actual sampling rate of 110 Msps and the ABW of 10 GHz. Reduction of slow jitter and SSC is demonstrated in the examples. The multitone spectrum appearance in under-sampling situation greatly depends on the PRBS bit length and the bit rate of the signal. The sampling condition should be carefully chosen for the aliased multi-tone spectra to fall in the baseband with as even spacing as possible to avoid overlapping of the jitter-modulated spectrum with each other. If the Fs and ABW of sampler are given, the higher the PRBS bit rate and the shorter the PRBS bit length, the better for wider tone spacing 6.

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even çgoodé partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity Ö the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the cloudês elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPês synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and Öin at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an çoracleé approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workerês time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling. The total time estimates for running BC on WG and CP graphs, normalized to  
 plot shows speedup of 8 workers relative to 4 workers, for each superstep, when running BC on WG and CP graphs plot shows the number of vertices active in that superstep Estimated time for BC using elastic scaling, normalized to time taken for 4 workers.

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
