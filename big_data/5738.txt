In TCM Radix Astragali RA\ is frequently and widely used in clinical practice In order to explore the associating rules between prescription and syndrome on RA with text mining technique, we downloaded the data set on RA from Chinese BioMedical literature database \(also called SinoMed\. Then, the rules of prescription corresponding to disease and syndrome on RA were mined out by executing data slicing algorithms. The mining results were visually demonstrated with software Cytoscape 2.8. Text mining, together with artificial reading for anti-noising and validation, is an important approach in exploring the rules of prescription corresponding to disease and syndrome. The results showed that RA was usually used in treating diseases of diabetes and cancers For them, blood stasis due to qi deficiency  was the main syndrome in TCM. Moreover, the results demonstrated associations among TCM syndrome, diseases and formulae associated with RA  These associated networks represented a variety of knowledge items which embodied the associating rules between prescription and syndrome on RA Key words: Text mining; Data slicing algorithm; Radix Astragali; associating rules  I. INTRODUCTION Radix Astragali short for RA, Huangqi in Pinyin\s the root either of Astragalus membranaceus Fisch.\ge. var mongholicus MGHQ A. membranaceus  Fisch.\ge. \(MJHQ 1 In traditional Chinese medicine TCM\ is a traditional Chinese herb, which is frequently and widely used in clinical practice Chinese herbal medicine \(CHM\ used under composition rules called Chinese herbology, which is the theory of traditional Chinese herbal therapy 2 Although described elaborately in literature, for researchers, it is impossible to read all the records in literature on RA  With the newly developed techniques of text mining powerful computers, and high speed internet, it is now possible to read them by machines and then report these results through text mining 3, 4  In this study, based on the principle algorithm of data slicing 3 we explored the associated rules of RA within the framework of TCM. These associated rules include RA-syndrome, RA-disease and RA-formulae which were tightly associated with RA in clinical practices  In this study, the associated rules of RA was explored and reported. As these results came from the mass literatures on medical database, therefore, they might be a good reference for clinicians and researchers II. MATERIAL AND METHODS A. Data collection The dataset was downloaded from SinoMed http://sinomed.cintcm.ac.cn/index.jsp\with the query term of Radix Astragaliî on December 29, 2012. This dataset contains 21,891 records of literatures on clinical practices or theoretical researches on RA. In this dataset, each record was tagged with a unique ID. These records contained the title keyword and abstract of published papers 4 which were the resource of data mining  B. Construction of co-occurrent keyword-pairs  According to the knowledge of TCM, we built the keyword lists of TCM syndrome, disease name and formulae Based on these keyword lists, we filtered the title, keyword and abstract of papers downloaded from literature database of SinoMed Then, based on the principle of co-occurrence, we built the keyword-pairs 3-5 For example, in one particular paper, if two keywords of disease concurrent, then, there was a concurrent pair of disease  In the construction of keyword-pairs, not only keyword-pairs of the same category were built, keyword of different categories yet with connection based on TCM knowledge were also built. For example, syndrome and 115 978-1-4673-2971-2/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE Proceedings of 2013 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering May 25 - 28, Beijing, China 


formulae were closely related, in order to get their relationships, we constructed the concurrent pairs according to the same paper ID C. Network construction  In the formulae of TCM \(Fangji in Chinese Pinyin\ome widely used formulae associated with RA were listed with TCM syndromes. Within these formulae, herbal medicines were composited strictly under the compositing theory known as sovereign, minister, assistant and courier \(Jun, Chen, Zuo and Shi in Chinese Pinyin\Different roles of ingredients in prescriptions or formulae had different weights and usages in TCM formulae/prescriptions theory 2  Based on the concurrent keyword-pairs constructed, we built the networks of TCM syndrome and formulae of CHM With these networks constructed, they were demonstrated in figures 1 to 3. In Fig. 1, network of RA-syndrome-disease was demonstrated. In Fig. 2, network of RA-formulae-disease was demonstrated. In Fig. 3, network of RA- syndrome-formulae was demonstrated III. RESULTS For simplicity and clarity, only limited nodes with significant weights were presented in network figures. In these figures, the sizes of the nodes represented the importance of items. Whatís more, nodes with the same shape and color indicated the same group of items  1\RA-Syndrome-Disease Network  RA-syndrome-disease network was demonstrated in Fig 1, the bigger the node, the more tightly the item was associated with RA. In this figure, red big node represented RA which was at the upper center position of the figure. In Fig 1, nodes of yellow in shape square on the left were the top 6 TCM syndromes associated with RA, in which, blood stasis due to qi deficiency was the most significant one On the right side were the nodes of diseases network associated with RA, and diabetes was the main disease associated with RA. Among the top 6 TCM syndromes, blood stasis due to qi deficiency and deficiency of both qi and yin had connections with diabetes, cancer, nephropathy myocarditis, infection and heart failure   Fig.1 Networks of TCM syndrome and disease associated with Radix Astragali  2  RA-Formulae-Disease Network  RA-formulae-disease was demonstrated in Fig. 2. This network demonstrated the connections of associated diseases and formulae with RA. In Fig. 2, for formulae of blue nodes shaped in rhombus on the left section, nodes tagged as Huangqi-Guizhi-Wuwu-Tang, Huangqi-Jian zhong-Tang Huangqi-Tang, Buyang-Huanwu- Tang, Buzhong-Yiqi-Tang and FangjiñHuangqi- Tang were directly associated with RA because they all contained it as their sovereign drug In Fig. 2, the top 6 TCM formulae were tightly associted with diseases on the right side. Among these formulae Huangqi-GuizhiñWu wu-Tang, Huangqi-Jianzhong-Tang Huangqiñ Tang, Buyang-Huanwu-Tang and BuzhongñYi qi-Tang could cure diabetes and cancer  116 


 Fig.2 Networks of formulae and disease associated with Radix Astragali  3  RA- Syndrome-Formula Network  The network of RA-syndrome-formulae was demonstrated in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, the left part was the yellow nodes of TCM syndrome shaped in square, the right section was the blue rhombus of TCM formulae. In this figure Huangqi-Guizhi -Wuwu-Tang could be used in blood stasis due to qi deficiency, deficiency of both qi and yin, deficiency of kidney yang, syndrome of blood stasis and deficiency of both qi and blood. Huangqi-Jianzhong-Tang could cure blood stasis due to qi deficiency, deficiency of both qi and yin deficiency of kidney yang and deficiency of both qi and blood Moreover, blood stasis due to qi deficiency and deficiency of both qi and yin were connected with HuangqiñGuizhiñWuwu-Tang, HuangqiñJianzhong-Tang Huangqi-Tang, Bu yang-HuanwuñTang and BuzhongñYiqi-Tang Furthermore, syndromes in the left part could be divided into excess syndrome \(syndrome of blood stasis\ndrome of intermingled deficiency and excess \(blood stasis due to qi deficiency\d deficiency syndrome \(deficiency of both qi and yin, deficiency of kidney yang, deficiency of both qi and blood, syndrome of qi deficiency\which were separated by red dashed line. At the same time, formulae in the right part could be divided into two categories to cure the syndromes represented by red arrows. The formulae could be consistent to cure the corresponding syndromes based on traditional Chinese medicine theory, as to down-regulate  the excess and to supplement the deficiency  Fig.3 Networks of TCM syndrome and formulae associated with Radix Astragali   IV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION In this study, by executing data slicing algorithm which was based on the principle of co-occurrence, we constructed networks associated with precious CHM RA. These networks focused on three aspects in TCM:  syndrome, disease and formulae. Following the interconnections among these 117 


networks, the associating rules between prescription and syndrome on RA were revealed intuitively 1  TCM networks were found  In this study, through mass calculations on dataset of RA the main aspects of TCM networks were found. These networks included TCM syndrome, disease and herbal formulae. Checked knowledge points demonstrated in Fig. 1, 2 and 3. These knowledge points covered the range of CHM 6  herbal formulae 2 and disease syndrome 7 within the framework of TCM  2  Triangle networks is a clear way for network demonstration  In order to balance the expressiveness and simplicity, we chose the triangle model for the demonstration of associated networks on RA. Also, limited by the model of triangle, only three groups of information could be demonstrated separated figures Centered by red node RA, Fig. 1, 2 and 3 demonstrated the associating rules between prescription and syndrome on RA. For example, Fig. 1 demonstrated the TCM syndromes and diseases associated with RA. Fig.2 demonstrated the formulae and diseases associated with RA. Fig.3 demonstrated the syndromes and formulae associated with RA. In Fig.3, syndromes were divided into three categories, following which, the formulae were divided. Due to syndrome of blood stasis in Fig.3 was caused by syndrome of qi deficiency, so the formulae coule be divided into two categories   ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by National Science Foundation of China \(No. 30825047, 30902003, 30973975 81273631 and 81072982\.

thus enable a cloud-based analytics solution to make headway into the SMB market  Common Analytics Needs Given a low-analytics penetration and ignorance about analytics capabilities, in addition to us seeking answers to open-ended questions such as çWhat are the top-3 tasks that you would want analytics support for?é, we ended up first educating the respondents about common capabilities analytics can bring to the table Based on such responses, we categorized the top analytics functionalities into four broad tasks, as listed in Table 4. We will illustrate in a later section that each such task may be modeled in its own multi-flow  Most Demanded Analytics Functionality 1. Customer Segmentation  2. Targeted Marketing  3. Demand Forecasting  4. Association Rule Learning  Table 4. Survey Results on Analytics Functionalities B  Multi-flows in the Retail Prototype Based on the survey findings, we built a fully functional prototype of the cloud analytics system with configurable and extensible multi-flows. We implement multi-flows for the following functionalities   Unsupervised Customer Segmentation   Supervised Customer Segmentation   Association Rule Learning We delve into details of these workflows in the following sub-sections. We will present a screenshot of each of the workflows, and describe the finer details of the overall system, in a subsequent section  1  Unsupervised Customer Segmentation This flow \(Fig. 8\es customer demographic data and aggregated transaction data and segments users into multiple groups, the number of groups being specified by the user Customers with similar aggregated transaction attributes e.g., similar monthly spends\ and similar demographics are likely to be placed in the same group. We use the popular KMeans clustering algorithm [9 o r s e gm e n ti ng cus to m e r s  into the specified number of groups \(i.e., clusters  2  Supervised Customer Segmentation This flow \(Fig. 9\ery similar to the example illustrated in Section II C. The idea is to be able to predict a customerês likely value in terms of well-known labels \(e.g silver, gold, platinum customers etc.\ed on just the demographic data of the customer; demographic data is the only data available at the time the customer signs-up for a loyalty program. Such prediction involves functionality to learn a predictive model based on either labeled customer data, or rules that are applied on aggregated transaction data The learned model can then be used on the demographics of a new customer to predict on the likely value of the customer  Figure 7. Unsupervised Segmentation Workflow   Figure 8. Supervised Segmentation Workflow   Figure 9. Association Rule Learning Workflow  3  Association Rule Learning The task of learning correlations between products in purchase patterns 12 is a popular analytics task on market basket data since it was proposed in T h is inv o lv e s  automatically learning correlations such as onions potatoes 004 burger which indicates that customers who buy onions and potatoes together are likely to also buy burgers. Our workflow \(Fig. 9\upports fine-tuning of association rule mining with provisions to restrict rule learning to transactions containing specific products, or transactions of customers that satisfy a specific condition on demographic attributes  C  Configurability and multi-flows in the Retail Prototype Configurability There are two configurable operators among the multi-flows in our prototype. For the K-means clustering operator, the number of clusters is a configurable parameter. As can be seen in Figure 7, an edit box enables the user to choose the number of clusters for the segmentation. The association rule learning operator in Figure 9, apart from having provisions to specify common    12  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning

parameters such as the confidence and support, allows for the following fine tuning   Antecedent Product Often, the intent of learning association rules is to figure out what kind of products can be bundled together to create a combo offer. In this case, one of the products \(e.g., a new product whose sales need to be boosted\ already known, and the customer can choose to search for only those rules that have the selected product as the antecedent. This is enabled by a drop-down box titled Antecedent in Figure 9. The default option is to search for general rules including all products among antecedents   Gender In cases where gender-based association rules are to be discovered, the user of the system has the option to restrict association rule learning only to those transactions that involve a customer of a specific gender, as against the default case where customers of all genders are included   Age Bounds The use can also specify age bounds of customers, such that only transactions by customers within the selected age range are included during association rule learning   Transaction or Demographic Rules Finally, the user can specify the type of rules mined. The options provided are to discover classical product correlations using the transaction data or to mine for demographic ru h ich are ru les th at in dicate correlation s  between demographic attributes; the rule age:<30  004   location:indiranagar indicates that most young customers of the store are from the Indiranagar area  Transaction metadata based fine tuning of association rule learning, as supported by the gender and age bounds attributes in our prototype, may be used in applications to get fine-grained insights into buying behavior [11     Multi-Flow Due to the provision of different attach points for data, each of the three implemented scenarios are multiflows; for example, choosing to attach aggregated transaction data automatically discards the aggregation operator from the flow. Figure 10 illustrates two distinct flows as two specific black rectangles in the supervised segmentation scenario. The bigger workflow, from the left involves demographic data and transaction data that are merged to learn a model to classify customers. The workflow on the right accepts pre-classified and merged data that can be directly used to learn the classification model. We let the user select a workflow by his/her choice of datasets to attach  We automatically infer which workflow from the multiflow needs to be executed based on the data source attachpoints chosen. At the beginning, all four drop-down boxes for attaching data sources \(see Figure 10\re enabled; the moment the user chooses to attach a dataset at the labeled customer training data the system infers the choice of the right-side workflow and disables the three other drop-down boxes. Similarly, if the first data source attachment is to the  aggregated transaction data it infers that aggregation is no longer necessary and disables the transaction data  drop-down box since there is no workflow that uses both these drop-down boxes. Such relations, and which dropdown boxes to disable on each action, are automatically inferred from a configuration file that comprehensively lists the workflows contained in the multi-flow. If the user, at any point, needs to revert a selection and get back to a state where all data source drop-downs are enabled, she can click on the reset button   Figure 10. Two Flows  D  Other features of the system In order to provide an end-to-end solution for cloud-based analytics with configurable and extensible multi-flows, our system implements several functionalities. Those features are implementation-specific and only tangentially related to the main theme of the paper. However, to complete the description of the system, we give a brief overview  1  Analytics Engines and Data Systems Used Though our implementation is flexible and configurable to add analytics engines and data systems as necessary by changing a few configuration files, we use an SPSS engine and a DB2 instance as the only analytics engine and data system respectively  Figure 11. Data Sources Pane  2  Data Uploading We have implemented functionalities for uploading data from a disk file; we accept files in the CSV format \(commaseparated values\where the first line is used to denote the names of the attributes followed by rows of data. On the server side, uploaded files can be kept in file format \(within the serverês file system\r can be materialized as a relational table in the attached DB2 system; indexes may be created as needed on those tables to aid analytical

processing. We call these çfile data sourcesé and çtable data sourcesé respectively. Our data sources pane has functionalities to create either table or file data sources by uploading a chosen CSV file, as shown in Figure 11   Figure 12. View Creation Fu nctionality \(left\ in operation \(right  3  Data Source Attachment Each data attach-point has a specific minimum schema  expectation to be able to make use of the data source attached. The minimum schema expectation makes some attributes mandatory. For example, a demographic data source is required to have a çCustomerIDé attribute that uniquely identifies each customer.  It may have any number of additional attributes; for example, in the unsupervised segmentation workflow, any additional attribute of a customer is used by the clustering algorithm to measure the similarity between customers. Often, the minimum schema attribute names may not exactly match the customerês attribute names. For example, the customer may use CustIDé to uniquely identify a customer whereas the attach-point may be expecting çCustomerIDé. We have incorporated a view creation facility that helps the customer to create a non-materialized view by mapping the attributes in her data source to those expected by the minimum schema. Once such a view is created, it appears as another data source, and can be chosen from the drop down list of data sources. Figure 12 shows how view creation functionality gives the user the option to pick an attribute from her source to the minimum schema attribute, in this case ID, CUSTID, TRANSACTIONDATE, and TOTALPRICE 4  Downloading Results We implemented the workflow execution as an asynchronous operation, where the user finishes the setup uploading data, attaching data sources, choosing the workflow to be executed\d clicks on çsubmité.

Cloud computing provides shared resources, software and information to computing devices as a utility over the network. It has become widely popular over the last few years and has been assessed to be no less influential than any of the previous trendsetting technologies [13   T h o ugh m a n y o b s ta c l e s to the u s a g e o f  cloud computing have been identified in e s a me report emphasizes that the utility of cloud computing is likely to outweigh its disadvantages. Cloud computing provides many advantages such as elasticity and transference of over-provisioning and under-provisioning risks. Forecas u g g e s t th at clou d co m p u t i n g  w oul d  grow at a very fast rate over the next few years.  Cloud computing has been used for a variety of tasks such as parallel data mining d g raph an al y tic s 16   Analytics Services Though popular analytics engines such as SAS, SPSS and R started off as stand-alone applications that need to be installed on a server to be used, recent trends suggest that commercial analytics engines are not far off from delivering full-fledged analytics capabilities on the cloud. Predixion Software 13 and Zementis 14 offer scoring of any PMML 15 model over the cloud, whereas SAS has started to offer many of their functionalities over the cloud  How ev er, to th e bes t of ou r k n o w l edg e, th ere h a s been  a very limited work on providing powerful analytics functionalities over the cloud that can readily be used without requiring considerable expertise in analytics and the specific tool to be used  Workflows for Analytics The main novelty of the solution proposed in this paper rests in the usage of configurable and extensible multi-workflows to make it easy to use analytics despite limited technical know-how. Analytics workflows themselves are not novel and are the primary means of using SPSS \(with the SPSS Modeler component\wever, a typical SPSS workflow is designed to be used by personnel who understand the semantics of typical data mining operations. In particular, SPSS provides a fleet of functionality that is powerful enough to be used across domains, and is not specific to the scenario in which it may be deployed. For example, the semantics of the CustID field is unknown to a generic clustering operator, and under a default setting, the clustering operator would use the CustID field also for clustering leading to the undesirable results of    13  http://www.predixionsoftware.com/predixion  14  http://www.zementis.com  15  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language

grouping customers with numerically close CustIDs together. We eliminate the need to explicitly specify the exclusion of such attributes, by folding in the semantics of attributes such as CustID \(among others\to the prepackaged workflows. In a pre-packaged workflow for customer segmentation, the fact that CustID needs to be excluded in clustering would already be already preconfigured. The customer can thereby focus on configuring other parameters that are likely to affect business such as number of clusters in the outp ut or the rules to use in designating customers as high-value or low-value. The concept of multi-flows, where a single template workflow can instantiate many possible workflows, has not been developed in prior literature to the best of our knowledge VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Analytics, despite its apparent utility in improving business has not been adopted widely. The main deterrents include the large upfront cost of procuring computing infrastructure and the cost of setting up an in-house analytics team of statisticians and business analysts. Such costs are so high that many small and medium businesses cannot afford traditional analytics solutions, especially in the developing regions of the world due to a spectrum of other deterrent factors that we have outlined. Many such deterrents may be effectively eliminated by the delivery of analytics services on the cloud. In this paper, we propose configurable pre-packaged multi-flows flows that span multiple workflows\ to deliver analytics services on the cloud towards helping to improve analytics penetration Multi-flows bundle together related workflows enabling users to explore and exploit related functionality by making minor configuration changes. We illustrate how changes to workflow configurations may be made easily without any in-depth knowledge of the various operators involved. Our multi-flows are easily extensible to non-disruptively include new functionalities in response to the changing needs of a customer \(or a changing customer base We described a survey of Indian retail players that helped us identify \(and validate our assumptions of\e primary obstacles to analytics penetration in the sector; we also analyzed the major analytics needs of such businesses. We illustrated that many such common analytics needs may be effectively captured within a small number of workflows We developed a fully-functional system that implements the chosen multi-flows for the retail sector. We detailed the various features of the system, the multi-ness of the flows in the system, and example configuration settings that can be used to fine tune specific multi-flows. Through generous usage of screenshots, we illustrated the ease of use of our system; we expect that such enhanced convenience of usage will aid penetration of analytics into new customer bases  Future Work We are exploring further enhancements to improve ease of use of analytics solutions on the cloud including an automatic mapping of attributes in data sources to attach-points by exploiting the data type and distribution Also, making analytics widespread would necessarily involve addressing some of the problems that are applicable to cloud computing in general. These include concerns about data privacy in the cloud and the loss of control of the computation elopin g techn iqu es  to eff ecti v el y an d  provably anonymize of data without affecting the results of specific operators such as clustering or classification is an interesting direction to pursue A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Abhishek Subramanian, Neethu Suresh Shubhendu Aggarwal and Varun Srivastava for efforts in implementing the system and performing market surveys VII  R EFERENCES  1  Todd Morrison, çRetail chain uses in-house analytics team to run SAP BusinessObjectsé, TechTarget Search SAP, 4 th March, 2011 http://searchsap.techtarget.com/news/2240033086/Retail-chain-uses-in-houseanalytics-team-to-run-SAP-BusinessObjects  2  Rakesh Agrawal, and Ramakrishnan Srikant, çFast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databasesé,  VLDB 1994, Chile 3  How to structure a business analytics team http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.in/2011/09/business-analytics-teamstructure.html Retrived March 2, 2012 4  MA Rappa, çThe utility business model and the future of computing services IBM Systems Journal, 43\(1\ 2004 5  Brian Hayes, çCloud Computingé, Comm.

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
