WONG Akhtar KALAM Robert BARR Victoria University Australia Victoria Universi ty  Australia Electric Power Consulting Australia kaicheung.wong@live.vu.edu.au akhtar.kalam@vu.edu.au rbarr@epc.com.au ABSTRACT This paper provides analysis of over and under voltage events captured by smart meters. Using data analysis techniques, the relationship of voltage events is analyzed with respect to ambient temperature, times of the day days of the week, duration, magnitude and embedded generation status. Clusters of voltage violation sites are grouped to upstream supply distribution substations and zone substations. The analysis forms the basis of proactive voltage improvement that can be undertaken by the supply utility INTRODUCTION Jemena Electricity Networks JEN\ electricity distribution company in the state of Victoria, Australia, is currently undertaking a government mandated program to roll out smart meters to 310,000 residential and small commercial consumers. 50% of the smart meters have been installed by December 2012, with the full rollout scheduled to complete by the end of 2014 These smart meters capture 30-minute energy usage data import and export\ and report to centralized computer systems via a two-way communication infrastructure The smart meters also monitor steady state voltages With the installation of smart meters, voltage sensing is progressively available at Low Voltage \(LV supply points of the electricity dist ribution network. While the availability of supply voltage data is a welcoming development, JEN is now obligated to investigate and correct non-compliance as revealed by the smart meters DESIGN OF THE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM Fig 1 is a simplified representation of the electricity supply system in the state of Victoria, Australia. The power stations are connected by the transmission network to the terminal stations. At the terminal stations the transmission voltages are stepped down into subtransmission voltages. The distribution companies take supply from the terminal stations and distribute to end customers through further voltage transformation at zone and distribution substations. It is noteworthy that the distribution companies generally run a 4-wire low voltage distribution network from each distribution substation which can supply up to 150 customers On-load tap changers and automatic voltage regulation are applied at the power stations, terminal stations and zone substations, and Medium Voltage \(MV\ in-line voltage regulators for long rural lines. In suburban distribution network, voltage regulation at the zone 
substations would be designed to allow for voltage drop on the MV distribution line, the distribution transformer and the LV feeder runs, to ensure that the last customer at the end of the LV feeder will be supplied with sufficient voltage during peak load period.  There is therefore a tendency to design for a supply voltage at the high end of the prescribed range CONSEQUENCES OF VOLTAGE NON COMPLIANCE Public electricity supply networks are required to deliver voltages within narrow ranges. This ensures that the supply voltages are compatible with the design parameters of consumer electrical equipment. Supply voltage non-compliance has high societal costs as it impacts on the efficiency, performance and life expectancy of el ectrical equipment Except for large commercial or industrial customers however, direct monitoring of the quality of voltage delivered is not possible due to the relatively high cost of providing measurement at each customerís point of supply. Electricity distribution utilities generally adopt a reactive approach of responding to customer voltage complaints. This approach could be appropriate if it is expected that supply voltages are within declared range for most customers and most of the time. This is because customers generally only complain of high or low voltage Figure 1 Typical Electricity Supply System in Victoria, Australia   POWER STATION TERMINAL STATION ZONE SUBSTATION

Hidden costs such as lower equipment efficiency and shortened equipment life are not obvious to most customers The recent growth in embedded generation \(EG\to electricity distribution networks, facilitated by government greenhouse gas reduction policy, has highlighted the undesirability of high supply voltages For EG to generate power back into the supply network the voltage at the point of common coupling \(PCC would need to be raised above the utility supply voltage There could be local voltage rise along the supply circuit instead of voltage drop [1 2 3 less t h ese  challenges are overcome, curtailment of EG would have to be in place or expensive network augmentation would be required to accommodate the increasing penetration of EG FORM OF VOLTAGE QUALITY DATA The AMI communication technology utilised by JEN is a mesh radio network between the AMI meters and the meter Access Points. To conserve the limited bandwidth of the mesh radio system, a "report by exception methodology has been adopted for voltage quality events Under and over voltage events are generated locally in the smart meter whenever the set thresholds are exceeded The events are then transmitted to the central Network Management System The undervoltage and overvoltage thresholds are set as follow Undervoltage set point is 216V \(230V 6 Overvoltage set point is 253V \(230V + 10 Events are only generated when the set point is exceeded for a time period of 180 seconds or more The events consist of information such as meter identification, event date, start time \(for start events\d time \(for stop events\e voltage, maximum minimum\oltage, supply address etc Cognos has been chosen as the Business Intelligence tool for data analysis. For the purpose of exploratory data analysis, the events can also be downloaded from the Network Management System as Comma-Separated Values \(CSV for analysis by software packages such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access or MatLab VOLTAGE QUALITY DATA THE BIG DATA Gartner, leading information technology research and advisory company, defines "big data as having characteristics that can be denoted by three "Vs Volume  Velocity and Variety Voltage quality data is a form of big data" as it possesses the following characteristics Volume A snapshot of over and undervoltage events reported by 100,000 smart meters, over a 6-day period in summer 2012, is shown in Fig. 2 below It can be seen from Fig. 2 that overvoltage condition is a regular occurrence affecting approximately 6,000 customer sites \(6%\dervoltage condition is equally significant affecting approximately 5,000 customer sites 5%\ but only on high ambient temperature days triggered by the use of space cooling equipment On the other hand, based on customer voltage complaints confirmed under and over voltage cases total about 120 in calendar year 2011 The voltage quality data that JEN has to process from smart meters are voluminous in comparison to customer voltage complaints Velocity Velocity refers to the speed of data generation and disappearance A total of 6,131 customer sites have experienced undervoltage in the 6-day period. However, not all 6,131 sites experienced undervoltage throughout the six days In other words undervoltage conditions are transient in nature and do not form an easily recognisable pattern Refer Table 1 below TABLE 1 ANALYSIS OF THE 6,131 UNDERVOLTAGE SITES Number of sites experiencing undervoltage One day of the 6day period Two days of the 6day period Three days of the 6-day period Four days of the 6day period Five days of the 6day period Six days of the 6day period 2,195 2,033 1,828 55 7 13  Figure 2 Number of sites experiencing over and undervoltage events on six consecutive da y s with different dail y maximum tem p eratures  0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 25.8 37.1 37.1 33.2 25.1 21.1 Number of sites Maximum daily temperature \(oC Number of sites giving over and undervoltage events Number of sites giving undervoltage events Number of sites giving overvoltage events

The sample data sets consist of voltage events collected from 100,000 active smart meters over the 6-day period from 23 to 28 Feb 2012. Other database extracts include network topology snapshots from GIS, residential photovoltaic \(PV installation data from GIS, meter reference data from SAP, and ambient temperature information from the Bureau of Meteorology The exploratory data analysis reveals the following useful insight Strong correlation of undervoltage events with ambient temperature undervoltage events virtually non-existent at ambient temperature below mid 20's, and rising rapidly when ambient temperature reaches the mid 30's Overvoltage events, on the other hand, do not show strong correlation with ambient temperature Majority of overvoltage events are caused by the existing voltage regulation being set "a tab" too high. Care needs to be exercised, however, to ensure that dropping the voltage regulation setting will not lead to worsening of the undervoltage situation on hot days The appropriateness of conventional Load Drop Compensation voltage regulation schemes may need to be reviewed Definitive pattern of start times can be observed for undervoltage events.

The effect will become more significant as the penetration of PV increases further Priority for voltage non compliance investigation and rectification can be set based on the level of voltage deviation and time duration as revealed by the smart meter voltage events Clusters of voltage events around particular distribution substations may indicate inappropriate  off-load transformer tap setting Clusters of distribution substations around particular zone substations may indicate inappropriate on-load tap change setting Customers who experience both overvoltage and undervoltage events may indicate an upstream asset overload condition Details of the analysis results can be found in [4   FUTURE WORK Due to the limitation posed by Microsoft Excel in the size of CSV files that it can handle and the computational speed, only 6-day of voltage events can be analysed at one time JEN intends to leverage on the insight gained through the exploratory data analysis and implement in its Business Intelligence tool Cognos provided by IBM JEN is also considering other grid analytics tools such as Teradata and Greenplum for applications that demand much faster response times For the Victoria University research project, the next phase focuses on modelling residential PV generation and its effect on voltage delivery in electricity distribution network. The ultimate aim of the research project is to develop innovative voltage control scheme that maximises the amount of PV that can be accommodated ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to express their appreciation to Victoria University for granting a research scholarship and Jemena Electricity Networks for contributing smart meter data to this research project REFERENCES  F ila, M T a y l or, G A   Hi s c ock  J. ; Irv i n g   M.R    Lang, P. ; ìFlexible Voltage Control to Support Distributed Generation in Distribution Networks 43 rd International Universities Power Engineering Conference, 2008  B l azie, B   P f aj f a r T   P a pie, I V oltag e C ontrol in Networks with Distributed Generation A Case Studyî, IEEE PES/IAS Conference on Sustainable Alternative Energy \(SAE 3 L i e w  S.N. ; Strb ac, G  M a x i m isi n g p e n e tratio n o f  wind generation in existing distribution networks IEE Proceedings in Generation, Transmission and Distribution, Volume 149 , Issue 3, May 2002 4 W o n g  P  K.C. ; B a rr, R A   K a la m   A    A n a l y sis o f  Voltage Quality Data from Smart Meters Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference, 2012 5 W o n g  P  K.C. ; B a rr R.A  Kala m   A   U sin g  smart meter data to improve quality of voltage delivery in public electricity distribution networks Saudi Arabia Smart Grid Conference, 2012

Empirical research in the two dimensions of the industries and regions showed that there is a significant differenc e between CRE holding and companies\222 market performance in different industries and regions. The commercial industry is more significant than others, the higher the ratio of real estate lead to the lower stock returns. For all industries, there are also negative effects, but the impact is not very obvious. In the study of companies\222 risk affected by the real estate company, we found that the CRE holdings have a significant impact on the volatility of stock returns, and there are significant differences in v arious industries. Among them, the impact on the commerce is the most significant  In the subsequent work, we will further do research on the real reason for why non real estate companies held CRE, if the non real estate companies did not get the return on  risky investment by holding CRE that likely because these companies have other reasons to hold these assets in addition to the pursuit of gains, which may be due to other factors that affect the development of enterprises, and in the future we will do fur ther study on this   References   1 Brueggman W B  J D  Fisher D M Porter.

The proposed approach can easily be applied to any number of sensors with different accuracies any number of emitters and any number of measured features The performance of the proposed classification approach is evaluated in terms of percentage of correct classification and compared to Euclidean metric classification Singer-Kanyuck  metric classification and a fuzzy classification approach The proposed approach achieves higher performance for all values of noise standard deviation compared to the other 


 7  classification approaches The proposed classification approach has the following advantages 1 The classification weights of the sensor resolutions are affected by the measured feature vectors This means that the classification weights are adapted and changed automatically 2 The classification weights of the comparison terms are obtained by treating all the feature vectors once Thus it avoids the conflict situation when treating the feature vectors pairwise 3 The proposed classification approach reduces the computational complexity with a factor of f n  where f n is the total number of features This is because the proposed classification approach assigns only one classification weight to each feature vector. This means that the number of comparisons does not grow with the number of features This also reduces the sensitivity of the final classification decision to individual feature instabilities and 4 Feature vectors containing kinematics and non-kinematics data can be processed R EFERENCES  1  Ashraf M Aziz A Soft-Decision Fusion Approach for Multiple-Sensor Distributed Binary Detection Systems IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems vol. 47, No.3, July 2011, p. 2208-2216  2  J Hu and R S Blum Application of Distributed Signal Detection to Multiuser Communication Systems IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, vol. 38, No. 4, Oct. 2002, p. 12201229 001   3  E Waltz and J Llinas Multisensor Data Fusion Norwood, MA, Artech House, 1990  4  Ashraf M Aziz M Tummala and R Cristi Fuzzy Logic Data Correlation Approach in MultisensorMultitarget Tracking Systems Signal Processing vol 76, No. 2, July 1999, p 195-209  5  Cheng Qi , P.

tionship between beer brands and customers Our proposed criterion played an important role in determining the number of clusters in this analysis We nally compare our proposed criterion with other ones For example AIC discovered four customer clusters and the customer behavior suggested by each cluster is rather different from that given by NML ICL selected only ve brand clusters whereas results of NML also distinguished brand clusters B and E Each of these results shows certain aspects of the data but we emphasize that the model selection results given by NML are justiìed from the perspective of data compression VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have addressed the issue of statistical model selection in GRD modeling From the viewpoint of the MDL principle we have clariìed the asymptotic property of NML in GRD modeling and have proposed a new model selection criterion We have applied our proposed criterion to the issue of model selection in SBM learning and have derived a new and efìcient method of calculating the NML code-length for SBM The effectiveness of our NML-based criterion has been demonstrated experimentally using artiìcial data and real beer-purchase data Thus for the rst time we have realized a model selection technique that considers the statistical characteristics of GRD models We will extend our discussion to other problems and criteria A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by MEXT KAKENHI 23240019 by the Aihara Project the FIRST program from JSPS initiated by CSTP by HAKUHODO Inc and by MACROMILL Inc R EFERENCES  B Long Z Zhang and P  S Y u  Relational Data Clustering Models Algorithms and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2010  T  Roos T  Silander  P  K ontkanen and P  Myllymaki Bayesian network structure learning using factorized NML universal models in Information Theory and Applications Workshop  Feb 2008 pp 272 276  P  K ontkanen P  Myllym  aki W Buntine J Rissanen and H Tirri An MDL framework for data clustering in Advances in Minimum Description Length Theory and Applications  MIT Press 2005  A T  Cemgil Bayesian inference for nonne gati v e matrix factorisation models Intell Neuroscience  vol 2009 pp 4:1Ö4:17 Jan 2009  H Akaik e  A ne w look at the statistical model identiìcation  IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control  vol 19 no 6 pp 716  723 Dec 1974  G E Schw arz Estimating the dimension of a model  Annals of Statistics  vol 6 pp 461Ö464 1978  E M Airoldi D M Blei S E Fienber g and E P  Xing Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels J Mach Learn Res  vol 9 pp 1981Ö2014 Jun 2008  J Rissanen Modeling by shortest data description  Automatica  vol 14 no 5 pp 465  471 1978   Fisher information and stochastic comple xity   IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 42 no 1 pp 40 47 Jan 1996  Y  M Shtark o v  Uni v ersal sequential coding of single messages Problems of Information Transmission  vol 23 no 3 pp 3Ö17 1987  S Hirai and K Y amanishi Ef cient computation of normalized maximum likelihood coding for Gaussian mixtures with its applications to optimal clustering in Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ISIT  Aug 2011 pp 1031 1035  J Rissanen MDL denoising  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 46 no 7 pp 2537 2543 Nov 2000  Y  Hayashi and K Y amanishi Sequential netw ork change detection with its applications to ad impact relation analysis in IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM2012  2012 pp 280Ö289  T  A Snijders and K No wicki Estimation and prediction for stochastic blockmodels for graphs with latent block structure Journal of Classiìcation  vol 14 pp 75Ö100 1997  N Friedman L Getoor  D  K oller  and A Pfef fer  Learning probabilistic relational models in Proceedings of the 16th international joint conference on Artiìcial intelligence  vol 2 1999 pp 1300Ö1307  J.-J Daudin F  Picard and S Robin A mixture model for random graphs Statistics and Computing  vol 18 no 2 pp 173Ö183 2008  C K emp J B T enenbaum T  L Grif ths T  Y amada and N Ueda Learning systems of concepts with an inìnite relational model in Proceedings of the 21st national conference on Artiìcial intelligence  2006 pp 381Ö388  C S W allace and P  R Freeman Estimation and inference by compact coding Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B Methodological  vol 49 no 3 pp pp 240Ö265 1987  C Biernacki G Celeux and G Go v aert  Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence IEEE Transactions on  vol 22 no 7 pp 719Ö725 2000  H Jef fre ys  A n i n v ariant form for the prior probability in estimation problems in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A Mathematical and Physical Sciences  vol 186 no 1007 1946 pp 453Ö461  I S Dhillon S Mallela and D S Modha Informationtheoretic co-clustering in Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  2003 pp 89Ö98 429

and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US foreign policy  This paper has multiple limitations on its research. The datasets included are only for the three most recent female Secretar ies of State and cannot be used to generalize an overall US foreign policy message. Also, there is a gap between the three female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary Powell was not included Another limitation is the lack of keyword in context analysis. Although these keywords and phrases are important due to their number of times used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of these important keywords and phrases will lead to deeper insights and more complex nuances  This study is an initial analysis on three separate datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to deeper understandings of the frequently occurring keywords and phrases that are predominant from each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will provide further unpacking a nd clearer definitions of what each keyword or phrase means when the Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and geography. This analysis will be completed on Secretary Rice and Secretary Albrightês datasets as well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powellês tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes are consistent with those before and after his term Future research will also include the final two approaches from the ASSANA Methodology traditional hand coding as well as the High Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating these other approaches will allow for a full review of the differences in findings and time for analysis between each approach
