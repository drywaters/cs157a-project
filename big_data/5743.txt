Mining and Representing Rare Association Rules through the Use of Genetic Programming Jos  e Mar  a Luna Jos  eRa  ul Romero Sebasti  an Ventura Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis University of C  ordoba C  ordoba Spain  i32luarj jrromero sventura  uco.es Abstract Whereas the extraction of frequent patterns has focused the major researches in association rule mining the requirements of reliable rules that do not frequently appear is taking an increasing interest in a great number of areas This eld has not been explored in depth and most algorithms for mining infrequent association rules follow an exhaustive search methodology which hampers the extracting process because of the size of the datasets The importance of discovering patterns that do not frequently appear in a dataset and the promising results obtained when using evolutionary proposals in the eld of frequent pattern mining motivates the evolutionary proposal for discovering rare association rules presented in this paper Here a contextfree grammar is described and applied to adapt individuals to each particular problem or domain The use of both an evolutionary approach and a context-free grammar reduces the memory requirements and provides the possibility of extracting any kind of rules respectively The experimental study shows that this proposal obtains a set of reliable infrequent rules in a short period of time Keywords Rare Association Rule Infrequent Rule Mining Grammar-based Evolutionary Algorithms I I NTRODUCTION The mining of association rules is a technique whose purpose is the extraction of close relations between patterns from datasets The discovery of such relationships which can be represented as a relation IF antecedent THEN consequent within a vast amount of data could greatly help in the decision-making process Both the antecedent and the consequent are sets of conditions that do not have any attribute in common The meaning of an association rule is that if its antecedent is satisìed then it is highly probable that its consequent would be also satisìed The rst algorithm proposed for the extraction of this kind of relations was presented by Agrawal et al  This wellknown algorithm called Apriori works into two phases While in a rst step is used for discovering patterns that frequently appear in a dataset in the second phase it obtains the relationships between those patterns previously mined The main objective is to discover reliable relations that frequently appear in a dataset Most algorithms in this eld are based on this Apriori proposal where the computation time the memory requirements and the extraction of categorical relations are its main limitations These limitations have been studied in depth by the research community Han et al  proposed the FPGrowth algorithm whose aim is the discovery of association rules in a more efìcient way To this end a tree structure for storing information about frequent patterns was the main innovation In such a way FP-Growth works on this structure instead of the dataset Recently different researchers have focused their studies in evolutionary proposals so a large number of evolutionary algorithms EA for mining frequent association rules have been proposed 4 5 Despite the mining of frequent association rules is the main motivation of most researchers there are situations where it is interesting to discover abnormal or unusual behaviour in datasets extracting rare or infrequent patterns i.e those that do not follow the trend of the majority Communication failure detection is an important eld where this kind of associations becomes interesting In an infrequent pattern mining proposal was presented for real time detection of intrusive or anomalous packets in wireless networks Medicine is another eld where rare or infrequent association rules play an important role in the recognition of patients who suffer a particular disease that does not often occur The rst approaches for mining infrequent association rules consisted in extracting very low frequency of occurrence patterns by means of a low threshold which was used in Apriori to discard infrequent patterns However due to the number of candidate patterns the use of a low threshold drastically increases its execution runtime Other proposals consisted in adjusting the previously existing frequent pattern mining algorithms as Apriori-Infrequent 7 Different proposals have been presented for mining infrequent association rules One of them called AprioriInverse was proposed by Koh and Rountree  Similarly to Apriori this algorithm works into two phases The rst one consists in the discovery of those patterns that appear in the dataset more frequently than a minimum threshold but less than a maximum The second step is to discover reliable association rules over the patterns previously mined Another algorithm called ARIMA was presented by Szathmary et 86 978-1-4577-1124-4/11/$26.00 c  2011 IEEE

disco v ering the minimal rare patterns i.e those infrequent patterns that comprise frequent subsets Then based on these minimal rare patterns ARIMA extracts all the possible supersets that appear at least once in the dataset Finally similarly to every Aprioribased approach this algorithm searches for reliable relations between those patterns previously discovered Consequently a major shortcoming of these proposals for mining rare association rules is their high computational time requirements Since they are exhaustive search algorithms the growth of the dataset size causes an exponential increase of the computational time and the memory requirements Additionally these algorithms mine very infrequent association rules since no minimum frequency threshold is applied over the whole rule Finally it should be noted that existing proposals obtain rare association rules in categorical domains so numerical attributes have to be discretized in a previous step These shortcomings have not been studied in depth in this eld Therefore considering the promising results obtained in this paper presents a grammar based evolutionary proposal for the extraction of infrequent association rules The strength of using grammars in the association rule mining eld is the possibility of adapting the grammar to each speciìc problem which allows of obtaining association rules in both numerical and categorical domains Furthermore the use of an evolutionary schema overcomes the computational time and memory requirement shortcomings To analyse its effectiveness we compare this approach to other exhaustive search algorithms in the rare association rule mining eld showing that it obtains rare and reliable relations between patterns in a pretty efìcient way This paper is arranged as follows Section 2 describes the model for mining rare association rules Section 3 presents the datasets used in the experiments the experimental set-up and the results obtained nally some concluding remarks are outlined in Section 4 II M INING R ARE A SSOCIATION R ULES The drawbacks of the existing proposals in mining association rules were overcomed by using a grammar-based evolutionary proposal Re gardless of the dataset size and the domain of its attributes the use of both grammars and an evolutionary model provided reliable rules that comprised patterns in any domain and in an efìcient way As mentioned above the strength of using a grammar in any eld and particularly in association rule mining comes from its ability to be adapted to each speciìc problem In this proposal each association rule is represented by means of a tree-structure with the help of a contextfree grammar CFG The use of tree-structures allows of representing rules with different sizes and shapes Furthermore the use of CFG determines the syntax constraints and the domains under application The proposal deìnes each individual by a genotype designated by the tree-structure and a phenotype representing the rare association rule A CFG is deìned as a four-tuple  N   T  P  S   where  T and  N represent the alphabets of terminal and nonterminal symbols respectively having these alphabets no items in common i.e  N   T    P is deìned as the set of production rules comprising a number of production rules of the form    where    N  and    T   N    Each individual represents a sentence generated by the grammar and deìned by means of a tree-structure where the root is the symbol S  A derivation process is carried out starting from the start symbol of the grammar to obtain indviduals A number of steps is performed by using the set P of production rules To avoid trees which are too deep the number of production rules used in the derivation process must be previously predeìned by the data mining expert Figure 1 shows a sample grammar used for mining association rules over both numerical and categorical datasets Each association rule may comprise a number of conditions concatenated by the operator AND  The number of conditions that may appear in each association rule is not preìxed but it depends on the number of derivations performed The minimum number of conditions is the only 2011 Third

restriction imposed by the grammar i.e both the antecedent and the consequent should be composed of at least one condition Finally it is noteworthy to mention that two logic operators are available for each categorical condition whereas four logic operators are provided for numerical conditions However since grammars can be adapted to each speciìc problem the one in Figure 1 could be also adapted for mining rules with only one condition in the consequent or even for mining conditions with only the equal logic operator A Evaluate Individuals The process of evaluating each individual is a major issue because of the large number of them that it is possible to extract in a speciìc problem Different researchers have described some objective measures for evaluating association rules T w o o f the most important and widely used measures in this eld are support and conìdence The former is deìned as the proportion of the number of transactions including the antecedent and consequent in a dataset The latter is deìned as the proportion of the number of transactions that include the antecedent and consequent among all the transactions that comprise the antecedent In this proposal whereas the support measure is used to discover rules that do not frequently appear in a dataset the conìdence is used to obtain reliable association rules In opposition to Apriori-based algorithms the EA described in this paper does not require two phases to mine rules In this algorithm each rule is evaluated according to a tness function which is deìned in Equation 1 and whose goal is to search for infrequent rules i.e those that do not exceed a maximum support threshold The tness values available are shown in Figure 2 Despite rules with a support value belonging to the interval obtain the same tness value a new way to properly differentiate between them is required In such a way the best individuals i.e those with the maximum tness function values are ranked according to the conìdence measure Thus among those rules with the maximum tness function values the most reliable ones will be considered the best Fitness   1 if 0  support  Max 0 otherwise 1 A major difference between the proposed algorithm and any Apriori-based one is that whereas the former searches for rules that do not exceed a maximum support threshold the latter searches for patterns that do no exceed this threshold This search leads to the mining of very infrequent rules since the support of a group of patterns is always greater or equal to the support of each of these patterns For example having two infrequent patterns A and C  their support values are always greater or equal to the support value calculated for the rule A  C    Figure 2 Fitness function B Genetic Operators To obtain new individuals in every generation of the evolutionary process the proposal described in this paper uses two genetic operators crossover and mutation Crossover This genetic operators swaps the highest support condition in one parent for the lowest support condition in other parent Therefore this genetic operator enables us to obtain an individual whose conditions have a frequency of occurrence lower than at least one of the parents Mutation The main goal of this genetic operator is the discovery of rules with a lower support than the original one In such a way the highest support condition in an individual is mutated to obtain a new one with a lower support This genetic operator provides two possibilities 1 to obtain a new complete condition replacing the highest one or 2 to replace the value of a terminal symbol within the highest support condition C Algorithm The EA proposed follows a generational schema as depicted in Figure 3 Here a pool of individuals with a predeìned size is used The purpose of this pool is to maintain the best rules discovered in the evolutionary process In each generation this pool is updated with those individuals that exceed a minimum quality threshold i.e the tness function value must be greater than zero and the conìdence must be greater than the minimum conìdence threshold In each generation once new individuals are obtained with the above described genetic operators individuals from the population and the last pool are united in a new auxiliary population and then they are ranked according to the conìdence measure As mentioned above only those individuals with a tness function distinct from zero are kept in mind The main objective is to fullìll the pool i.e to select the n more reliable individuals n being the maximum pool size as previously set by the data miner The algorithm proposed avoids to keep in the pool those individuals that 88 2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing 


 Start Generate individuals   Evaluate individuals Individuals are selected as parents and then crossed and mutated with a probability The new individuals, the population and the pool are combined into a new single population Individuals are ranked using confidence The updating process includes the best individual in Pool Pool is initialized individuals reached Yes No Algorithm finished End Return the pool Yes Evaluate individuals No Context-free grammar Figure 3 The owchart for the proposed algorithm represent the same rule Notice that the same rule could be represented by different genotypes e.g the rules  A AND B   C and  B AND A   C  Both rules provide different genotypes even when they represent the same rule Therefore a speciìc procedure is carried out to guarantee that the pool of individuals contains distinct infrequent rules i.e those that are the most reliable ones Starting from a new rule to be added to the pool this procedure analyses each condition within the rule checking if there is a rule in the pool that comprises the same conditions Finally once the number of generations is reached the algorithm nishes and the pool of individuals is returned the best rules discovered in the evolutionary process are given to the data miner III E XPERIMENTAL S TUDY In this section a complete analysis of the effectiveness of this proposal compared to other existing proposals for mining rare association rules is carried out All the experiments in these studies were performed on an Intel Core i7 machine with 12GB main memory and running CentOS 5.4 In addition all the proposals for mining rare association rules were written in Java JCLEC 1  a J a v a library for the evolutionary computation was used in the proposal presented in this paper A Experimental set-up In the experimentation stage and in order to analyse the performance of our proposal a set of executions were performed using different datasets which were chosen with 1 JCLEC is available for download from http://jclec.sourceforge.net different sizes and number of attributes automobile performance dataset  Autom  with 392 instances and 8 numerical attributes vote dataset  Vote  with 435 instances and 17 categorical attributes Wisconsin breast cancer dataset  WDBC  with 683 instances and 11 numerical and categorical attributes and nally zoo dataset  Zoo  with 102 instances and 17 categorical attributes It is noteworthy that since exhaustive search algorithms in this eld require an enormous computational time they are hardly maintainable when using huge datasets comprising large amount of attributes so not very large datasets are used in this experimental stage Since evolutionary proposals have a set of parameters such as population size pool size number of generations crossover probability mutation probability maximum support threshold and minimum conìdence threshold we have carried out a number of experiments in order to obtain the optimal parameters i.e those that allow us to obtain the best results The parameter conìguration was adopted after performing several tests using different rank values for each parameter Notice that these parameters are not particularized for every dataset The best results for our approach are obtained with a population size of 50 individuals obtained using a CFG with a maximum derivation size of 24 The evolutionary process is carried out along 50 generations In this process new individuals are obtained with a probability of 0.70 for the crossover operator and 0.14 for the mutator The best individuals i.e those that exceed certain quality thresholds are kept in a pool of size 20 These thresholds are 0.90 and 0.40 for the conìdence and the maximum support respectively On the other hand exhaustive search algorithms for mining rare association rules only require two parameters the support and conìdence thresholds In order to carry out a fair comparison the algorithms used in the experimental stage are executed with the same conìdence threshold i.e 0.90 for the conìdence and a support threshold of 0.40 B Comparing different algorithms In this section a comparison between existing exhaustive search algorithms and the proposal based on the CFG is carried out A major advantage of the proposal presented in this paper is the ability of discovering rare association rules without requiring any preprocessing step With a simple grammar transformation it is possible to extract rules over any domain and using different logic operators Since the new proposal can be executed over original datasets Figure 4 shows a set of rare association rules mined using the original Wisconsin breast cancer dataset As is shown very reliable rare association rules are discovered For a fair comparison and since existing proposals for mining rare association rules use an exhaustive search methodology over categorical datasets only those that comprise numerical attributes were previously preprocessed

time is not uniform but depends directly on the dataset used For instance using ARIMA the execution time may vary from 293 to 11113 seconds On the contrary the use of an evolutionary strategy allows of mining rules in a uniform period of time at most one second regardless of the dataset used As it is depicted in Table IV the shortcoming of exhaustive search algorithms is overcomed by the new proposal obtaining rare association rules in a signiìcantly better execution time for most datasets IV C ONCLUSION The mining of rare association rules has not been studied in depth and existing algorithms in this eld mainly use exhaustive search methods This methodology is the main drawback of these algorithms which are hardly maintainable specially when using huge datasets comprising a large number of attributes Additionally these algorithms obtain rare association rules only over categorical domains so numerical values must be discretized rst In this paper a grammar-based evolutionary proposal for mining reliable rare association rules was presented In this proposal each individual is represented as a treestructure based on a CFG which provides expressiveness and exibility and allows both categorical and numerical attributes to be deìned Since most existing proposal for mining association rules and particularly rare association rules are based on exhaustive search methodologies the use of grammars provides a number of advantages Grammars allow to constraint the search space reducing the search cost necessary to nd solutions Furthermore the use of an evolutionary solution allows of decreasing the computational time Finally it should be noted that the proposal presented in this paper does not divide the mining process into two steps i.e the rst one for mining patterns and the second one for mining rules among the patters mined previously as the exhaustive search models do Focusing on how many rules are mined regardless of the dataset used the number of rules returned is close to the size speciìed by the data miner These results show that the proposal discovers a small set of rules unlike the existing algorithms which obtain some huge sets of rare association rules resulting in a collection that is hardly understandable Finally the execution time tends to be constant in oposition to exhaustive search algorithms where a vast amount of time is required A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been supported by the Regional Government of Andalusia and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology projects P08-TIC-3720 and TIN2008-06681C06-03

B.  NFUP algorithm The basic idea of NFUP algorithm is similar to the FUP algorithm. Their difference is shown in follows: FUP algorithm using the original database to set DB mining results, that is frequent items Ls need for DB and db scan for n times, getting final frequent items L' of DBdb; And algorithm NFUP just scan DB for one time and db for several times. NFUP algorithm can improve efficiency by less scanning to DB's I/O operations. Apriori algorithm for db verifies whether the elements of L is he frequent item of dbDB, and generates the frequent items Ldb, then verifies whether elements of Ldb is the frequent items of dbDB through scanning of DB However, the premise of NFUP algorithm is frequent items known metadata DB and the support of elements Therefore, the theoretical NFUP efficiency is far more than that of FUP. In order to compare the two algorithms, the actual operation comparison will be shown in below. Hardware environment: the CPU is Intel p4 2.4 GHz; memory is DDR 1.0 GB. Software environment: Windows 2000 Server operation system, a programming language is Matlab 7.1. The original data DB exist in Boolean matrix form, which is nine project including 10 000 record. The new data base has 500 records \(about 850 KB and FUP is shown in figure 1, minimum support degree in the 20 percent and 80 percent    Figure 1 The comparison of the execution time among same database algorithms From figure 1, for the same database and support circumstances, the execution time of NFUP algorithm is reduced by 50% than FUP algorithm. NFUP algorithm is much fast than FUP algorithm when the support degree in 0.2 and 0.6 V.  CONCLUSIONS Now some algorithm of some existing frequent items has some missed questions, such as many candidate items, big space. The algorithm may reduce the mining efficiency when increasing scan db frequent items. Although algorithm is simple, its process carries on more effective pruning. This paper brings in some knowledge about association rule

Frequency Module This module aims at detecting the frequent instances and the frequent associations of instances. Indeed, such a frequency depicts an important interest of the user for the concerned instances. Consequently, it is relevant to recommend items with these characteristics to the user 1 considers the profile of the user. It aims at detecting the most important features of interest for the user Regardless of the estimated interest of an instance for a user, we consider that if the user has in his history a significant percentage of items which have as a feature that particular instance, the interest of this instance is significant Unlike the previous computation, this computation ignores the users ratings for the items which have the instance as a feature Example: A user who has watched 80% of the films interpreted by the actor Tom Hanks should get the recommendation of the other 20% he has not seen even if some of the films of Tom Hanks in his history are badly rated 2 case with frequent instances described above, this part of the module deals not only with the profile of the user, but also with the set of items. It aims at discovering frequent associations between the features in the user history. It detects the features that often occur together in order to discover new recommendations. To achieve this, frequent sets of the instances related to the items in the users history are computed. Then, items with such instances are recommended to the user Example: A possible frequent association is the actor Johnny Depp and the director Tim Burton. A user who is interested in these two instances will be recommended the other films related to them E. Recommendation and explanation 


As explained in Sect. II, the collaborative and the semantic modules are in cascade. Consequently, the result is a set of recommendations rec1 which is mixed with the recommendations of the frequency module rec2 such that rec1 is presented before rec2 to the user. This order can be inverted according to user feedback. Concerning the explanation of the recommendations, this is done by highlighting the instances which have highly scored the interest of the user for the items of rec1, and by highlighting the frequent instances in the items of rec2 F. Example In this section, we illustrate the recommendation process for any user u, in the movie domain. We will simplify to preserve the clarity of the example 2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications 473 Table I EXTRACT OF THE PROFILE OF THE USER u Film Rating Transformation Psycho 5 Psychol Rear Window 4 Rear Windowl Four Weddings and a Funeral 4 Four Weddings and a Funerall Monty Pythons Life of Brian 5 Monty Pythons Life of Brianl Carrie 3 Carried Stephen Kings The Langoliers 1 Stephen Kings The Langoliersd Pulp Fiction 4 Pulp Fictionl Dr. Strangelove 2 Dr. Strangeloved A Clockwork Orange 1 A Clockwork Oranged Let us consider u who has rated the movies in Tab.

The concerned movies are The Shining and Monty Python and the Holy Grail For The Shining, we obtain the following interest re 


sults conceptInterestActor \(u, TheShining conceptInterestDirector \(u, TheShining conceptInterestWriter \(u, TheShining conceptInterestGenre \(u, TheShining Unlike the prediction of the previous modules, it seems that The Shining is not a good recommendation for u Actually, this film shares its director with Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange which are negatively rated by u Moreover, it has a writer in common with Carrie and The Langoliers which are also movies disliked by u. The same reasoning is made about the concepts Actor and Genre Concerning Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the interests by concept are conceptInterestActor \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestDirector \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestWriter \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestGenre \(u, HolyGrail This recommendation is a good one. The film shares its actors, writers and director with Monty Pythons Life of Brian which is highly rated by the user. The recommendation is thus justified Figure 3. Extract of the movie ontology Frequency Module: Let us assume that the user rated 60% of Alfred Hitchcocks films \(in Tab. I, Psycho and Rear Window are some of them recommended to u IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION A. Ontology Description For the experimentation, we built the ontology manually see Fig. 3 IMDB8. We focused only on a set of data which led to the concepts Film, Person, Actor, Director, Writer and Genre The connections between these concepts are Each movie is related to a certain number of persons who can be actors, directors or writers but it can also be related to other movies \(Example: Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home and Free Willy 3: The Rescue are related A person and a movie have a genre \(Action, Adventure Animation, Children, Comedy, Crime, etc B. Experimentation and Evaluation 


We use a subset of the dataset provided by MovieLens, the recommender system of GroupLens Research. The dataset contains a set of users, the set of items they have evaluated with a rating between 1 \(for the least liked for the most liked framework, we deal with a set of 86 movies, 934 users and 13 053 ratings. The dataset contains 3593 actors, 77 directors, 275 writers and 17 genres Using a 65% confidence and a 5% support, association rule mining resulted in 1472 rules after running the collaborative module. We evaluated the results obtained from the system by eighteen 20-50-year-old volunteers. The evaluation consisted exclusively in explicit valuations \(ratings 8http://www.imdb.com 474 2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications Figure 4. Users evaluation of the system between 1 and 5 rated at the beginning between 11 and 31 films. For each recommended item, the user rates it as liked or disliked. If an item is rated as liked, the recommendation is considered as accurate. Otherwise, the system explains the reason why this item is recommended. The user can then agree with this explanation or not. Explanation of recommendation can be effective in convincing users in their appreciation of the items [24]. In our approach, the explanation aims at discovering if the detected patterns in the recommended item are accurate or not. Let us consider the following explanation in the recommendation of a film: This film may interest you because you frequently watched Tim Burtons films with Johnny Depp. If the user agrees with the explanation, that means that the association \(Tim Burton - Johnny Depp relevant but this particular film do not appeal to the user Otherwise, we consider that the detected association was purely a coincidence. In this case, the system will be able to ignore this pattern for this user in the future The results of this evaluation are depicted on Fig. 4. We can see that 84,9% of the recommendations satisfy the users Concerning the recommendations rated as disliked, 59,4% of the explanations are approved by users. Finally, 93,9% of the recommendations are satisfying or approved An average of 5 recommendations is obtained by running the collaborative and the semantic-based modules \(which is 


acceptable due to the low number of movies  86  in the dataset frequency module. This difference is due to the fact that the cascading modules \(collaborative and semantic-based are limited by the unique usage of the ratings to compute the association rules. The frequency module, on the other hand, is based on a statistical analysis of the item contents Consequently, it does not suffer from the sparsity of the user rating matrix like the previous modules The collaborative module results in some recommendations which are not liked by users. Fortunately, such recommendations are eliminated by the semantic-based module Other recommendations are eliminated by the semanticbased module though they appeal to users. We explain this because the concerned items dont share any features with the ones in the users history. This is why, we aim at introducing a semantic similarity measure to alleviate this problem \(see Sect. V module recommendations and 58,1% of the explanations of the disliked recommendations, satisfy the users. We can conclude that the combination of all the modules results in better recommendations V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In our work, we propose a hybrid recommender system that combines collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of the items. The approach is based on many modules that refine the rules which progressively lead to a recommendation. A process targeting users with various interests is described. First, the collaborative filtering step is achieved using association rule mining which is a flexible way to classify the user. His history is then used to make the results more adapted to him. The semantic module aims at refining the recommendation issued from the rules. Finally, a frequency module is used to discover other items of interest for the user. Using distinct modules allows us to explain the recommendations to the user The results we have obtained from the evaluation experiments are promising. The combination of the collaborative and semantic modules improves the quality of the recommendations and the frequency module adds new ones. 93,9 of the recommendations are satisfying or approved In near future, we aim at defining the approach to learn 


the user profile in order to adapt the combination of the recommendation modules. We also plan to improve the semantic module by defining the semantic similarity between instances [25], [26]. Thus, when computing the interest by instance, those which are semantically similar to the current instance can be used when the instance is not present in the users history This similarity could also be used during the personalization of the association rules. The personalization rule \(a which consists in only keeping the rules which have a body composed of items contained in the users history, can be relaxed if the items violating \(a the items in the users history. The advantage of the semantic similarity is that it can be computed off-line which does not slow down the recommendation process Another improvement we want to introduce is the use of implicit data collected and based on the users behavior e.g. his search history, the time he spent looking at an item and his navigational patterns. This will help to increase the knowledge about the user and, in turn, lead to a better understanding of his expectations Finally, we plan to experiment the framework on other domains to confirm the domain-independence of the system REFERENCES 1] G.
