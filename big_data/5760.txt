has shifted from being an exercise of theory and computation to become the exploration of an ocean of observational data Scientists explore data originated from modern scientiìc instruments in order to discover interesting aspects of it and formulate their hypothesis Such workloads press for new database functionality We aim at sampling scientiìc databases to create many different impressions of the data on which the scientists can quickly evaluate exploratory queries However scientiìc databases introduce different challenges for sample construction compared to classical business analytical applications We propose adaptive weighted sampling as an alternative to uniform sampling With weighted sampling only the most informative data is being sampled thus more relevant data to the scientiìc discovery is available to examine a hypothesis Relevant data is considered to be the focal points of the scientiìc search and can be deìned either a priori with the use of functions or by monitoring the query workload We study such query workloads and we detail different families of weight functions Finally we give a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of weighted sampling Keywords Scientiìc Data Management Sampling I I NTRODUCTION Scientiìc discovery has shifted from being an exercise of theory and computation to become the exploration of an ocean of observational data This transformation was identiìed by Jim Gray as the 4th paradigm of scientiìc discovery State-of-the-art observ atories digital sensors and modern scientiìc instruments produce every day petabytes of information This scientiìc data is stored in massive datacenters for later analysis From the data management viewpoint the capture curation and analysis of data are not computation-intensive processes any more but a dataintensive ones The explosion in the amount of scientiìc data presents a new stress test for database systems design Meanwhile the scientists are confronted with new questions how can relevant and compact information be found from such a ood of data The predominant answer given by the data management community is the raw power of big datacenter installations complemented by new technologies focusing on scalable distribution of data and operations When it comes to curating and analysing vast amounts of data one can hardly argue that another approach is feasible However scientiìc discovery implies also a more delicate and reìned task that of forming the scientiìc question a hypothesis to be later tested for correctness Such formations of scientiìc questions or hypotheses as well as the initial proof-ofvalidity constitute an ad-hoc exploratory scientiìc query workload  During an iterative and interactive query session the scientists pose queries in order to examine the nature of the stored data discover interesting aspects of it formulate their hypotheses but also test the syntactical correctness of their queries Exploratory scientiìc workloads press for new database functionality Scientists are interested in an initial educative answer without having to spend too many valuable resources Nevertheless it is necessary to provide bounds on the quality of the answer and limit the execution time  5 Our approach to this ne w challenge is sampling the database to create many different snapshots of the data called impressions  on which the scientists can evaluate their queries Impressions come in various sizes and are organised in a multi-layer hierarchical manner The size of an impression determines both the quality of the result and the time spent on query processing The rule of thumb is the smaller an impression the faster an answer will be given while the bigger an impression is the better the quality of the answer will be With such a collection of impressions  accompanied by a bounded query execution engine we envision a complete framework for scientiìc data management with bounds on runtime and quality This framework serves the purpose of data-intensive scientiìc discovery Once a scientiìc hypothesis is formulated and a correct set of queries is written the scientist may then validate his ndings over the entire dataset In this work we are concerned with the problem of how to create and maintain samples to be used in impressions The predominant technique in the literature is uniform sampling over the data However scientiìc databases introduce different properties for sample construction compared to classical business analytical applications For starters a scientiìc search can be more focused drilling into details while a business strategy is made by observing general trends along the breadth of the data Accurately answering focused queries stresses existing sampling methods Secondly datatype domains are different Scientiìc data has many double precision values often with strong skew On the other hand classical OLAP applications usually have predeìned categorical data types with low cardinality e.g product type country etc Another difference of scientiìc discovery is 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 300 


that group-by and aggregations such as average and sums are less common In fact most of the research in sampling presents solutions on overcoming errors introduced by rare high values that throw the estimations off track or by very small group that wonêt appear in a sample We propose using weighted sampling as an alternative to uniform sampling Our goal is to get the most out of scientiìc data by sampling only the interesting parts For a given statistical test the power of the test can always be increased by increasing the sample size Clearly with larger sample sizes the probability of accepting a hypothesis is increased as the sample size increases Weighted sampling increases the sample size around areas of interest Thus although the total resources dedicated to sample storage is constant queries that target areas of interest give better approximated answers and with higher conìdence levels The areas of interest are deìned as the focal points of the scientiìc search It can be a priori deìned e.g interest only on spikes in the data or it can be observed during a query session Once the focal points have been established a weight is assigned to each newly ingested tuple This is done with the help of weight functions  which can also be adaptive to any changes of focal points over time With adaptive weighted sampling queries are answered faster are less error prone and fewer physical resources are used II R ELATED WORK Sampling is an important database operation primarily used for extracting statistical information over the data without the need for accessing the entire base Fundamental work on database sampling is due to Olken and Rotem The typical usage of samples in modern data management systems is to provide an estimation of the result size  9 which is then used by the cost model of a query optimiser or to facilitate approximate query answering 11 Biased sampling has been used in the past for nonuniform sampling methods based on weight functions  sample selection 12 to answer approximate queries is motivated by ad hoc exploratory data analysis but in a business analytic environment In such a setting the data is explored in a breadth search manner looking for global trends as opposed to scientiìc application where a scientist searches in depth focusing into the details Congressional samples are also constructed for answering approximate group-by queries This technique is also known to the literature as stratiìed sampling 14 Concise and Counting sampling techniques include the number of occurrences of a value on the sample 16 treats the results of a query as being newly appended tuples that should be sampled thus forcing frequently appearing results to be more likely to be part of the sample.BlinkDB uses samples to achieve interactive query execution times over a distributed environment by extending the Hive/HDFS execution stack III S CIENTIFIC W ORKLOAD A NALYSIS To improve the way scientists can explore large science datawarehouses a much better understanding of their query interaction is needed Unfortunately little is known publicly to guide us A notable exception is the SDSS Skyserver DR7 database which contains astronomy data We study its publicly accessible query logs to extract query patterns Skyserver contains data for over half a billion sources A source in astronomy is any object in the sky that omits energy for example a star or a nebula Every source is identiìed in the database with a unique id and can be located by its position in the sky The position is marked with two coordinates the right ascension  ra  and the declination  dec  We study the queries red against the Skyserver DR7 over the span of one month The total number of queries logged is 1,242,767 and originated from 2,646 distinct IP addresses Out of all queries 402,108 queries had an unknown origin so could not be associated with a speciìc user The 50 most active users accounted for over 90 of the remaining workload 774,924 queries An interesting side observation is the increased number of queries originating from crawlers of known search engines indexing the so called deep web  Our goal is to identify patterns in the queries posed by the scientists over time We consider the coordinates ra and dec to be a natural choice of attributes to plot since they correspond to the area in the sky that an astronomer looks at Due to lack of space we next show the query habits of only four  but representative  users They are all either astronomy observatories or research institutes and universities from Asia Europe and America Figure 1 depicts the querying habits of these representative users Each query searches for sources over an area that Skyserver covers We plot the values of ra and dec as given in the queries predicates In addition we add a third dimension that shows the exact sequence these queries were red We plot 4 graphs for each user i  a 3-d plot that in the x-axis shows the time sequence of the queries and in the zand yaxis the ra and dec respectively ii  the ra over the query sequence iii  the dec over the query sequence and iv  the ra and dec  The top left user of Figure 1 purple colour scans over the entire Skyserver many times throughout the query sequence For this user a uniform sample may serve his needs better The next user seen in the top right corner of Figure 1 yellow colour scans over the same stripes of data over and over throughout the span of the entire month His queries are very concentrated on selected areas of interest Similarly the next user shown on the left lower corner of Figure 1 green colour is interested in three narrow areas of the Skyserver and for a small period of time Finally the last user shown on the right lower corner of Figure 1 blue colour exhibits an exploratory query pattern where the focal point is constantly moving towards a more limited area 301

t even if it is a combination of many attributes i.e w  t  w  t.A t.B t.C      We present three families of weight functions to address different application requirements The rst set of functions are data independent the second data dependent and the third query dependent A Data Independent Weight Functions In many scientiìc applications the latest observations are of most interest For example in seismographic monitoring the earthquakes of the last 24 hours or the last week is the focal point of the seismologists Another example are the latest measurements for the meteorologists Therefore it can be useful to maintain a sample that contains the latest events For example given the query SELECT  FROM Events AS ev WHERE ev.timestamp current_timestamp  INTERVAL 24 hours a weighted sample created such that most of the past 24 hour events are included will give a more informative and complete result than a uniform sample We deìne the following data independent weight function  that adds more weight to the latest events Deìnition 2 Given a tuple t  and a sample S of size s a data independent weight function w ls that chooses the latest appended tuples over the older ones is deìned as w ls  t  k  D where D is a parameter that deìnes the size of the timeframe for the latest events and k  s is the ratio of latest over older events to be included in the sample S If D<s then w ls  t   that is all new tuples are included on the sample More speciìcally D is equal to the expected amount of tuples to be inserted in the database during the timeframe of interest For example if we are interested in the earthquakes that took place on the last 24 hours and there are on average 1000 events recorded per day then D is set to 1000 or more Similarly if we are interested in events of the last week then D is set to 7000 and so on Assuming that the size of the sample is s  we set the parameter k to be equal to s if the applicationês interest is on only new events Otherwise if k<n then there will be k latest events in the sample and n  k older events on average By tuning k we can set the ratio between old and new events in the sample We refer to this family of weight function as latest seen  or ls for short This application of weighted sampling is particular useful for examining the latest observations or for grabbing the newest additions in the database and forwarding them to third parties B Data Dependent Weight Functions Weight functions that depend on the data are the most generic ones The goal of such functions is to apply lters to the data Only tuples that satisfy these lters are eligible for sampling The existing VIEW infrastructure of relational databases often allows the deìnition of such ltering For example an SQL statement CREATE VIEW name AS SELECT  FROM PhotoObj WHERE ra  180 will create a view containing only sources that have ra smaller than 180 A uniform sample over such a view will produce the desired result However the same effect can be achieved with a simple weight functions of the form w  t   1 if t ra  180 0 otherwise Nevertheless data dependent weight functions can have more complicate expressions and multiple weights compered to what can be achieved with existing relational database functionality A generic multi-part data dependent weight function can be deìned as follows Deìnition 3 Given a tuple t and with attributes A,B,C a multi-part data dependent weight function is deìned as w m  t           w 1 if expr 1  t  w 2 if expr 2  t     0 otherwise such that at most one of expr 1  expr 1  can be true Besides these generic data dependent weight functions more specialised functions are necessary for certain applications In scientiìc applications more often than usual scientists are interested in the outliers rather than the average value distribution This demand is entirely opposite from traditional application where outliers are considered bad cases and need to be avoided because they can drastically alter the result of an approximated answer In scientiìc exploration however outliers may be of the utmost importance For example in seismic data a big earthquake is much more important than the many small regular earthquakes that repeatedly occur around the globe Similarly in astronomy objects that emit light in a high spectrum are more suitable for observation For this reasons we deìne a family of weight functions that assign heavier weights to tuples that are further from the usual observed values We refer to these functions as z-weight because they are inspired by the standard score z for identifying outliers Deìnition 4 Given a tuple t and an attribute t.A such that we are interested in its outlier values the z weight function is deìned as w z  t   t.A     where  is the mean of the values of attribute t.A and  the standard deviation 303 


Essentially the z weight function assigns a higher weight to values deviating more from the mean The distance from the mean is then divided by the standard deviation to overweight the outliers If  t.A      that is if the value of the attribute is between the expected deviation from the mean then w z  t   1  otherwise w z  t   1  In order to calculate the w z function both the mean and the standard deviation of the values of t.A are needed These can be easily computed during the loading phase with the use of an online algorithm such as the one detailed in Finally  in order to increase the probability of more outliers to be sampled and less of the common values the numerator of the fraction t.A     can be squared as many times as needed In the experimental evaluation we show results also for the cases of  t.a    2  and  t.a    4   C Query Dependent Weight Functions Query dependent weight functions are steered by the observed userês interest in the data The interest is monitored by rst identifying the attributes of the data that contain relevant scientiìc observational values rather than annotations or metadata Then by storing  typically in a histogram  the values that appear in the predicates of the query workload We can then deìne a weight function that promotes those tuples that satisfy more often the predicates of the workload More speciìcally the predicate set is deìned to be all the values of the interesting attributes that are requested by the queries These values are regarded as points that suggest the entire distribution of values of interest Therefore weighted sampling should follow that distribution instead of the distribution of the stored values which would have been the case of uniform sampling A histogram H over the predicate set is maintain by increasing the counter of the bin that a value falls into.qGiven a histogram H the following query dependent weight function w q is deìned Deìnition 5 Given a tuple t and a histogram H build over the predicate set the query dependent weight function w.q is deìned as w q  t  H  i  c where i is the bin of the histogram H that tuple t falls into and c is the counter of that bin We can also normalise the weight of tuple t in order to be smaller than 1 The normalise weight w  q w  q  w q  t    i 1 H  i  c  Intuitively the probability of sampling tuple t is equal with the percentage of the total surface of the distribution of the predicate set it covers The more queries have predicates that fall in a bin the more likely is that a tuple of that bin is sampled If the predicates are not equalities but ranges then the counters of all bins that fall into that range are increased by one 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350  right ascension uniform sample 0 50 100 150 200  purple user workoad weighted sampling 0 50 100 150 200  orange user workoad weighted sampling 0 50 100 150 200 count green user workoad weighted sampling 0 50 100 150 200  blue user workoad weighted sampling Figure 2 Query dependent weighted sample V E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION In our experimentation we wish to examine the behaviour of the different families of the proposed weight functions and their effectiveness in query answering For this we used the data and query logs of Skyserver as described in Section III The data of Skyserver have been mirrored locally and loaded to the MonetDB database system The realisation of Skyserver in MonetDB uses over 2.6 terabytes of disk space excluding the indexes All algorithms for weighted sampling including the proposed extensions for SQL were implemented as part of the MonetDB system The rst set of experiments study the properties of the weighted samples created with the query dependent weight functions We build the histograms needed over the predicate set as given by the query workload of the four users in Section III To emulate the process of regular ingests of data we loaded the tuples of the PhotoObj relation of Skyserver with an append procedure in batches The entire process of loading all tuples takes just over 20 minutes for a total of 500 million tuples The loading time for each batch shows no noticeable variation with or without the creation of an impression This is due to the lightweight implementation of the reservoir algorithm The execution is performed by a separate thread which renders the sampling overhead unnoticeable compared to the time spent on parsing 304

over PhotoObj with parameters D 10  000  000 and k 5  000  while the size of the sample is set to be 10,000 Figure 4 depicts the state of both the uniform and the weighted sample after the load of the rst 10 million tuples and after the load of the last batch of tuples The total number of tuples in the end is over 500 million The uniform samples are shown on the upper plots of Figure 4 and the last-seen weighted samples at the lower part The uniform sample always resembles the distribution of ra values found in PhotoObj after each append of the next 10 million tuples Thus at the end of the loading process the uniform samples is exactly like the one shown in the bottom plot of Figure 2 However at the start of the process the uniform sample resembles only the distribution of the ra values loaded up until that point For the last-seen weighted sample the story is different Given that this sample includes only the last 5000 tuples that have been appended and 5000 from the previous loads the resulting distribution is much different Notice that D is set to be equal to 10 million since that is the size of the batches of tuples that we append In the left lower plot of Figure 4 it is shown that although the weighted sample has a spike around the value 230 of ra  there are still some remaining tuples between 0 to 50 and 150 to 250 They are the remaining tuples of the previous appends That is since k  5000 and the size of the sample is s  10000  it follows that there should be about 5000 new tuples and 5000 older ones The plots of the last-seen weighted sample have similar properties for all the consecutive batch appends At the end the weighted sample only contains tuples from the last append as shown on the right lower plot of Figure 4 The spikes in the value distribution have moved to the values from the last tuples of the last batch VI C ONCLUSIONS Sampling is an important operation of a database system It is used for approximating query results for advising query planers and for maintaining indexes In this paper we propose a new use for sampling that of reìning a database into smaller parts called impressions  This reìnement allows faster evaluation of focused queries by examining only the relevant data For this we proposed weighted sampling as an alternative to uniform We have described three different families of weight functions To support our approach we analysed the data and query logs obtained by a realworld scientiìc application namely Skyserver Finally we have shown experimentally that weighted sampling is more suitable for choosing those speciìc areas of the data that better answer focused query workloads such as those found in the scientiìc discovery paradigm The future challenge is to redesign the execution engine around bounded query execution that employs impressions to improve performance under user-deìned error bounds and execution times using multiple differently sized impressions R EFERENCES  T  He y  S T
