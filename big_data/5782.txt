An action rule is constructed as a series of changes or actions, which can be made to some of the flexible characteristics of the information system that ultimately triggers a change in the targeted attribute. The existing 
action rules discovery methods consider the input decision system as their search domain and are limited to expensive and ambiguous strategies. In this paper, we define and propose the notion of action table as the ideal search domain for actions, and then propose a strategy based on the FPTree structure to achieve high performance in rules extraction Keywords- action rules; recommendation; association mining; action table; FP-Tree I   I NTRODUCTION  In association rule mining, the rules extracted from an information system are handed to the domain experts who need to filter what information is interesting or trivial Action rules were introduced in [3 as a n e w class o f ru l e  discovery that provides hints on possible actions a business should take to achieve a desired target Mining action rules is defined as the process of identifying patterns in a decision system capturing the 
possible changes to certain object attributes that may lead to a change in the decision value [3  G e n e ral ly act ion  ru le  mining operates on a decision system [13 i t h ob j ect s  having three classes of attributes: stable, flexible and decision. The stable attributes are attributes that cannot be changed or, in some approaches, require a prohibitive high cost to change them [4  Ex a m ples of s t a b l e  att ri bu tes a r e  the date of birth or weather conditions. Conversely flexible attributes are attributes on which the analysts have a certain degree of freedom in manipulating such as color sales percentage, and so forth. The decision is the attribute that the analyst would like to see changed; an example would be the profit of a company Existent action rules discovery methods use a decision table as their primary search domain; the employed strategies are limited to candidate generation-and-test. In our approach, the discovery of action rules is based on a 
domain of actions that we create from the decision system called the action table. The main contribution of this paper is to reformulate the action rules mining problem into the association-mining problem framework using the action table as the new search domain. A particularly suited approach is to use an FP-Tree structure to store the action table and the FP-Growth algorithm to extract association action rules The rest paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly surveys previous works on action rules mining Section 3 reviews the key concepts and definitions Sections 4 and 5 present the action table and our strategy through a detailed example. Finally we experimentally compare the performance of our solution with existent algorithms II  O VERVIEW AND RELATED WORK  Previous works on action rules assume a generalization 
of an information system S as introduced in [1  w h ere S   X, A, V   X: a nonempty, finite set of objects   A: a nonempty, finite set of attributes   V = {V a a 002 A} all the attributes values Additionally, a : X 003 V a is a function for any a 002 A that returns the value of the attribute of a given object. The attributes are divided into different categories: a stable set A st flexible set A fl and a decision set D of attributes where A= A st  004 A fl 004 D For example, Table I. represents a decision table with eight objects a 
is stable b and c are flexible d is the decision attribute TABLE I  E XAMPLE OF A DECISION TABLE   a b c d x1 a1 b1 c1 l x2 a2 b1 c1 l x3 a2 b2 c1 h

 In order to extract action rules, [3, 7, 8, 9, 10 w e r e  based on an existing set of classification rules. Certain pairs of these rules were combined to reclassify objects to a targeted state. One problem that arose, as argued in [4  is  some meaningful action rules should be missed in these classification-based techniques and thus existing algorithms cannot specify when and how the correct and complete underlying action rules are discovered  Instead they were the first to propose an inductive approach for mining directly from the decision system. The approach is formulated as a search problem based on a supportconfidence-cost framework and an Apriori-like algorithm

It considers the change in an attribute value as an atomic-action-term of length one, and then an action-term is a composition of atomicaction-terms. ARD starts by generating all atomic-actionterms for a given set of attribute values and assigning a mark \(unmarked, positive, negative\ based on support and confidence measures. The unmarked terms are placed into the candidate list. Next, it generates all possible actionterms of length two by combining terms in the candidate list and the atomic terms. The process continues iteratively, creating terms of greater length, until the candidates list is empty. The action-terms marked as positive are used to construct the action rules In [6  au th o r s p r es en te d an  a s s o ci ati on ty pe  of  ac ti on  rules and used an Apriori like strategy to find frequent action sets to induce action rules. Like ARD, the algorithm AAR \(Association Action Rule\considers atomic action sets being the fine granule used to construct longer rules similar to items and item sets in association mining\. The Apriori algorithm is directly used with few modifications the main changes are mostly driven \(a\ by modifications to the definition of support and confidence and \(b\y the calculation of the measures directly from the input decision system Although these approaches have different definitions for objective measures like support and confidence, they use the same idea of atomic-action set, action set and Standard Interpretation  III  P RINCIPLES OF ACTION RULES  In this section, we provide a quick overview of the key concepts in action rules literature.  We particularly focus on [6 as i t is th e m o s t  r ecen t w o rk on th e s u b j e c t an d i s  the most related to this work in the sense that both try to map association rules mining into action rules mining A  Atomic action set Defined as the expression a a1\002a2\ where a is an attribute in A and a1, a2 are values of a If the attribute is stable or did not change its value then the atomic action set is expressed as a a1\. The domain of an atomic action set is its attribute Dom a a1\002a2 a Example: Consider Rate a flexible attribute with values V rate 30%, 10%, 50%}. The atomic action set Rate  30 002 10%\eans changing the value of Rate from 30 to 10 B  Action sets Constructed as the conjunction of atomic action sets with the composition operator \(·\. If t1, t2 are two atomic action sets with different attributes, then t=t1· t2 is an action set. The domain of the action set t is the set of attributes from all its atomic action sets, here Dom t m\(t1 004 Dom\(t2  Example: Consider Age as  a stable attribute with values V age 25, 50, 70} and Credit a flexible attribute with values V credit good, bad}. An action set could be the composition Age 50   Rate 30 002 10   Credit  bad 002 good h ich cou ld be read as f o llo w s f o r customers of Age 50, change the Rate from 30% to 10 and the C redit from good to bad C  The standard interpretation \(noted Ns The introduction of the Standard Interpretation is the basis of measures like support and confidence. In association mining, the support of an itemset is simply the count of objects. For action rules, we need to consider two sets. The first set is all the objects with attributes value equal to the initial state of the action; the second set respectively, is all the objects having attributes values equal to the values of the final state of the action Example: The Standard interpretation of the action set Ns Age 50   Rate 30 002 10   Credit bad 002 good  A1,A2 Where A1= { x 001\031 X: age\(x\ = 50 005 rate\(x\0 005 credit\(x bad A2= { x 001\031 X: age\(x\ = 50 005 rate\(x\0 005  credit\(x\=good D  The support of an action set Assume t an action set with standard interpretation Ns t  A1  A2  h e s u pport Supp of t is considered in AAR as Supp t in{card\(A1\, card\(A2 In ARD as  Supp\(t\card\(A1 Hence, for AAR, for the two states, the support is concerned only with the state having the lowest occurrences.  For the ARD, it was only in terms of number of occurrences of the initial state. It should be noted that these definitions lead to very different results.  With respect to ARD, a rationale for the definition was not provided; however, the definition allows for A2 to be 0 and/or below minimum support. AAR, however, ensures that both A1 and A2 are guaranteed to satisfy the minimum support threshold E  Action rule An action rules r is expressed as r t1  002 t2  w h ere t 1  an d  t2 are two action sets. Typically t2 is the action comprising only the decision attribute Example Age 50   Rate 30 002 10   Credit  bad 002 good 002  Profit low 002 high The support is calculated similarly to action sets by considering the t1  t2 as an action set itself

F  The confidence measure The confidence of an action rule r=[t1 002 t2   Considering Ns\(t1\=[A1, A2 a nd N s t 2  Z1, Z2  w i t h  A1 and A2 not empty conf  r   card  A 1 006 Z 1 card  A 1  card  A 2 006 Z 2 card  A 2 1 In AAR, generating action rules is similar to association rule mining where frequent item sets are first extracted. The algorithm, which is based on Apriori generates actions sets with support that exceeds a specified threshold value: minimum support \(minSup\ any action set that meets this criterion is a frequent action set. An action rule is constructed and tested as following   If t is a frequent action set and t1 is a subset of t  then r =[ t  t1 002 t1    If Conf\(r\\003 minConf where minConf is the minimum confidence specified, r is a valid rule Like Apriori, the AAR method can generate a large number of rules.  The process does not constrain what the decision attribute may be; in fact, it does not even require a decision attribute to be specified.  As a side benefit unlike ARD, the user does not have to supply what the targeted decision should be.  For example, ARD would require the user to state \(Rate, 30%\00210%\ the decision of interest On the other hand, AAR suffers from two problems First, like Apriori, the number of rules may be overwhelming to the user.  Second, if the user is interested in a particular change, like \(Rate, 30%\00210%\ere is no guarantee that the AAR method will generate the required rules.  For instance, if minimum support is 8, and \(Rate 10%\ has a support of 5, then no rules containing \(Rate 10%\ would be generated As an aside, a justification of the defined confidence measure was provided for the ARD method.  In [5  th e  authors indicated that the definition of confidence should be considered as an optimistic confidence.  It requires that the card\(A1\ \0040, card\(A2\ \0040, card\(A1 006 Z1\ 0 and card\(A2 006 Z2\ \004 0.  In effect, this definition was required due to ARDs definition of support.  Without it, action rules could be generated that for cases in which A2 006 Z2 never occurred Interestingly, for AAR, a similar claim was made.  In 6   th e def in i ti on  w a s de cla re d op tim is tic b ecau s e  card\(A1\0 and card\(A2\ \0040.  However, since AAR uses minSup, as long as minSup is greater than 0, it is guaranteed that card\(A1\0 and card\(A2\ \0040 IV  T HE A CTION TABLE  As mentioned previously, the AAR and ARD methods operate within the search space represented by the decision table; we refer to this as the information space.  As a result, the creation \(and tracking\ of the various flexible atomic action sets is intertwined with the action set generation. Hence, one would need to calculate the support of Rate 30%\nd Rate 10%\ first in order to obtain the support of Rate 30 002 10%\. This operation needs to be performed for all k iterations.  The first iteration generates frequent action sets composed of 1 element, the second iteration generated action sets composed of 2 elements and so forth.  For instance, assume you have stable attribute Gender with values {m,f}.  Then, to calculate the action set Gender f   Rate 10 002 30   on e w o u l d f i rs t n e e d  to calculate the support of Gender f Rate 10 an d   Gender  Rate 30 However, this could be avoided if, instead of working within the information space, we were able to work within an action space, where the possible flexible action mappings are already known and represented.  In this paper, this is done via the introduction of the action table The key idea is explicitly enumerating how each object in S can be converted from the undesired, or initial, state to the desired one, or final. That information can be captured as a set of action sets within a table called the action table This creates a limitation, compared to the AAR approach by requiring the targeted decision to be known before hand; this limitation, however, is similar to that required by the ARD approach For example, if we consider Table I as our decision table and the targeted decision is \(d l 001\027 h then   L={x 001\031 X: d\(x l i.e. all the objects with decision value l    H={x 001\031 X: d\(x h i.e all the objects with decision value h  The action table will contain the necessary action sets to move every object in L to an object in H. The action table will contain exactly card\(L\card\(H\action sets Each row in the action table reflects the necessary action sets for transforming an object from low l to high  h This operation is formalized as following 007 x 002 L, y 002 H: x\002y is a possible transition describing a new action set t and 007 a 002 A   If a is flexible and a\(x\ a\(y\: a t a\(x\\002a\(y   If a is stable and a\(x\ a\(y\, then a\(t\ is contradicting and is therefore discarded   y\, then a t a\(x Example To generate the action table we start from the decision Table I and organize it into two subtables, as shown in table II, with respect to the decision attribute d  TABLE II  T HE D ECISION TABLE ORGANIZED WITH RESPECT TO THE DECISION ATTRIBUTE D   a b c d L x1 a1 b1 c2 l x2 a2 b1 c1 l x5 a2 b1 c1 l x8 a1 b2 c2 l H x3 a2 b2 c1 h x4 a2 b2 c2 h x6 a2 b2 c1 h x7 a2 b1 c2 h  
400 


Then we make a cross product from L into H and construct the action sets for each transition. If there is a change in the stable attribute we simply discard it. This process results in table III TABLE III  T HE ACTION TABLE FOR THE TARGET  D  L 002 H   a b c x1\002x3 b1\002b2 c2\002c1 x1\002x4 b1\002b2 c2 x1\002x6 b1\002b2 c2\002c1 x1\002x7 b1 c2 x2\002x3 a2 b1\002b2 c1 x2\002x4 a2 b1\002b2 c1\002c2 x2\002x6 a2 b1\002b2 c1 x2\002x7 a2 b1 c1\002c2 x5\002x3 a2 b1\002b2 c1 x5\002x4 a2 b1\002b2 c1\002c2 x5\002x6 a2 b1\002b2 c1 x5\002x7 a2 b1 c1\002c2 x8\002x3 b2 c2\002c1 x8\002x4 b2 c2 x8\002x6 b2 c2\002c1 x8\002x7 b2\002b1 c2  Note: the atomic action set with the decision attribute d will always be \(d, l\002h\ and therefore would be redundant in the action table A  Implications of the Action Table First, unlike the original decision table, the action table now explicitly includes change values as part of the attribute definition. Second, the decision cardinality card d l 001\027 h}\ is equal to the number of rows in the action table. Third, the action table does not allow us to recover the individual counts of Z1 or Z2; nor, for that matter, the individual counts of A1 or A2.  This information is not needed, then support for t, where t=t1·t2 and t2 d l 001\027 h}, is given by Supp  t   card  A 1 006 Z 1  card  A 2 006 Z 2 2 This calculation can take place by performing a count count operation on the action table What is attractive about this definition is it is the same support measure used in the traditional Association Mining [14   Now, if we look at the confidence measure used in traditional Association Mining [14   w e see  conf  r   Supp  r  Supp  t 1 3 One potential problem arises if the traditional association mining confidence measure is utilized. While the support of the rule can be directly calculated from the action table, the Supp t1\ cannot be calculated from the action table. This is because the action table does not contain all occurrences of A1 and A2.  However, the support for A1 and A2 can be easily calculated from the decision table; a simple pass through the table, performing a basic count operation is required. More formally, the support of an action set t1 with standard interpretation Ns t1 A1, A2   Supp  t 1  card  A 1  card  A 2 4 V   T HE FAARM STRATEGY  Using the concept of action table and the resulting changes to support and confidence, we believe that any association-mining algorithm can be used to generate action rules. Here, we demonstrate the use of the FPGrowth algorithm [2 o g e n e r a te th e a c ti on  ru les  W e  cal l  the resultant approach FAARM \(Frequent Association Action Rule Mining The FP-Growth algorithm is a divide…and…conquer approach that is considered to be an order of magnitude faster than Apriori  It re l i es  on a s p ec ial tr ee d a ta  structure called FP-Tree[2 w h ich is  o b tain e d  b y o r d e rin g  the transaction attributes values by their frequency pruning those that do not meet a given minimum support and then inserting the transaction, or action sets in our case, into a tree. The result is a condensed data structure that avoids expensive database scans and is especially tailored for dense datasets [2   The same concepts of atomic action set, action set and Standard Interpretation are borrowed from previous work However, the definitions of support and confidence used are those introduce in section IV.A Now, we present FAARM, the proposed process of extracting action rules from  FAARM  M ETHOD  1  Specify the decision target 2  Generate all the atomic action sets from A 3  Calculate the frequency of each atomic set 4  Build the action table 5  Prune and reorder the action table 6  Build the FP-Tree from the action table 7  Run FP-Growth on the FP-tree a  Extract frequent action sets b  Build and test the action rules  To better explain our proposed FAARM strategy, we go through the example on the decision table described in Table I.

Then, using the support formula 4\ and the minimum support criteria, we can calculate the exact support of all the possible atomic action sets \(Table V TABLE IV  T HE FREQUENCY OF ATTRIBUTES IN V FOR THE ACTION d, l 001\027 h FROM THE DECISION TABLE IN ONE PASS   l h a1 2 0 a2 2 4 b1 3 1 b2 1 3 c1 2 2 c2 2 2 TABLE V  S UPPORT OF ALL ATOMIC ACTION SETS  MIN S UP   4   Atomic action set Support with regards to \(d, l\002h a,a1 0 \(Does not meet min support a,a2\ 8 b,b1 3 \(Does not meet min support b,b2 3 \(Does not meet min support b,b1\002b2\ 9 b,b2\002b1 1 \(Does not meet min support c,c1\ 4 c,c2\ 4 c,c1\002c2\ 4 c,c2\002c1\ 4  For a later use, the list of atomic action sets is ordered by descending support List b1 001\027 a2\ \(c1\,\(c2\, \(c1 001\027 c2\, \(c2 001\027 c1 4\ Generate the action table  see section IV for the example 5\ Prune and reorder the action table Once the action table is generated, we can use List to order action sets by descending support and remove atomic sets that does not meet the minimum support. This operation facilitates the creation of the FP-Tree  6\ Build the FP-Tree from the action table  Generating the action table and storing it in memory is expensive time and space complexity is O\(n 2 where n is the number of transactions; to alleviate the space complexity we propose to use the FP-Tree to store the table. To build the FP-Tree we insert each action set, from the ordered and pruned action table, into the tree using the atomic action sets as the nodes. Each time a node is inserted or reused we increment its local count. If the node has been inserted somewhere else in the tree we create a link to the last inserted one \(Figure 1  7a\ Extract Frequent action sets  FP-Growth receives an FP-Tree as an input and does its traditional job for extracting frequent patterns given minimum support criterion  7b\ Generating Association Action Rules  The following frequent action sets are extracted from the FPTree using the FP-Growth algorithm [2   t1  a a2 b b1\002b2 c c1 d  l\002h  Supp  t1 4=minSup t2  a a2 c c1\002c2 d l\002h Supp  t2 4=minSup Finally, we can easily construct the association action rules and check their confidence.

We also considered datasets used in previous action rules discovery literature namely Hepatitis [9 an d Nu rs ery  1 2   th e  d a tase ts c a n  b e  obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [1   Finally, we used the same classification \(Stable, Flexible Decision\ for the attributes as used in [9, 12   A  Description of the datasets A brief description of each dataset is provided in this section 1  Hepatitis dataset This dataset contains clinical data of patients affected by the Hepatitis disease. It has 155 records and 19 attributes, not including the decision attribute.  The attributes are decomposed into 2 stable attributes and 17 flexible attributes.  Each flexible attributes is composed 9 values or less; the majority are composed of only 2. The patients are classified into: Die, Live. Our target is to find rules to change the likelihood of this classification i.e targeted decision effect is  class die 001\027 live  
402 


2  Nursery dataset This dataset is composed of the evaluation forms of applications to nursery schools. The dataset has 12960 records and 8 attributes, not including the decision attribute. The attributes are decomposed into 4 stable attributes and 4 flexible attributes.  Each flexible attributes is composed of 3 values or less. Our target is to find rules to enhance the chances of having an application go from being not recommended to priority i.e. targeted decision effect is  rank not_recom 001\027 priority B  Experimental Methodology In order to achieve fair performance comparison, we have implemented a version of ARD and AAR with the following modifications   The same definition of support is used as in FAARM: using different definition led to different set of rules, which is expected, as using different definitions would results in different action sets to be discarded/kept   AAR: First, we initially prune atomic-sets of the class attribute that are different from our targeted decision. Second, we stop the Apriori iterations if none of the frequent action sets contains the targeted decision   Because the search space is different in the three algorithms \(N in AAR and ARD, N 2 in FAARM the final support value for an action set in AAR and ARD must be squared With these modifications, the three algorithms will now produce the same rules.  Thus, the purpose of this comparison is to determine which method, if any, is faster In particular, as action set generation is more expensive than rule generation, we examined the impact of changing the support value.  For this study, we use a minimum confidence threshold of 80% for all experiments C  Results The results in Figure 2 show that FAARM achieves better performances on both Hepatitis and Nursery datasets with both high and low support values. With FAARM generating the action table from the Nursery would take 4320\*\(4266\operations, these values are the number of records with status not_recom and status priority  respectively. This operation is expensive, but once generated and encoded, the FP-Tree could be mined quickly  AAR performs better on Hepatitis, mainly because of the lower number of candidates. ARD, on the other hand showed the worst performance. During the experiments we noticed that ARD was fast when finding shortest rules and slower finding longer rules.  Furthermore, ARD is very poor at finding a good stopping point; in fact, it actually goes through all the iteration phases \(the maximum number of iteration being the length of the transaction\ The reason is that, for each generation, there are always some candidates to test, even if a positive mark isnt achievable An interesting aspect is the extent of FP-Tree compression over the action table. Figure 4 shows the size of the FP-Tree constructed from the action table in the Nursery experiment with varying minimum support values. While the action table size is always 250Mb, the size of the FP-Tree is 3.5Mb even for very small minimum support. The size of the FP-Tree shrinks even further for increasing minimum support values and this is due to the pruning at this level   Figure 2  Speed comparison of FAARM, AAR and ARD extracting action rules on Hepatitis dataset with varying minimum support threshold  Figure 3  Speed comparison of FAARM, AAR and ARD extracting action rules on Nursery dataset with varying minimum support threshold

 Figure 4  Compression of the action table from Nursery dataset of size 250Mb into FP-Tree with varying minimum support values VII  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we propose the action table as the ideal search domain for action rules mining. The action table transforms the complex problem of finding action rules from a plain decision table, into finding action rules from an action table. As a result, the problem of action rules mining is reformulated into association-mining In practice, we applied FAARM on the Hepatitis and Nursery datasets and compared the results and performances with AAR and ARD. Although the space and time complexity associated with generating the action table are O\(n 2 experiments show that FAARM has a better execution time on relatively small dataset, over ARD and AAR Generating the action table directly into the FP-Tree could mitigate the space complexity associated with action table. As a future work, we propose to look at parallel implementation of Apriori and FP-Growth to test the scalability of using the action table with large datasets R EFERENCES  1  Z.

PERFORMANCE STUDY To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms, we have done extensive experiments on various kinds of datasets with different features. The experiments are based on a 2.4GMHz Pentium IV PC with 512MB main memory and 60 GB hard driver, running on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. All the programs are written in Microsoft/Visual C++6.0 The measured performance is algorithms execution time on the datasets with different minimum support threshold. The execution time only includes the disk reading time \(scan datasets output frequent patterns speed of disk writing A. Datasets and characteristics We use real world and synthetic data for our performance study. The basic characteristics of datasets are listed in the following The real world dataset called Retail is achieved from a retailing company. Retail contains products from various categories. There are 16469 items and 88162 transactions in the dataset. Each transaction consists of the products purchased by a customer at a time point. Its average transaction size and average maximal potentially frequent patterns size are 10.3 and 3. The size of this dataset is 4M The synthetic data sets which were used for the experiments were achieved from the online FIMI repository See the RUL: http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/. The data sets are T10I4D100K and T40I10D100K. In T10I4D100K, the average record size and average maximal potentially frequent patterns 


size are 10 and 4. In T40I10D100K, they are 40 and 10. The numbers of transactions in both two dataset are set to 100K There are exponentially numerous frequent patterns when the support threshold goes down B. Experimental results In order to mine the utility frequent patterns, we randomly generate the count of each item between 1 and 6. In fact, most items are in the low profit range, we synthetically generate utility values of each item from 0.01 to 10.00, using a log normal distribution. For instance, Fig.2 shows the distribution of the utility values of items in T10I4D100K 1432 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 N um be r o f i te m s Utility value  Figure 2.  Utility value distribution in T10I4D100K For selecting appropriate utility thresholds, we use the average transaction utility value to constraint the utility threshold instead of randomly choosing it. For example, in Table 1, where the average transaction utility value is 40. If the utility threshold is equal to 25%, it represents that ? = 10 40  25% =10 We compare the performance of Share-FPM with BUUFM [5], an up to date algorithm for utility frequent patterns 


mining. Fig.3 through Fig.5 show the performance curves of two algorithms on three datasets respectively. We can see that the Share-UFPM algorithm outperforms BU-UFM on all datasets, and the performance gap becomes significant when the minimum support threshold drops low enough 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 Ti m e S ec on ds  Minimum support \(%0 Share-UFPM BU-UFM Utility threshold=5  Figure 3.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we introduce a utility frequent pattern mining model based on a share strategy to find the combination of items with high frequencies and utilities. This model first find all patterns with a given minimum support threshold. In this step, a share strategy gives a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively, thereby dramatically reducing the cost of computation. And then all patterns that do not satisfy a minimum utility threshold are pruned The extension of our technique, for maintenance of the already mined utility frequent patterns when updating databases, is an interesting topic for future research REFERENCES 1] R.

the time needed for execution exceeded 100000 seconds Thus, from this analysis we see that FPrep, which uses FCM clustering, clearly outperforms the CLARANS and CURE based methods on the basis of speed. The execution times for CLARANS and CURE mentioned in fig. 7 and Table II do not include the time required to create fuzzy sets, and calculate the membership value  for each numerical data point in every fuzzy set for the numerical attribute under consideration. These times also do not take into account the time required to transform crisp numerical attributes to fuzzy attributes, and derive the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset The fuzzy partitions generated for each of the five numerical attributes for the USCensus1990raw dataset are shown in Table III. Coincidentally, generating three fuzzy partitions for each numerical attribute seemed a perfect fit In addition to the superior speeds achieved by FPrep, as illustrated in fig. 7 and Table II, Table III indicates the semantics and the quality of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. Moreover, the number of frequent itemsets generated by a fuzzy ARM algorithm \(like fuzzy ARMOR and fuzzy Apriori minimum support threshold, is illustrated in fig. 8   Fig. 7. Algorithm, numerical attribute comparison based on speed \(log10 seconds   Fig. 8. Number of frequent itemsets for various minimum support values  B. Results from Second Dataset We have also applied FPrep on the FAM95 dataset http://www.stat.ucla.edu/data/fpp transactions. Of the 23 attributes in the dataset, we have used the first 18, of which six are quantitative and the rest are binary. For each of the six quantitative attributes, we have generated fuzzy partitions using FPrep. A thorough analysis with respect to execution times, has already been performed on the USCensus1990raw dataset \(which is manifolds bigger in size than the FAM95 dataset both on the basis of number of transactions and number of unique values for numerical 


attributes dataset has been done solely to provide further evidence of the quality and semantics of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. The details of the same are in Table IV. In this case, the number of fuzzy partitions is different for different numerical attributes. Thus, the number and type of fuzzy partitions to be generated is totally dependent on the attribute under consideration. A graphical representation of the fuzzy partitions generated for the attribute Age has already been provided in fig. 5, and clearly shows the Gaussian nature of the fuzzy partitions. The nature and shapes of fuzzy partitions for the rest of the attributes are also similar. Last, the number of frequent itemsets generated for different minimum support values is illustrated in fig. 8  C. Analysis of Results With FPrep, we can analyze and zero in on the number and type of partitions required based on the semantics of the numerical attributes, which the methods detailed in [19 20] do not necessarily facilitate. Then, FPrep, backed by FCM clustering, takes care of the creating the fuzzy partitions, especially assigning membership values for each numerical data point in each fuzzy partition. In section 8.A we have already shown that FPrep is nearly 9 to 44 times faster than the CURE-based method, and 2672 to 13005 times faster than the CLARANS-based method. FPrep is not only much faster than other related methods, but also generates very high quality fuzzy partitions \(Table III and IV much user-intervention. We have created a standard way of representing any fuzzy dataset \(converted from any type of crisp dataset efficacy of the same is corroborated by the successful implementation of Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR on the fuzzy dataset \(converted from crisp version of FAM95 dataset an initial implementation of Fuzzy ARMOR, are very encouraging. FPrep, when used in conjunction with these fuzzy ARM algorithms, generates a pretty good number of high-quality frequent itemsets \(fig. 8 frequent itemsets generated for a particular minimum support is same, irrespective of the fuzzy ARM algorithm 


used IX. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have highlighted our methodology, called FPrep, for ARM in a fuzzy scenario. FPrep is meant for seamlessly and holistically transforming a crisp dataset into a fuzzy dataset such that it can drive a subsequent fuzzy ARM process. It does not rely on any non-fuzzy techniques and is thus more straightforward, fast, and consistent. It facilitates user-friendly automation of fuzzy dataset 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Age - 91 Hours - 100 Income3 4949 Income2 13707 Income1 55089 Ti m e lo g1 0 se co nd s Numerical Attribute - Number of Unique Values FCM CURE CLARANS 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500

This methodology involves two distinct steps, namely creation of appropriate fuzzy partitions using fuzzy clustering and creation of fuzzy records, using these partitions, to get the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset FPrep has been compared with other such techniques, and has been found to better on the basis of speed. We also illustrate its efficacy on the basis of quality of fuzzy partitions generated and the number of itemsets mined by a fuzzy ARM algorithm which is preceded by FPrep. This preprocessing technique provides us with a standard method of fuzzy data \(record that it is useful for any kind of fuzzy ARM algorithm irrespective of how the algorithm works. Furthermore, this pre-processing methodology has been adequately tested with two disparate fuzzy ARM algorithms, Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR, and would also work fine with other fuzzy ARM algorithm REFERENCES 1] Zadeh, L.

The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method

The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
