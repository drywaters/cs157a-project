I I NTRODUCTION This paper investigates the problem of jointly estimating the number of objects and their states from a 223nite set of observations In radar/sonar applications the objective is to locate the targets from radar/sonar detections 2 In spatial statistics applications for example agriculture and forestry it 
is of interest to study the underlying spatial distribution of points plants from point pattern observation extracted from aerial images 4 The major challenges in this estimation problem are

detection uncertainty each object may or may not generate an observation clutter observations are corrupted by spurious measurements clutter not originating from any object data association uncertainty there is no information on which object generated which observation This so-called multi-object estimation problem can be formulated in a Bayesian framework by modeling the hidden set of states and set of observations as random 223nite sets RFSs The model for the observed RFS covers thinning Markov shifts and superposition of false observations A prior for the 
hidden RFS together with the likelihood of the realization of the observed RFS gives the posterior distribution via the application of Bayes rule In practice computing this posterior is intractable in general due the inherently combinatorial nature of the problem and the usual complications associated with the curse of dimensionality A number of approximations have been proposed The probability hypothesis density PHD  and Cardinalized PHD CPHD 6 updates are approximations based on moments and cardinality distributions while the multi-Bernoulli update approximates the posterior distribution by a multi-Bernoulli RFS distribution In this paper we present a closed form solution to the posterior distribution for a class of multi-object prior distributions In particular we introduce the notion of distinctly labeled RFS and propose a new class of prior distribution called generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli RFS or generalized labeled iid cluster 
point process We show that distinctly labeled multi-Bernoulli RFSs and Poisson point processes falls under the umbrella of generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli RFSs More importantly we prove that the proposed generalized multi-Bernoulli point process is a conjugate prior with respect to the multi-target observation likelihood Consequently the posterior distribution can be expressed in closed form This result is applied to develop an analytic implementation of the Bayes multi-target 223lter for linear Gaussian multi-target models II B ACKGROUND In a multiple target system the number of targets varies with time due to the appearance and disappearance of targets and the number of measurements received at each time step does not necessarily match the number of targets due to missed detections and clutter The objective of multiple target tracking is to jointly estimate the number of targets and their

encapsulates all statistical information about the multi-target state given the observed data Despite its rigorous foundations and theoretical elegance the Bayes multiple target 223lter is generally

get Bayes 223lter in its current form does not provide tracks or target trajectories Simply augmenting each target state with an identity or label does not solve the problem since the elements of a multi-target state do not necessarily have distinct labels even though the elements themselves are distinct In the next section we introduce the notion of a labeled RFS to alleviate this problem

derived closed form solution The continuous kinematic component of the target state and hence the individual target tracks are represented as Gaussian mixtures which are predicted and updated using the standard Gaussian sum 223lter equations The discrete label component of the target states are explicitly expanded and represented as a grid or table where each point corresponds to a particular component in the generalized labeled Multi-Bernoulli density The multitarget prediction and update steps are then calculated on component by component basis using Murty\220s algorithm to generate predicted and updated components respectively in order of decreasing weights post prediction and update To ensure tractability of the 223lter the predicted and updated multi-target density must be truncated retaining only the components with the highest weights This is achieved by employing Murty\220s algorithm to calculate newly predicted and updated components in decreasing order of predicted and updated weights and stopping at a determined threshold For each existing component the number of new components calculated and stored in each forward propagation is set to be proportional to the

of targets versus time for MTB and CPHD 223lters VI C ONCLUSION This paper proposes the 223rst random 223nite set conjugate prior corresponding to the multi-target likelihood in the multitarget Bayes 223lter The resultant recursion propagates an exact solution to the multi-target posterior recursively in time The solution is built upon the concept of a labeled random 223nite set and formally incorporates the propagation and estimation of unique track labels within the 223ltering framework A tractable implementation is demonstrated for linear Gaussian multi-target models by use of the Gaussian sum 223lter to propagate individual target tracks and more importantly by application of Murty\220s algorithm to dynamically truncate posterior components thereby ensuring a polynomial time complexity Preliminary results indicate that the proposed MTB 223lter performs remarkably well and signi\223cantly outperforms the CPHD 223lter in both localization and cardinality estimation A

Analysis of experiment Result From Table 3 ,  we can conclude: most of the rules mined by fuzzy association rules algorithm can reflect the relevance between the attributes and faults in the industrial boiler system. The result of experiment shows that the algorithm is of high preciseness for mining rules 67 IV. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY In this paper, competitive agglomeration and fuzzy association rules are applied in fault diagnosis at the same time, the result with the requirements for diagnosis correctness. In the future, considering to add scale center in the situation that has plenty of data, and higher dimensions are also will be researched; in this way can we improve the performance of fault diagnosis REFERENCES I] Ashok Savasere, Edward Omiecinski, and Shamkant Navathe.

This means that the dependency between education and wage is proven One problem remains: the given result is global and we are interested in a local diagnostic to indicate the cells that contribute the most in the 2. To deal with this problem, we use the adjusted standardized residual [4] noted RSA RSA \(Equation 3 tween the adjusted residual of Haberman [2] \(Equation 1 equation 2 Equation 1 restitutes the adjusted residual of Haberman which equals the standardized residual of Pearson divided by standard error RA\(xi, yj nij ninj N ninj N ni/N 1? nj/N 1 V ar\(xi, yj 1 ni N  1 nj N  2 RSA\(xi, yj RA\(xi, yj V ar\(xi, yj 3

In order to notice the differences, all grayed cells are pruned thanks to the RSA education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 3 4 15 -22 4.75; 7.14] 1 3 8 -12 7.30; 12.67] -2 -3 1 5 13.00; 26.29] -1 -4 -25 30 TABLE VII ENHANCED CONTINGENCY TABLE OF VARIATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION \(EDUCATION-WAGE This table is the starting point of the consolidation process described below 39 


V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables
