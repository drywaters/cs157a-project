Data mining research is interrelated to many fields and one of the most important ones is bioinformatics. Among many 
techniques, mining association rules or frequent patterns is one of the most studied techniques in computer science and it is applicable to bioinformatics. Association analysis of gene expressions may be used as decision support mechanism for finding genes that are in same pathway. In this work, publicly available yeast microarray data has been analyzed using an efficient frequent pattern mining algorithm Matrix Apriori and frequently co-over-expressed genes have been identified Keywords\227frequent pattern mining; microarray I   I NTRODUCTION  The process of discovering knowledge or patterns from massive amounts of data is defined as data mini   I n l a st  
decades data mining has become a popular research area in computer science and also it is applied to many problems in other disciplines. With the increasing power of computers, data mining applications became capable of handling huge amount of data and this attracted people in many disciplines as well as bioinformatics. Classification, clustering and association rule or frequent pattern mining are three main types of data mining techniques [2   Association analysis is studied by many computer scientists and applied to many fields. It came into prominence by the help of barcode technology which resulted construction of transactional databases in markets. Later it was thought that it would be beneficial to find frequently purchased items in the 
markets in order to increase sales. In  a s s o c i a t io n rule  mining was introduced as a new data mining technique which could be used for market basket analysis. Association rule mining, searches for items frequently purchased together when the market domain is considered. For instance, through frequent pattern mining, it can be found that sugar and tea are purchased together frequently. Placing these items closer or going on a discount may increase sales. Mining frequent patterns is used in many applications, however, it is not that much applied to bioinformatics Microarray is an effective technique used in molecular biology to analyze gene expression in different conditions such as control versus drug treatment or healthy versus disease 
conditions   in many organisms. Huge amount of data has been generated already and it is difficult to handle such large amount of data for analysis. Mining frequent patterns in gene expression data seems applicable and may help bioinformatics researchers. In the gene expression analysis context, we are looking for which genes are frequently expressed together in different experiment conditions. This will lead us to knowledge of genes that are expressed association in defined conditions hereby this will facilitate the molecular biologists to define components of biological pathways with further  studies In this study we applied a frequent pattern mining algorithm to a DNA microarray gene expression dataset. A 
publicly available dataset of \223saccharomyces cerevisiae\224 [4 is  used. To apply frequent pattern mining, firstly, gene expression data will be transformed into transactional dataset like market basket datasets [5   Ov ere x p r esse d g e n e s w ill b e c o n s i d e r e d as  purchased items and experiment conditions as transactions After transformation, frequent pattern mining algorithm will be applied on this generated transactional dataset. At last, we will gain the knowledge to help us determine the possible interactions between different genes. For our study we used Matrix Apriori algorithm [6 o r m i n i n g f r eq u e n t  p a tte rn s  The organization of the paper is as follows. Next section introduces DNA microarray and how it is obtained. Following that in section 3, frequent pattern mining and Matrix Apriori 
algorithm are explained with examples. In section 4, results of case study is given and at last paper is concluded II  DNA  M ICROARRAY  DNA microarray technology is an advanced technique to study gene expression in different conditions like drug treatment versus control or healthy versus disease conditions DNA microarray technology is based on hybridization of DNA or oligonucleotide probes which represent specific genes with fluorescently or chemiluminescence-labeled DNA or cDNA fragments. Tens of thousands of DNA or oligonucleotide probes covalently bound to glass, silicone chips or microscopic beads to form DNA micro arrays in a precise and known 
pattern and representing thousands of genes in the genome [7  Microarray technique is simply depicted in Fig. 1. mRNA is isolated from organism of interest  in control and test conditions than mRNA is converted to cDNA with reverse transcription reaction than, cDNA samples from control and test conditions labeled with different florescent tags. The two pools of labeled cDNA are mixed and hybridized to the DNA microarray containing a full set of tens of thousands of DNA sequences based on genomic or complimentary DNA \(cDNA 


sequences after hybridization, the chip is washed.  Finally, the microarray array is scanned using a specialized fluorimager and the color and intensity of each spot is determined According to the colors and intensities of each spot expression levels of genes can be calculated by contrasting control versus treatment arrays [8 A s a res u lt of  a m i cr oa r r ay ex pe rim e n t   datasets containing long lists of measurements of spot intensities and intensity ratios which are generated either by pair wise comparison of two samples or by comparing several samples to a common control are generated. Differentially expressed genes or co-regulated genes with related function can be identified by analyzing the generated dataset with some complicated softwares [9   A.

It is the most important and time consuming part of association rule mining. Researchers are focused on efficiently finding frequent itemsets such that frequent pattern mining and frequent itemset mining began to be used as synonym of association rule mining. Association rule mining was firstly introduced in [3 a n d it is  o n e  o f th e m o st im p o rt an t  and well defined techniques of data mining. Aim of association rule mining is to extract interesting correlations, frequent patterns, associations or casual structures among sets of items in the transactional databases or other data repositories [1   If  you consider market basket data, the purchasing of one product\(X\ while another product\(Y\ is purchased represents an association rule [1 an d is dis p l a y e d as X Y. Association rule mining process consists of two steps: finding frequent itemsets and generating association rules. The rules are generated from frequent itemsets. An itemset is a set of items in the database. A frequent itemset is one of which support value \(percentage of transactions in the database that contain both X and Y\ is above the threshold defined as minimum support. The main concentration of most association rule mining algorithms is to find frequent item-sets in an efficient way to reduce the overall cost of the process A  Matrix Apriori Algorithm After introduction of association rules, Apriori algorithm proposed in [12 d i t  h a p p en ed t o b e on e of  t h e m o s t po pu l a r  frequent pattern mining algorithms. In spite of its popularity it has a bottleneck of multiple database scans for generation and testing of candidate patterns. FP-Growth algorithm [13 is  alternative to Apriori since it finds frequent patterns without candidate generation. Another efficient algorithm without candidate generation is Matrix Apriori algorithm [6  I t w a s  shown to perform better than FP-Growth in  I t us es a compact data structure representing the original database. Data structure build for Matrix Apriori is a matrix representing frequent items \(MFI\nd a vector holding support of candidates \(STE\ The search for frequent patterns is executed on these two structures, which is faster than accessing to the original databa   In Fig. 2, first phase of Matrix Apriori algorithm is demonstrated. For the example transactional dataset, support value is 2 \(%50\. Firstly, a database scan to determine frequent items is executed and a frequent items list is obtained. The list is in descending order DATABASE TID ITEMS 001 002 003 004 A C D B C E A B C E B E FREQUENT ITEMS COUNT B C E A D 3 3 3 2 1  Figure 2 First scan of Matrix Apriori algorithm Following this, a second scan on database is executed During the scan, MFI and STE are constructed as follows. Each transaction is read. If the transaction has any item that is in the frequent item list then it is represented as \2231\224 and other-wise 2230\224. This pattern is added as a row to MFI matrix and its occurrence is set to 1 in STE vector. While reading remaining transactions if the transaction is already included in MFI then in STE its occurrence is incremented. Otherwise it is added to MFI and its occurrence in STE is set to 1. After reading all transactions the MFI matrix is modified to speed up frequent pattern search. For each column of MFI, beginning from the first row, the value of a cell is set to the row number in which the item is \2231\224. If there is not any \2231\224 in remaining rows then the value of the cell is set to \2231\224 which means down to the bottom of the matrix, no row contains this item \(see Fig. 3

Beginning from the least frequent item, create candidate itemsets and count their support value. The support value of an itemset is the sum of the items at STE of which index are rows where all the items of the candidate itemset are included in MFI\222s related row. Frequent itemsets found can be seen in Fig. 4 FREQUENT ITEMSETS SUPPORT C,A 2 C,E 2 B,E 3 B,C 2 B,C,E 2  Figure 4 Frequent itemsets/patterns found IV  C ASE S TUDY  In case study, publicly available yeast microarray dataset from [4 i s a n a l y z ed  T h er e a re 173  e xpe r i m e nt a l  co nd i t i o ns and 6152 genes. Frequently over-expressed genes are found for given minimum support values. Firstly, dataset is transformed into appropriate format that developed Matrix Apriori mining software can process. The over-expressed genes are considered like items purchased in market basket data\in order to obtain transactional dataset. In Fig. 5, the structure of a simple dataset file can be seen. For each gene a number is assigned \(6152 for our dataset\nd between \223BEGIN_DATA\224 and 223END_DATA\224 microarray data is given. Each row represents the genes over-expressed in that experiment condition \(173 for our dataset 1 Gene1 2 Gene2 3 Gene3 4 Gene4 5 Gene5 BEGIN_DATA 1 3 4 2 3 5 1 2 3 5 2 5 END_DATA  Figure 5 File structure for developed program After transformation, frequent pattern mining is performed Results are obtained for four minimum support values. Table 1 below displays the runtime \(milliseconds\, number of frequent patterns found for given minimum support TABLE I  R ESULTS FOR DIFFERENT MINIMUM SUPPORT VALUES  MINIMUM SUPPORT  NUMBER OF FREQUENT PATTERNS TIME TO FIND FREQUENT PATTERNS \(ms 90 0 226 80 9 302 70 8343 10147 60 150507538 33317405  Results of frequent pattern mining will be useless if there is unmanageable number of patterns found. For 70% and 60 minimum support values, this situation occurs. The number of frequent patterns found is very high. It will be difficult to use these results for decision support. Time costs also reveal the difficulty of pattern mining in microarray data.  Therefore results of 80% minimum support are given below in Table 2 First column displays UIDs of frequently over-expressed genes. Second column displays support count and support percentage of frequent gene patterns. Third column gives functions of the genes \(explanations are obtained from dataset file and give biological process, function/protein name\he patterns found What can be inferred from patterns below is that the possibility of some genes being in same pathway is high. These genes are related and they will function at similar processes or over-expression of one affects one another

In [15 p ri or i  algorithm is used for analysis of gene expression data However, Matrix Apriori algorithm is shown to be faster than the popular Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms. Therefore, we used Matrix Apriori algorithm for data mining. Firstly, data is transformed into appropriate format and frequent pattern analysis is applied. Most frequent genes are defined in the case study. The applied approach for microarray data analysis will be helpful to molecular biologist for analyzing the microarray data and identify the candidate genes acting in same or related biological pathways. In this study, only over-expressed genes are analyzed and it would be nice future work to analyze association of under-expressed genes and also both under and over-expressed genes together. As a result of our study, we obtained some information in agreement with published results As is known in literature, in increased stress conditions oxidative stress defense mechanisms are activated as a result of increased oxidative stress [16 In ou r res u l t s  th r e e  ox i d a t i v e stress defense related genes are detected to be over-expressed in association with several genes. The obtained information seems more interesting when we consider this microarray data was obtained in stress treatment conditions R EFERENCES  1  L. Liu, M. \326zsu, Encyclopedia of Database Systems.

as traits in our context  4. Method  We propose a new analytical framework to identify the relations between multiple SNPs and traits. The proposed method consists of two phases. In Phase 1 dimensions of SNP genotype data are reduced by means of the TF-IDF weighting method. Once reduced multiple SNP-trait associations are located from the data in the second phase through class association rule mining  4.1. Dataset  We used the HGDP panel data in the study, which are provided by the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH The data contain a pool of SNP genotypes of 1,043 individuals selected from 57 population groups. SNPs of an individual amount to more than 660,000 in number. To eliminate the impact of the gender factor SNPs on sex chromosomes were eliminated1 The 57 population groups were broadly divided into Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East, America and Oceania  4.2. Phase 1: Dimensionality Reduction  The SNP genotype data are of high dimension in nature, which makes it particularly challenging to apply conventional analysis methods. In order to alleviate the problem, we first reduce the dimension of the data using TF-IDF weighting, after transforming the data according to the document-term model, as explained above. Under the model, each population group is deemed a document, and each SNP genotype as the term constituting the document. Then, the TFIDF weight of each SNP genotype is calculated as follows  b b   \b         \(6 


 where TFij is the normalized term frequency of SNP j in population i, and IDFj is the log-ratio of the total number of populations and the number of populations that have SNP j In accordance with the calculated TF-IDF weights top-k high-scoring SNPs are selected from each population. Only the SNPs appearing at least once in the top-k lists are used for class association rule mining in Phase 2  4.3. Phase 2: Rule Mining  In the second phase, we analyze the reduceddimension SNP genotype data through the transaction analysis model. If a SNP genotype retained by an individual is considered as an item, it is possible to deem each individual a single transaction. Within this context, SNP genotype data are transformed into a set of transactions. Further, each transaction is labeled with a trait, which is in our context, a population group Once transformed, the conventional class association rule mining becomes applicable. The class association rule is expressed, as follows  f 7  where representing a set of SNP genotypes and Populationj represents  1 http://www.cephb.fr/en/hgdp 320 the jth population. This rule implies that the SNPSet is likely to be associated with the jth population In conventional class association rule mining, the support is defined over all classes. In our context however, it may penalize the small-sized populations as they are likely to be ruled out because of the inevitable low frequency co-occurrence of the SNP sets and the population. In order to address this problem 


we introduce a normalized support that is a support normalized by the size of population. On the other hand, for confidence, the conventional definition can be used as is. The rule confidence and population support are given as follows    01"+23456278+,-./+.018      \(8 9 01"+234561278+,-3234561278     \(9  Rule confidence represents how strong the association between a SNP set and a population would be. In other words, a rule is given a high confidence when the SNP set appears frequently in the population group, and not in the other population groups. On the other hand, Population support refers to the frequency of a SNP set existing in a population group. By appropriately setting these two parameters, we are able to obtain rules that highlight population specific SNP associations  5. Results & Discussion  To attest to the validity of the proposed method, we conducted three tests. First, we conducted a clustering analysis using the reduced-dimension SNP genotype data in order to see the efficacy of the TF-IDF weighting as a dimensionality reduction tool. Second we carried out rule mining to discover rules associating SNP sets to populations. To prove the validity of the rules obtained from the experiment, we performed literature survey. Unfortunately, no studies have been conducted on the SNPs that we extracted in the rules let alone the relations between them and the population Finally, we iterated the same test, this time to discover rules associating SNP sets to the geographical regions instead of populations. The validity of some of the rules obtained in this experiment was proven through previous studies on the SNPs that are related to the Asian population [12 For the dimensionality reduction test, each of the 57 


population groups in the dataset was considered as a single document, and a SNP IDgenotype pair with minor allele was considered as a term. After weighting the terms using TF-IDF, we extracted top-100 terms from each population group. Using these terms, the Jaccard similarity between each population group was computed Figure 1 represents the dendrogram of the populations that was constructed using the Jaccard similarity as the similarity metric. The result shown in Figure 1 suggests that the TF-IDF-based weighting could be a viable alternative for the dimensionality reduction for the SNP genotype data. The reason is that population groups sharing the same branch are those who live close to each other or those who live in the same country. It is reasonable to assume that ethnic groups living in similar geographical regions and sharing similar cultures must come from the same origin It was difficult, however, to interpret the results concerning the Bantu group, since most of the populations in Bantu group had only one or two samples in the dataset. Still, it seems plausible to Figure 1.  A dendrogram constructed with top100 SNP genotype data using Jaccard similarity 321 analogically infer that the emerging pattern of SNPs minor allele of each individual using the Bantu language is similar to each other. One intriguing matter is that the Chinese minority group of Uygur population shares branches with other Muslim population groups In other words, Uygur population shows a high similarity with Muslim group. Indeed, they turned out the decedents of Osman Turks2  Rules Population [F-score rs98278[mm] Bantu_N.E.

Rules extracted from the second experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and populations are identified. The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  Previous studies on genetic structures of ethnic groups reached a similar conclusion. Rosenberg et al conducted clustering analysis using SNP data clustering 52 peoples into 6 clusters [11]. Each cluster belongs to one of the following: Africa Europe+Middle East+Central/South Asia, East Asia Oceania, America and Kalash population. Under this scheme, Europe, Middle East and Asia populations constitute one cluster. A similar result was observed also in our study. For example, in the left part of the 


dendrogram, Asian and European populations are shown to share the same branch. In the middle part American populations share a branch. And in the right  2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people part, Africa populations share one branch and Central/South Asia populations share another Next, the class association rule mining was tested The resulting frequent SNP groups of subject populations further revealed the frequent SNP sets unique to some population groups. Some of the results are shown in Table 1. Table 1 depicts top scoring rules up to three returned less than three rules that exceed our quality constraints. We used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and Population Support. In the end, 3,779 rules were drawn out. Under each rule, M indicates the major allele of the relevant SNP locus, while m refers to the minor allele of the locus. Most of the rules are 3-SNP rules with the 5-SNP rule being the longest. Each rules weight is computed through the following ;  9  9 A?BCDCEFG=@@EAHAIHCE<=>?@A?BCDCEFJG=@@EAHAIHCE    \(11  A SNP constituting a rule with high scores usually shows a high frequency of its minor allele in the corresponding population. For instance, with regard to genotypes rs1553533 and rs1553554, one of the two genotypes is found overwhelmingly more often than the other in Surui population. Other than this information, however, no studies have been conducted on the relations between populations and the SNPs extracted in the rules In order to work around this problem, we examined the association between SNPs and traits in a coarser level. In this experiment, we examined the association between the SNPs and the geographical regions. In our dataset, multiple populations are mapped to a geographical region. The results are shown in Table 2 We also used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and Population Support for this experiment. The rules 


found in this experiment retain F-scores lower than those in Table 1 This outcome seems to stem from the increased heterogeneity of the individuals in the same class \(i.e., geographical region KLMNOPQRSTTU  V9 suggests that rs256871 SNP has some relation with Asian populations. Our literature survey discovered an association between them such that rs256871 SNP is part of SEPT8 gene, and, in turn the SEPT8 gene is known to be accountable for tuberculosis among Asians [12 Nonetheless, most of the rules found in this study were difficult to interpret, because, out of more than 660,000 SNPs used in the study, very small numbers of such SNPs had been subject to research for  3 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218008T 4 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218014Q 322 determining the relations with particular traits such as population and geographical region.

Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
