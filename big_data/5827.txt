It can improve operational efficiencies, help predict and plan responses to disease epidemics, improve the quality of monitoring of clinical trials, and optimize healthcare spending at all levels from patients to hospital systems to governments This paper provides an overview of Big Data, applicability of it in healthcare, some of the work in progress and a future outlook on how Big Data analytics can improve overall quality in healthcare systems Keywords- Big Data, Healthcare I  I NTRODUCTION TO BIGDATA  Big Data refers to large, complex datasets that are beyond the capabilities of traditional data management systems to store, manage, and process in a timely and economical manner. Often in petabytes, structured, semistructured, and unstructured, Big Data creates challenges in data capture, transfer, encryption, storage, analysis, and visualization [1  B i g Da ta is a d i sru p tiv e p h en o m en o n st ill  in the early stages of adoption for many sectors, but it is very clear that harnessing its capabilities can provide compelling benefits Web 2.0 companies were most successful in monetizing Big Data Many Big Data related innovations were also developed by them, contributing to the industry a growing collection of open source technologies that have dramatically changed the culture of collaborative software development and the scale and economics of hardware infrastructure   Industry analyst reports show that Big Data and analytics can generate significant financial values in many vertical markets, including healthcare, finance, retail, environmental research, genomics, and biological and life science research Big Data market is estimated to grow 45% annually and expected to be over $25 billion by 2014 [3  e Fi gu r e 1 Considering the fact that healthcare spending is one of the biggest financial challenges of the U.S., optimizing it while improving the quality of care is extremely important for patients to health care providers to government agencies Long term fiscal challenges for federal and state governments include the growing costs of Medicare Medicaid, and other public health programs, which are often hampered by lack of access and timeliness of the data that reside across various computer systems silos [5 A c c o rd ing the Harvard School of Public Health publication entitled The Promise of Big Data petabytes of raw information could provide clues for everything from preventing tuberculosis to shrinking health care costsóif we can figure out how to apply this data [6  Im prov in g  th e ca re of  ch ron i c dis e as es   uncovering the clinical effectiveness of treatments, and reducing readmissions are expected to be top priority use cases for Big Data in healthcare [7        Figure 1. Big Data Growth  II  HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW  The healthcare industry is one of the most critical industries. It is also one of the world's largest and fastestgrowing industries [7   The U.S. healthcare industry is evolving through significant challenges in recent times. Some of the key challenges include, but are not limited to: escalating costs of care delivery, raising patient volumes with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, an aging population with a high incidence of chronic disease, substantial shortage of medical professionals, and penalties for readmissions and significant reductions in reimbursement In most countries, healthcare costs account for a good percentage of its economy. For example, the cost of healthcare spending in 2012 in the U.S. was estimated at 2.6 trillion, approximately 17.6% of gross domestic product GDP\ [9  S e e  Fig u r e 2  In th e f u tu r e   th e cos t of  h e al th ca r e  is projected to continuously increase. For example, estimates 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 17 


put U.S. healthcare costs at $4.1 trillion in 2016. Individual segments within healthcare industry also follow the same trend. A report by IMS Research estimates that spending for pharmacy drugs will increase to $1.2 trillion by 2016 [9    Figure 2. Healthcare spending by geography  While the healthcare industry is very critical and vast, it is unfortunately highly inefficient. According to a report from the Institute of Medicine, one third of the spending in healthcare \(approximately $750 billion\ today is wasted and not contributing to improving healthcare outcomes. A further breakdown analysis of the waste in healthcare in the same report from the Institute of Medicine indicates many areas such unnecessary services, administrative waste including unproductive and duplicate documentation, inefficiently delivered services, high prices, fraud and missed prevention opportunities [1  Figure 3. Waste in Healthcare spent  To understand the sources of inefficiencies in healthcare it is extremely important to understand how data, processes people, and devices enable care coordination. Lack of coordination and standards result in higher cost and poor outcome. It is estimated that in one out of five elderly patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge for no known reason. See Figure 4  Figure 4. Example of inefficiencies in healthcare Insurance companies and governments reimburse for procedures performed rather than outcomes achieved Patients bear little responsibility for the cost of the health care services they demand Reforming healthcare to improve the quality and care is essential to address efficiencies in the system, increasing costs, poor quality, and increasing numbers of people without health insurance coverage. Major healthcare reforms are being debated in the U.S. and around the world. The focuses of healthcare reforms include   Improving quality, safety, efficiency, and reducing health disparities   Engaging patients and family   Improving care coordination and public health   Maintaining the privacy and security of patient health information   Enhancing clinical outcomes   Improving population health outcomes   Increasing transparency and efficiency   Empowering individuals   Generating more robust research data on health systems As the healthcare industry focuses on improvements, Big Data Analytics can play a significant role in addressing the challenges of mining the relevant information at the point of care to enable safer, faster, more cost effective, and more efficient medical practices III  BIGDATA IN HEALTHCARE  The Big Data revolution has begun for many industries The healthcare industry has been playing catch up and has finally reached a consensus on the value of Big Data as a transformative tool. According to McKinsey & Company study entitled The Big Data Revolution in Healthcare bigdata revolution is under way in health care enable by increased availability of information. Major data sources include years of research and development data form pharmaceutical companies, Electronic Medical Records EMRs\ and Electronic Health Records \(EHRs\ from healthcare providers, and clinical trials data covered under public insurance programs from US government agencies Recent technology advancements in hardware and software are making it easier to collect, transfer, storage, aggregate and analysis data from multiple sources [24  Ye t th er e a r e  privacy and standardization challenges that need to be addressed before we full adaption Overall, McKinsey & Company estimates that $300 billion to $450 billion can be saved in the healthcare industry from Big Data Analytics [12    18 


While healthcare industry is slowly realizing the value from Big Data, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California and AstraZeneca are few exceptions who have already implemented integrated analytics systems to improve efficiency [2    Kaiser Permanenteís HealthConnect system connecting all their facilities have improved outcomes in cardiovascular disease and achieved an estimated $1 billion in savings from reduced office visits and lab tests. Blue Shield of California in partnership with NantHealth, has developed an integrated  technology system to improve health-care delivery AstraZeneca in partnership with HealthCore, a subsidiary of WellPoint, is conducting real-world studies to determine the most effective and economical treatments for some chronic illnesses and common diseases [24   Some argue that the key to making Big Data a greater reality in healthcare is by integrating healthcare provider systems with insurance agencies and government agencies. If consensus cab be reached on privacy, legal, security and compliance issues  the combination of the three agencies can optimize resources and analyze their shared information to spot trends, speed up recoveries, and perform both evidence based medicine and preventive medicine  As new care models such as Accountable Care Organizations ACO\ emerge, the focus is on driving the wellness of and identifying the at risk population well in advance.  Offering appropriate programs such as patient engagement and adherence is critical to the success of ACOs. Big Data patterns, trends, demographics, and claims can be used to predict future patterns. In a recent Healthcare Business News article entitled Why one Medicare Pioneer ACO Succeeded in Saving Money the use of analytics powered by Big Data was clearly called out as a key initiative contributing to success. They are able to identify the risk for hospitalization using sophisticated algorithm   Big Data analytics enables the capture of insights from data gathered from research, clinical care settings, and operational settings to build evidence for improved care delivery. Today, as indicated in the Institute of Medicine IOM\ report, these are critical gaps. There is a significant opportunity to improve the efficiencies in the healthcare industry by using an evidence-based learning model, which can in turn be powered by Big Data analytics [9 s th e  focus shifts from cure to preventive health and as new technologies such as wearable sensors evolve as part of the Internet of Things \(IoT\ the volume of data in healthcare is expected to grow significantly and can provide a wealth of actionable information. The combined power of information from real-time devices, people, clinical systems, and historical population data makes Big Data a very helpful tool in improving the healthcare system  IV  EXAMPLES  BIG DATA INITIATIVES IN HEALTHCARE   There are several initiatives utilizing the potential of Big Data in healthcare. Some of the examples are listed below Asthmapolis The company has created a global positioning system \(GPS enabled tracker that monitors inhaler usage by patients, eventually leading to more effective treatment of asthma. By placing a small cap like device containing a GPS sensor on top of an inhaler, the company is able to gather usage information. When a patient is suffering from an asthma attack and is required to use his or her inhaler, the little device records the time and place that the inhaler was used and transmits this information to a web site. This data is then combined with information available through the Center for Disease Control \(CDC\ The CDCíS information includes facts such as what are the most prominent asthma catalysts present in the air for that location and where the highest pollen count is located. The end product is the ability to show asthmatics how other people with similar reactions to specific allergens reacted and if taking an inhaler was necessary. A patient can become more aware when making decisions to travel and be more aware if they should prepare for a potential asthma attack. The combination of this large amount of data can also allow a physician to create a personalized plan for the patient targeting specific times of the day when the risk of an asthma attack is higher and responding by either increasing or decreasing the dosage [14  Battling the Flu Big Data analytics has become a weapon for CDC to combat influenza, which claims millions of lives a year. Every week, the CDC receives over 700,000 flu reports. These reports include the details on the sickness what treatment was given, and whether not the treatment was successful. The CDC has made this information available to the general public called FluView an application that organizes and sifts through this extremely large amount of data to create a clearer picture for doctors of how the disease is spreading across the nation in near real-time.  Along with providing the precise locations of patients combating the flu the application provides caregivers with information such as what vaccines combat which strain of the flu and which antiviral medications can aid the patient in their recovery   The applications of Big Data for combating the flu donít stop at what a doctor can do for a patient; there is increasing development of applications that are meant to assist patients in their own recovery from the flu. An application called FluNearYou created by the Skoll Global Threats Fund and the American Public Health Association, asks users to input their symptoms in the application before they actually fall ill with the sickness. Thus, by gathering data when people start falling sick, a map of flu activity is generated and could allow users to prepare themselves and prevent exposure to the bug. Another tool Germ Tracker is similar to FluNearYou but instead pulls data exclusively from social media. The benefit of this is that analysts have access to the data from thousands of cases that have gone unreported to doctors. A disadvantage is that in some cases a person posting on social media may be incorrect about their selfdiagnosis. Another application is Help, I Have the Flu  designed by the pharmaceutical company Help Remedies This application also takes advantage of social media and searches for the person responsible for passing the flu to 19 


individuals by scanning through updates for key words such as ìfluî and ìcoughî [15 GNS Healthcare and Aetna GNS Healthcare, a Big Data analytics company, has come together with the health insurance company Aetna to help combat people at risk or already with metabolic syndromes. GNS has developed a technology known as Reverse Engineering and Forward Simulation \(REFS\ that will be put to work on the data of Aetna insurance subscribers. Essentially, the technology will search for the presence of five warning signs: large waist size, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low Highdensity Lipoprotein \(HDL\nd high blood sugar. A combination of any three of these lead to the conclusion that the patient is suffering from the condition. Two or less suggest that the patient may be at high risk of suffering from the condition. Different combinations of these warning signs lead to different conclusions. For example, low HDL and high triglycerides is a sign of high-risk hypertension within the next 12 months while high blood sugar and high triglycerides could lead to a completely different conclusion   Diabetes and Big Data Diabetes patients can also benefit from the Big Data revolution in health care. A company named Common Sensing has produced GoCap, a cap for prefilled insulin pens that can not only record the amount of insulin administered daily but also the specific times the dosages were administered. This information is then transmitted to either a mobile phone where an application records this data or to a connected glucometer This data is then easily available to healthcare professionals and allows them to identify problems before they become severe and to tweak dosages if required  Another technology available at the intersection of Big Data and diabetes is a service offered by Allazo Health Their system AllazoEngin is designed to improve on medication adherence programs by using predictive analytics. For example, predict what interventions are mostly likely to work for that patient based on what interventions already worked for other patients with similar demographics behavioral profiles, and medical history [1 23andMe A privately held personal genomics and biotechnology company, provides rapid genetic testing. The company is named for the 23 pairs of chromosomes in a normal human cell. Their personal genome test kit was named "Invention of the Year" by Time magazine in 2008  M i ni ng D N A d a t a f r o m t h o u sa nd s o f  o t her s  a nd comparing it with their own genomic data will help understand genetic health risks and inherited conditions USC Medical Monitor Computer scientists at the University of Southern California \(USC\are teaming up with neurologists, kinesiologists and public health experts to fight against Parkinsonís disease. The team uses various devices to track the movement of the patient and gather large amounts of data including data from 3D sensors of Microsoft Kinect, patientís smartphone, and additional body sensors Then the data is fed into an algorithm that analyzes the data to identify any significant changes in movement. Cesar Blanco, the head of the project, stated, ìOur system will allow patients and their caregivers to monitor disease progression and the effectiveness of treatments in real-time For example, if the system identifies a decreased range of motion or a decreased flexibility, an alert is sent to both patient and caregiver. From there, the application will advise the patient what exercises to do that will strengthen their body and the caregiver can prescribe different medications or change the dosage of a medication. The team hopes to extend this technology beyond Parkinsonís Disease in the future   MD Andersonís Moon Shots Program to Fight Cancer  Just as President John F. Kennedy in 1962 presented the challenge of putting a man on the moon before the end of 1960s, MD Anderson president Ronald DePinho, M.D., has challenged scientists and clinicians to rapidly and significantly reduce mortality in several major cancers [20   The Moon Shots Program aims to improve survival for several types of cancers. It is initially targeting eight cancers selected based on rigorous criteria: the current state of scientific knowledge across the continuum from cancer prevention to survivorship; the strength and breadth of the assembled teams; and the potential for measurable success in reducing deaths. The selected cancers are: Triple-negative breast and ovarian, \(which are linked at the molecular level Leukemia \(AML/MDS\ Leukemia \(CLL\, lung, melanoma and prostate The Moon Shots Program is enabled by several cross platform collaboration efforts between various industries and cancer researchers. Big Data and Massive Data Analytics are a major part of this program. A Big Data platform enables centralization, integration, and secure access of patient and research data and analytical results. A Massive Data Analytics infrastructure enables complex analytics and clinical decision support systems using integrated patient information, including clinical and research data. In addition an Adaptive Learning in Genomic Medicine framework for bringing clinical medicine and genomic research together enables rapid learning to improve patient management using Clinical Genomics, Omics-Bioinformatics, and Massive Data Analytics platforms within the Big Data environment [20   White House Big Data Research and Development Initiative Announced by the Obama Administration in 2012 this initiative aims to make the most of the fast-growing volume of digital data by investing in advanced technologies needed to collect, store, preserve, manage, analyze, and share huge quantities of data and harness these technologies to accelerate the pace of discovery in science and engineering national security, and to transform teaching and learning This initiative include a joint solicitation supported by the National Science Foundation \(NSF\ and the National Institutes of Health \(NIH\ advance the core scientific and technological means of managing, analyzing, visualizing and extracting useful information from large and diverse data sets particularly in  imaging, molecular, cellular electrophysiological, chemical, behavioral, epidemiological clinical, and other data related to health and disease In addition, the NIH Big Data to Knowledge \(BD2K Initiative is designed to help biomedical scientists fully utilize Big Data being generated by research communities BD2K Centers of Excellence will address these issues by 20 


developing new approaches, methods, software, tools, and related resources and by providing training to advance Big Data science in the context of biomedical research. BD2K Centers are expected to be large-scale efforts that take on challenges that are not feasible to address with the standard NIH Research Project Grant \(R01\gram. The Centers will form a BD2K Center Consortium in which each is required to interact and collaborate with other centers in the consortium. They are also encouraged to interact and collaborate with other domestic or international efforts in Big Data science. The BD2K Centers will work in areas spanning Big Data science, producing tools and resources from early-stage to mature development for the biomedical research community. The NIH would like the overall BD2K Center program to covers four areas: Collaborative environments and technologies, data integration, analysis and modeling methodologies and computer science and statistical approaches  V  I NFRASTRUCTURE FOR BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE   CISCO SOLUTION  As a worldwide leader in networking, Cisco is well positioned to help improve the future of healthcare through networked technologies that transform how people connect access and share information, and collaborate. Cisco technologies can benefit all stakeholders, from patients to medical providers, payers, and life sciences organizations Cisco Connected Health solutions enable care team collaboration and business efficiency while promoting a higher quality of care Cisco helps simplify healthcare communications using a network of interoperable technologies that better connect patients with medical providers, payers, and life science organizations. Cisco solutions link critical information people, and knowledge to help improve the healthcare experience. Our vision is a Connected Health ecosystem that helps to shape a world of health without boundaries The Cisco Architecture for Connected Health was developed specifically for healthcare providers to help them build a robust, highly secure, and scalable infrastructure for the delivery of healthcare service by utilizing the guidelines and best practices from Cisco's health care experience which is focused on the hospital data center, unified workspace, and interoperability for healthcare. See Figure 5    Figure 6. Ciscoís Architecture for Connected Health  Cisco also builds an innovative family of unified computing products. This enables the company to provide a complete infrastructure solution including compute, storage connectivity and unified management for Big Data applications that reduce complexity, improves agility, and radically improves cost of ownership. Ciscoís Big Data solution can meet standards like the Payment Card Industry PCI\ Data Security Standard \(DSS\, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \(HIPAA\ important for the healthcare industry Core to Ciscoís Big Data architecture is the Cisco Unified Computing Systemô \(Cisco UCSÆ\ommon Platform Architecture \(CPA\r Big Data [2 a c o m p le t e  infrastructure solution including compute, storage networking, and unified management designed to meet a broad range of applications demands With recently announced support for Intel Distribution for Apache Hadoop [23 h e a r c h i t e c t ure e n ab le s ad va nce d  access control, and encryption of data-in-transit and data-atrest, critical for Big Data deployments in healthcare  VI  FUTURE OUTLOOK   Today the healthcare industry is just beginning to understand all the innovative things that can be done with Big Data. The intersection of data from multiple sources tools, and technologies will promote informative extrapolations of Big Data, allowing the information to generate new and innovative solutions to healthcare The healthcare system today is on a trajectory that is unsustainable. The bulk of costs in the current system are due to patients having chronic care diseases. Thus a focus in the future should be on preventive care as well as population health management and overall wellness. With Big Data health management of a population can be understood better Personalized medicine is a being promoted as the future of the healthcare industry. Today, medicines are made for the masses not for the individual. Going forward, with the help of Big Data, more personalized medicines that uses patientspecific data such as genomics and proteomics can be created based on the profiling of similar patients and their responses to such approaches With the increased adoption of social media and mobility patients today are becoming more and more knowledgeable about the options available to them. This is made possible by tools and technologies that allow them to access the data and reports but in the backend powered by Big Data platforms that intern do massive searches, aggregations, and pattern recognitions. New data sources and analytics technologies are expected to emerge in the near future that will change the way  we  practice medicine  Greater collaboration across industries and between the public and private sectors can improve efficiencies in healthcare system. By integrating data from various sources can build predictive models that can lower overall cost and improve quality of care significantly, and accelerate the shift to evidence-based and preventive-based medicine. With 21 


better analytics, the risks will at least be known and the decisions can more informed and quicker to make   VII  ACKNOWLEDGE   The authors thank Dr. Anakha Nambiar for her comments and feedback  R EFERENCES   1  Big Data, Wikipedia: www.wikipedia.org 2  Raghunath Nambiar: Data Management ñ A Look Back and a Look Ahead, WBDB 2012 3  IDC, Digital Universe in 2020 4  Nasscom-CRISIL GR&A Analysis, Reuters 5  Eric Dishman, How Big Data can revolutionize health care:, Politico 6  The Promise of Big Data, Harward School of Public Health, 2012 7  Allen Bernard: Healthcare Industry Sees Big Data As More Than a Bandage 8  Industry Classification Benchmark https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Classification_Benchmark 2013 9  The Global Use of Medicines: Outlook Through 2016,IMS Institute 2012   Peter Groves, Basel Kayyali, David Knott, Steve Van Kuiken: The Big Dataí Revolution in Healthcare: Center of US Health System Reform Business Technology Office, 2013   Devon M Herrick, Linda Gorman, John C.

parallelism is dominated by the max part resulting from decomposition One of the typical graph decomposition methods is to compute connected components [7, 20 To ev alu ate ou r decomposition method, we compare the maximum augmented partition with the maximum connected component in the bipartite graph constructed by using web browsing logs from 2013/01/15 00:00AM to 2013/01/15 1:00AM. The result is shown in Figure 11, where the maximum augmented partition is smaller than one-tenth of the maximum connected components. It proves that our decomposition method is more effective and can lead to better parallelism Figure 11: size of the max part after decomposing 3.4 million of input vertices We compare the performance of our proposed algorithm GMR\ith the standard MapR educe algorithm \(SMR\MR consists of two MapRed uce jobs: Enumeration and Deduplication. The Enumeration job is to enumerate all quasibicliques, and the Deduplication job is to eliminate duplicate quasi-bicliques from the output of the Enumeration job. The details are described in Algorithm 5 and 6 Enumeration Map\(keyIn, valueIn  keyIn: a vertex in part valueIn: neighbors of  for in valueIn keyOut valueOut := \(keyIn, valueIn output \(keyOut, valueOut Reduce\(keyIn, valueIn empty set empty set empty map for neighobrs\ valueIn add to for in neighbors if is in keys      else    for cnt  if cnt   add to keyOut := keyIn vaueOut   output \(keyOut valueOut Deduplication Map\(keyIn, valueIn  keyIn: a vertex in part valueIn: the quasi-biclique for  keyOut := MD5 checksum of valueIn valueOut := valueIn output \(keyOut, valueOut Reduce\(keyIn, valueIn output valueIn The bipartite domain-IP graph is constructed by using web browsing logs from 2013/01/15 00:00AM to 2013/01/15 1:00AM.

I C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTRUE W ORK Quasi-biclique mining plays an important role in providing security services. In this work, we propose a fast algorithm for quasi-biclique mining in web-scale graphs. The main idea is to partition the graph into communities by using an iterative Giraph program so that each community is smaller enough to be processed by a single reducer in parallel. We also prove the convergence of our partitioning algorithm Our ongoing research includes extending the partitioning algorithm for more general bipartite graphs. Our partitioning algorithm is based on the assumption that the input graph is composed of biclique-like communities. The assumption is generally true for domain-IP graphs but may fail to hold for other kinds of graphs like website-client graphs, machine-file graphs and customer-product graphs.

partitions This partitioning function should yield equally-sized partitions and preserve at the same time data locality   points that are close in the spatial domain should be assigned to the same partition In order to satisfy these constraints the partitioning function has to map multidimensional datapoints into an ordered sequence of unidimensional values In practice this transformation is performed with the help of that precisely map multidimensional data to one dimension while preserving data locality In our R-Tree construction we implemented and tested two types of space-ìlling curves the curve and the curve The MapReduce design for this phase consists of several mappers and one reducer Each mapper Algorithm 6 Appendix samples a predeìned number of objects from its data chunk and outputs the corresponding single-dimensional values obtained after applying the space-ìlling curve Afterwards the reducer Algorithm 7 Appendix collects a set of single dimensional values from all mappers orders this set and then determines partitioning points in the sequence partitioning points delimit the boundaries of each partition The second phase concurrently builds individual R-Trees by indexing the partitions outputted by the rst phase The mappers Algorithm 8 Appendix split the dataset into partitions using the space-ìlling curve computed during the rst phase Each mapper processes its chunk and assigns each object it reads to a partition identiìer The intermediate key is represented by the partition identiìer such that all datapoints sharing the same key   belonging to the same partition will be collected by the same reducer Then each reducer Algorithm 9 Appendix constructs the R-Tree associated with its partition leading to a total of reducers building small R-Trees Finally the last phase merges the small R-Trees into a global one indexing all datapoints of the initial dataset VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed to adopt the MapReduce paradigm in order to be able to perform a privacy analysis on large scale geolocated datasets composed of millions of mobility traces More precisely we have developed a complete MapReduce-based approach to GEPETO for GEoPrivacyEnhancing TOolkit a softw are that can be used to design tune experiment and evaluate various sanitization algorithms and inference attacks on location data as well as to visualize the resulting data Most of the algorithms used to conduct an inference attack represent good candidates to be abstracted in the MapReduce formalism For instance we have designed MapReduced versions of sampling as well as the means and the DJ-Cluster clustering algorithms and integrate them within the framework of GEPETO These algorithms have been implemented with Hadoop and evaluated on a real dataset Preliminary results show that the MapReduced versions of the algorithms can efìciently handle millions of mobility traces Currently the clustering algorithms that we have implemented can be used primarily to extract the POIs of an individual from his trail of mobility traces which correspond only to one possible type of inference attack In the future we aim at integrating other inference techniques within the MapReduced framework of GEPETO In particular we want to develop algorithms for learning a mobility model out of the mobility traces of an individual such as Mobility Markov Chains MMCs In a nutshell a MMC represents in a compact way the mobility behavior of an individual and can be used to predict his future locations or even to perform deanonymization attacks thus extending the range of inference attacks available within GEPETO We also want to design MapReduced versions of geo-sanitization mechanisms such as geographical masks that modify the spatial coordinate of a mobility trace by adding some random noise or aggregate several mobility traces into a single spatial coordinate More sophisticated geo-sanitization methods will also be integrated at a later stage such as spatial cloaking techniques and mix zones A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was funded by the location privacy activity of EIT ICT labs Experiments presented in this paper were carried out using the Gridê5000 experimental testbed being developed under the INRIA ALADDIN development action with support from CNRS RENATER and several Universities as well as other funding bodies see https://www.grid5000.fr R EFERENCES  The Apache Hadoop Project http://www hadoop.or g  The Apache Mahout Frame w ork http://mahout.apache.or g  The Hadoop MapReduce Frame w ork http://hadoop.apache.or g mapreduce  L O Alv ares V  Bogorn y  B K uijpers J A F  de Mac 032 edo B Moelans and A A Vaisman A model for enriching trajectories with semantic geographical information In

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rollingÖ I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todayís cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlightís data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlightís hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlightís method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
