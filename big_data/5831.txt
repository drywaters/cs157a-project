Progress New York Univeristy Email huy.vo@nyu.edu Abstract Data obtained from New York Citys Taxi  Limousine Commission highlights the importance of yellow cabs in the citys transportation infrastructure In 2011 for example there were nearly 180 million cab rides In this paper we provide detailed visualizations of these numerous journeys Using a random sample we also develop several relevant economic metrics For example we nd that nearly half of all rides were taken by a single passenger traveling short distances In contrast out-of-pocket costs faced by passengers averaged less than 6 per mile with 90 paying less than 8 per mile even when the social value of the citys roads is highest From a city planners perspective the current fare structure for yellow cabs may not be optimal Finally we propose a statistical method to analyze dynamic ow patterns of yellow-cab rides that can ultimately be extended to a multivariate model I I NTRODUCTION In Manhattan yellow taxicabs cabs seem ubiquitous They appear in almost all of the numerous movies lmed in New York City NYC and an award-winning situation comedy was devoted to the cabbie profession In NYC the Taxi  Limousine Commission TLC licenses all yellow cabs through a medallion system which allows it to regulate fares and standards TLC reports that there were 13,237 licensed yellow cabs on NYCs roads in 2011 1 Each yellow cab typically operates on a shift schedule with two or more different drivers per day which permits a single cab to be in near-continuous daily operation Data were obtained from the TLC on all yellow cab rides in 2009 2011 and 2012 The focus of this study is 2011 during which there were nearly 180 million yellow cab rides When a cab picks up passengers curb side its meter records detailed information about the journey that is ultimately relayed to the TLC This information includes the time longitude and latitude of the pick-up and drop-off location as well as the number of passengers the fare including tolls and taxes the tip if a credit card is used as well as a trips piecewise linear distance and duration We have developed animated visualizations and summary statistics of these journeys to demonstrate the important role that yellow cabs play in NYCs transportation infrastructure We examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of these journeys We also develop useful economic metrics to examine whether from a planning perspective the current fare schedule is optimal Finally we propose a statistical approach to examine the dynamic patterns of yellow cab journeys  1

review is outside of the scope of this workshop paper In brief as with other areas of economics transportation economics deals with the allocation of scarce resources in a transportation network People and goods ow through transportation networks at certain speeds along de“ned paths and a single trip may involve the use of multiple modes of transportation Modeling the demand for transportation amounts to the thought experiment of an individual making a choice among a set of discrete and nite alternatives An individual will choose the option that yields the highest bene“t Not surprisingly this modeling approach is called discrete choice theory the econometrics of which was developed and advanced by economist Daniel McFadden More information can be found in Regarding the analysis of taxi data several efforts have been done in recommendation systems  modeling 5  and visual analytics 9 10 Only 10 ho we v e r  examined yellow cab data for NYC focusing on visual exploratory tasks In this paper we look at the data from a hypothetical policy planners perspective using various metrics to begin to understand better the role yellow cabs play in NYCs transportation infrastructure The visualizations here supplement those in III M ILLIONS OF J OURNEYS A One Day in the Life of a Yellow Cab There were nearly 180 million yellow cab journeys throughout NYC in 2011 With only about 13,000 yellow cabs on the road this implies that each cab is making nearly 14,000 journeys each year Figure 1 maps out a day in the life of a single yellow cab On April 30th 2011 this yellow cab made curb-side pickups of 58 total passengers who paid 650 in total fares In Figure 1\(a hired trips from the yellow cab are highlighted in red Because our data does not include GPS tracking for each trip we constructed plausible routes by utilizing fastest paths based on speed limits Figure 1\(b shows a similar visualization but also includes journeys when the taxi is roaming free without a passenger Hired trips were marked with blue lines while empty trips were marked with red lines This combined visualization expresses how much time and distance a taxi spent looking for passengers compared to fare-generating time and distance Animations are available 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 22

while Figure 5 and 6 display them by day of week and by time of day 24-hour clock respectively Yellow cab rides are fairly uniform throughout the year We have con“rmed that 2011 is consistent with other years They reach a slight peak in March and a slight trough in August In January 2011 the average air temperature at JFK Airport was about 30  F 7 Peak temperatures were not reached until July and August with averages of 79  F and 75  F respectively Those months also recorded maximum temperatures that exceed 90  F As a result it appears that yellow cab rides are largely invariant to temperature We continue to explore the role of rainfall but we do not believe that general weather conditions are a strong driver of cab rides so to speak In 2011 nearly 51 million tourists visited NYC 8 We are exploring whether seasonal variation in tourist patterns help to explain the monthly variation seen in Figure 4 We think this implausible largely because tourism in NYC typically peaks in July and August Turning to daily characteristics Figure 5 in contrast with Figure 4 shows a clear pattern The distribution of yellow cab rides rises steadily throughout the work week About 12.5 of rides occurs on Sunday which is lower than one would expect if journeys were uniform over the week indicated by the horizontal line This share rises by 2.5 points to its Friday peak In terms of the total daily trips taken this difference amounts to approximately 12,000 yellow cab rides Again the temporal pattern here is clear yellow cab rides are concentrated late in the week with nearly one-third of all cab rides taken on Friday and Saturday Figure 6 displays a histogram of journeys by hour which demonstrates the most temporal variability The share of journeys declines steadily from midnight to 5AM As the morning rush hour begins at 6AM however the volume of journeys rises markedly This level is largely sustained throughout the day albeit with a small dip at 4PM which may be associated with the shift change in yellow cab drivers Journey volume again ramps up with the evening rush hour which TLC de“nes to be 4 to 6PM Peak volume however is reached at 7PM declining steadily thereafter only to resume the cycle The sustained volume throughout the day together with a 7PM peak suggests that the current TLC de“nition of rush hours may not be optimal C Journey Characteristics We now turn to importance characteristics of yellow cab journeys in NYC particularly in Manhattan There is a striking but simple characterization a single passenger slowly traveling a short distance This bit of New York fokelore is correct Figure 7 displays a histogram of the number of passengers for a given ride Figure 8 displays a kernel density plot or probability density function of the distance in miles of a given journey From Figure 7 we nd that nearly 70 of yellow cab journeys are occupied by a single passenger This share spikes between 6 to 8AM hours the TLC designates to be morning rush hour During these hours nearly 80 of journeys are  7 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA 8 http://www.nycandcompany.org/research/nyc-statistics-page 0 2.5 5 7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20 Percent BR CH EV FD GD GR GV HK LES MID OIM QN SO UES UWS WV Distribution of Pick Up Location Fig 2 Distribution of pickup location 0 2.5 5 7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20 Percent BR CH EV FD GD GR GV HK LES MID OIM QN SO UES UWS WV Distribution of Drop Off Location Fig 3 Distribution of drop off location occupied by only a single passenger another fact that suggests variability is not driven by tourism The high share of single passengers implies that on a daily basis cabs carry far fewer than one million passengers In contrast New Yorks Metropolitan Transit Authority MTA reports that in 2011 NYCs subway system carried nearly 4.5 million passengers per day while MTA buses running throughout NYC carried over 1.8 million passengers 9 Figure 8 displays a density plot of the distance of cab rides omitting the density beyond 10 miles Note that this is a probability density function not a cumulative density function from which one could readily read percentiles The mode of the distribution falls almost exactly at one mile The average distance is 2.1 miles and slightly over 70 of journeys are 2.5 miles or less Simply put this is a highly skewed but important characterization Yellow cab journeys are overwhelmingly short distance Figure 9 displays a density plot of the average speed in miles per hours MPH for a cab journey Recall that a yellow cab meter measures piecewise linear distance which is not necessarily the same thing as the distance between two locations For example a yellow cab traveling one mile east along 42nd Street and turning north on 8th Avenue to 9 http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership 24

method of analysis given a cab ride begins in a particular location what is the likelihood that it ends in the same or some other location If such dynamic transitions do not depend the next to last journey we call such likelihoods a rst-order Markov process For example if the likelihood a cab goes from Midtown to the Upper East Side does not depend on the fact that it previously picked up and dropped off in the Upper West Side then the process can be called a rstorder Markov Given the structure of these data it is trivial to use higher-order Markov processes For our purposes here the rst-order approach is satisfactory The use of Markov processes has become widespread in dynamic stochastic modeling For example its use is ubiquitous in macroeconomics dynamic stochastic general equilibrium nance dynamic asset pricing and areas of microeconomics dynamic programming Formally a Markov process  X t  is a stochastic process with the property that given the outcome of X t  the outcomes of X s for s>t are unaffected by the outcomes of X u for u<t  Our discussion of Markov processes is deliberately brief For a thorough treatment see The probability that outcome j is observed this period given outcome i was observed last period is called a one-step transition probability customarily denoted P ij  P  X t  j  X t  1  i t  1 X t  2  i t  2    P  X t  j  X t  1  i t  1  t 1 If the one-step transition probabilities are stationary they can be arrayed into a square matrix with a dimension that is determined by the number of possible and nite outcomes For example if there are J possible outcomes the transition probability matrix has dimension J  J with elements that determine the probability of transitioning from the row outcome to the column outcome Naturally a row sum is equal to 1 A Markov process is completely de“ned by its transition probability matrix and some initial starting condition X 0 For a complete application of this statistical approach to dynamic land use see Using the neighborhood location discussed above our Markov transition probability matrix would be 16  16 with on-diagonal elements capturing the likelihood that a yellow cab ride began and ended in the same neighborhood We refer to these probabilities as unconditional as they are simply the observed outcomes Figure 13 displays the Markov transition matrix We nd several salient features of these unconditional probabilities For example the probability a cab ride begins and ends in Brooklyn is 52 while that for Queens is 60 Recall we have excluded journeys to and from airports Consider that if these Markov states were represented with a 16-sided die the probability of any outcome on a roll would be 6.25 Therefore these two intra-location transition probabilities are extraordinarily large None of the other 14 on-diagonal transition probabilities are nearly as large This suggests that particular yellow cab drivers may specialize in intra-neighborhood journeys a subject that we are currently exploring We also nd that the on-diagonal elements are 13 for Chelsea 12 for Gramercy 22 for Midtown 32 for the Upper East Side and 31 for the Upper West Side These ndings reinforce the point that yellow cab journeys are short distance In contrast a journey starting in Soho is likely to end anywhere else including Soho almost uniformly For future iterations of this work we are developing a multivariate Markov model that will allow us condition the transition probabilities on a number of independent covariates from other data sources For example information from the U.S Census allows us to compute population density which normalizes the differences in land area as well as concentrations of business establishments We will also be able to include information on weather conditions by hour in NYC which will provide a time-varying determinant that is common to all yellow cab journeys Ultimately we intend to develop a simulation model based on the transition probabilities to examine whether and how the distribution of journeys would be affected by alternative fare structures and tolls V C ONCLUSION The visualizations in this paper highlight the important role that yellow cabs play in NYCs transportation infrastructure As shown however this role typically appears to be limited to picking up a single passenger and transporting her slowly over a short distance The out-of-pocket cost she should expect to pay is less 6 per mile and almost certainly less than 8 per mile even when the social value of the citys roads is highest Given the richness of these data we propose a statistical method to analyze dynamic ow patterns of taxi rides that can ultimately be extended to a multivariate model A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors thank the Taxi  Limousine

Using our large citation data set we also perform speedup experiments on a Hadoop platform using 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 computer nodes. The experimental results are shown in Figure 4, where it is observed that speed-up ratio is rising with the increasing of no des. In particular, time on twelve nodes cost more than that on two nodes when Microbloggers size is 100. The reason is that when the cloud platform dealing with small amount of data, the cost of task scheduling an d network communication overhead outperforms the time saving from nodes increments. However, with the increment of the data scale, the speedup shows reasonable parallel efficiency with 10 Fig 4: Speedup ratios on different scale data in cloud platform

In the framework, features are extracted for capturing user social influence quantitatively through statistical analysis on the Microblog gers relations. And then Tensor factorization is employed to infer users implicit users relations. Furthermore, a distribu ted learnin g algorithm has been implemented un der the Map-reduce programming model. Finally, a user influence ranking function is constructed for computing user social influence in user influence ranking component Experiments on Sina Weibo dataset \(Chinese Microblogging platform\ show that our proposal significantly not only improves the prediction accuracy compared with two baseline methods, but also has competitive advant age for processing ma ssive data from Microblogging

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
