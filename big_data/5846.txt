Enabling e-services based on affective exer gaming, social media and the semantic web a multitude of projects serving the citizen-centric vision for ICT in support of pHealth Panagiotis Bamidis Lab of Medical Physics, Dept. of Medic ine, School of Health Sciences, Aristo tle University of Thessaloniki, Greece   Abstract Recent studies and workshops have stressed the fundamental importance of providing harmonised health and social care services that meet the extended needs of the individual, taking into account diversity in need, preferences, ability and support. For a real caring society, the notion of "information sharing" becomes clearly crucial when communication and interaction in health care is needed. This paper revisits recent funded projects undertaken by our team, in view of the socalled coordination of planned activities for elderly/disabled care and independent living s upport. Three development pillars are taken under consideration herein, namely, affective exergaming services for senio rs/disabled, so cial media and the semantic web. Outputs from a multitude of projects are then used to provide evidence of how issues recently encountered under the so-called blue line dimensions are tackled these are technological interoper ability, semantic integration modern interfaces, people needs/expectations and societal incentives. As the latter synthesize a con-temporary puzzle of personalised health care approach, this paper provides an innovative perspective of inte rlinking developments and outputs of research in view of improving healthcare Keywords Affective computing; exergami ng; ambient assisted living social media; semantic web; linked data; big data; Education Medical; carer support; personalised healthcare Introduction Cognitive, communication and social impairments are amongst the largest problems of today\222s European healthcare and economic development. For instance, autism and dementia are among the most significant deficiencies that are associated with hospitalization, extensive and continuous treatment and/or lack of daily functionality and independent living European demographic surveys reveal that the number of people  aged 65+ has nearly doubled during the last four decades and it is expected that Europe will have around 173 million people aged 65+ by 2050. Rea lising the critical issues of our ageing society, different initiatives have developed comprehensive RTD roadmaps for active ageing by consolidating and extending existing and emerging technological solutions in close interaction with relevant stakehol  There has also been a growing focus on th e value of ehealth and telecare interventions for improving quality and cost-effectiveness of care for people with long term complex health and social care needs [2 Moreover, in a report on the EC Public On-line Consultation conducted back in Heal t h and Soci al C a re Sy st em s as well as "the Ageing Population" were rated as among the few most important societal challenges requiring ICT innovation over the next decade. In the same report, "Web based services" were identified as the main business applications to drive ICT developments in the next decade, while the notion of integration of subcomponents and systems also seemed to be a key aspect for future ICT developments likewise Undoubtedly, we live in a world in change. The following table summarises some of the pa st and present facts for the ageing society and its web technology support Table 1 - Ageing Society and the Web: Past and Present Facts Id Past Present 1 World of people as usual Ageing Society 2 223Pathetic\224 use of web web1.0 Collaborative/dynamic web2.0 3 205of growing information & content Media/Information rich 4 Data and Information highly unstructured less unstructured, and linked data / big data web3.0 5 Limited nonpharmaceutical trials Numerous interventions 6 Unfriendly technologies More user friendly 7 Limited evidence based interventions In request/need of evidence; evidence builds up slowly but surely 8 Separated ICT from other technologies Fusion of technologies at user end / integration  In such an environment, the obvious challenge for any government has been to propose ways to extend provision of health and social care services for citizens, while at the same time as improving their quality and reducing costs. Large scale randomised controlled trials of tele-care and e-health have recently demonstrated th at these technologies can support quality and efficiency improvements if they are implemented properly On anot her front desi gners are usi ng inclusive design techniques to find out what older and disabled people find difficult when using current products and services and to incorporate thos e findings into social services    But according to the Ancient Greek theory of mankind, humans consist of the triptych "Body, mind, soul/psyche". So how can contemporary technology and research exploit this 978-1-4799-3163-7/13/$31.00 \2512013 IEEE 


fact? Is there a scope for introducing the notion of emotions into the design of social servi ces? Can they play a role and prove to be useful in ageing or in assistance to disabled Recent reviews on affective me dicine [5] and the growing research interest worldwide for this new domain provide an affirmative answer to the aforementioned questions In tandem to the above views, the society has witnessed the explosion of social media and their inevitable incorporation in health care and social support. However, the use of all kinds of technological artefacts for electronic and mobile health and personal health systems generate an ever increasing am So, the aim of this paper is threefold. First to re-examine recent research outputs and current research developments undertaken in funded projects;  second, to collate the developed therein enabling e-services along the notions of emotion physical and cognitive training, gaming, social networking and the semantic web services; finally, through this multitude of projects, to synthesise a vision of sustainably serving the citizen through the use of ICT, thereby supporting the key role and prospects of personalised health \(pHealth Materials and Methods A recent analysis by the Casemi x project, has identified five 5\major issues, which are key factors when considering a holistic approach of the delivery of health and social services Jacob Hofdijk used the notion of "a Hug and a Kiss" to illustrate that the systems in question are mainly to improve the quality of life [7 e n o tio n o f b lu e lin e d i m en s io n s was coined in to model this appro ach. These dimensions are technological interoperability, semantic integration, modern manmachine interfaces, people needs and expectations and societal incentives. So in essence, the concept of the Blue Line was engineered to link the different dimensions created and provide the base to link people, system  Horizontally  to this concept, three technological development pillars are taken under considera tion herein, namely: \(i tive exergaming, that is emotion and affect fused with physical and cognitive exercises thr ough computer games; \(ii cial services for seniors and disabled through social media iii\e integrative and interoperable role of semantic web services in exploiting the richness of big data This paper uses the following funded projects, listed in Table 2, as a vehicle in touching upon the aforementioned dimensions Table 2 - Funded research projects under consideration \(coordinated by the author Id Project Name and website Key Objectives/Goals 1 Affection kedip.med.auth.gr/affect ion Develop the scientific basis for emotion detection from multi-modal data; demonstrate avatars and services that  exploit emotion recognition 2 Autism kedip.med.auth.gr/autis m To create a web based game like communication platform facilitating an emotional \(responsive 3 STHENOS to develop humancentered computers which will be able to understand the human state \(identity, emotions and motions\ng audiovisual and biological signals.

The analysing view Pillar 1: emotions and affective exergaming We have previously touched upon the role of emotions. Affective computing \(AC\is the scientific discipline that is concerned with emotional interactions performed with and through computers. It is defined as \223computing that relates to arises from, or deliberately infl uences em one of the most significant issues within AC is the underlying relation between emotions and human health, both mental and physical. Moreover, as human em otions may be expressed and communicated through various channels like text \(contextual speech face expressions and body gestures \(visual\ and internal physiological changes \(blood pressure, skin sweating, etc could effectively use such communication tips and realize contemporary interactions through multimodal sensing and expressing of affect. It is generally true, that if something makes people happier, they would like to use it frequently; at the end of the day, it is good for human health. It also true that regular physical exercise significantly improves physical functioning of individuals at any age. Engagement of elderly individuals in regular physical exercise programs has demonstrated improvement in cognition and psychological well being among other benefits  So, if one has robust scientific methods and tools to study emotions \(detect, recognise, classify, identify its origin etc Table 2: Affection and Sthenos projects\hen it is easy to explore different ways of exploiting the emotions; for example, one can imagine its subsequent fusion with systems like avatars \(Table 2: Affection and Autism projects\and devices like physical activity equipment \(Table 2: LLM project\or interactive Smart TVs or slate ta blet PCs \(Table 2:  USEFIL project For the activities to become even more attractive to users projects like the above use the notion of digital gaming, supporting user experience informed by principles of gameplay, narratives and simulations. A serious game is most widely understood as a digital game having purposes other than pure entertainment \(sometimes called edutainment=education + entertainment  or  exergam i ng= \(phy si cal  se + gam i ng   Pillar 2: social services for seniors and disabled through social media A social network constitutes the collection of interpersonal ties that individuals maintain and that provide them with several possible benefits, such as the augmentation of selfconcept, fostering of feelings of belonging, and the provision of cognitive guidance and tangible assistance in fulfilling the tasks of daily living. Online social networks currently lie at the research frontier with respect to older persons and usability. There are technical barriers to entry that must be levelled Beyond that, specifically with respect to social networks there is a cultural context that needs to be understood Experience provides evidence th at the main reason for the older or a disabled person\222s exclusion so far from ICT advances, is associated with the fact that they do not or cannot use to the same degree IT and communication technologies which are used by mainly younger or healthier/normal people This is mostly attributed to the fact that these tools are too difficult to be managed or unde rstood by older persons. Coining in the aspect of ease of use interfaces in the form of avatar agents \(Table 2: Affection project\ble level of emotional touch \(Table 2: LLM project\o be beneficial Moreover, it is true that virtual communities \(i.e. groups of people connecting via web\nning to form in relation to disease or illness. However, a classification of online social networks is still missing with respect to the functionality/service available via these i ndividual social media tools Interventions or studies that attempt to extrapolate how different \221affordances\222 offered by vari ous social networks are associated with specific needs of groups of patients are still missing. This affects the mode of interaction as well. By utilising social media as a health management tool one could reflect on this and improve the approach \(Table 2: Sthenos and LLM projects Moreover, other forms of social media and particularly semantic wikis have been lately been used by different online health related professional and educational services. Semantic wikis further extent the usual notion of a collaborative Wiki with the incorporation of \223semantic technologies\224 \(i.e. the notion of exploiting and enriching existing navigational links with symbols that describe their meaning, that is semantic annotations [11]. Capitalisi ng on such technologies, recent research endeavours have allo wed for and presented contemporary tools designed to aid doctors and patients in identifying interventions commonly associat ed with specific attributes e.g. diagnoses Tabl e 2 m E ducat or project  h at  way activities needed to implement and document care as provided to the individual patient may be entered into a portal through a \223Wikipedia-like\224 web-based tool that provides methods for organizing thought processes for clinical decision making, or delivery of individualized patient care, or simply support of the carer through guidelines \(Table 2: DISCOVER project Pillar 3: semantic web services in exploiting the richness of big data The u ltitude of scientists from different disciplines are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people things and their interactions The semantic web was developed to provide a \223smart\224 solution to this end, that is for linking and searching data and resour ces. This takes place through the connection of structured data th at arise either from an application or from primary descriptions of data, i.e. Linked data   Em phasi s has now been shi f t e d on t h e connect i v i t y of knowledge, information and resources. Resources from different repositories may now be connected and related. To this extend the mEducator project \(Table 2 has upgraded resource sharing, retrieving, re-using and repurposing to the era of semantic web while maintaining key assets of the social web/media. In this way, like in the case of semantic wikis web resources may be linked with information from nonpharmaceutical healthcare interv entions \(for seniors or disabled\ or even with more formal/clinical interventions/trials or even drug trial results. By maintaining collaborative technologies \(web 2.0\n the loop \(see Table 2: mEducator\the user sharing experience is fostered Figure 1 is attempting a collating view of Table 2, as well as the afore-described details, in an illustrative and synthesising manner. For instance, the obtained background scientific knowledge on emotions \(Affection, Sthenos, Autism\ay be exploited for the integration of emotion or person status/situation detection \(USEFIL\d result into a suggested feedback or prompting for an intervention \(LLM\ enriched with knowledge and experience sharing in terms of

It clarifies the policy domain and outlines the vision for eHealth in Europe, in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Digital Agenda for Europe  and addresses t h e fol l o wi ng operat i onal object i v es  achieving wider interoperability of eHealth services supporting research, development and innovation in eHealth and wellbeing to addr ess the lack of availability of user-friendly tools and services facilitating uptake and ensuring wider deployment promoting policy dialogue and international cooperation on eHealth at global level Although there is one-to-one correspondence between the above mentioned Blue Line dimensions, there is an obvious overlap. But let us attempt to itemise these dimensions again in Table 3 and link them with the advances, developments or impacts the afore described projects have brought about Table 3 - Relation of projects to Blue Line dimensions  Blue Line Dimension 7 Project Attributes achivements considered 1 technological interoperability Development of modular and open\tectures XML based web services; scalable solutions 2 semantic integration Use of ontological schemata; semantic annotations of collaborative/dynamic \(web2.0 data and information semantic web services linked data principles 3 modern man-machine interfaces \(or else humans and society Media/Information rich multi-modal interactions affective interfaces; human like avatar interfaces 4 people needs and expectations Inclusion principles; emphasis on improving quality of life through measured interventions 5 societal incentives Start from personal incentives; design systems that make people happier and more sociable measure effect through trials and indices  For instance, there is common be lief regarding the beneficial role of physical activity on mood, anxiety and depression Several studies have attempted to improve the socioemotional skills of older people and to neutralize their negative feelings through physical activity intervention programs. Despite reporting an antidepressive and anxiolytic effect, they failed to come to a definitive conclusion due to the lack of a concrete methodological framework. In the LLM project, the system design followed but also the pilots deployment has provided evidence for a wide acceptance of the system by its senior users, as well as, effective end results against depression and its associated cognitive decline [16, 17, 18 Th e fo llo win g  figure is attempting to illustrate the above synt hesis by linking the blue line dimensions to the various projects we have been involved  Figure 2 - A synthesised view of the projects along the five \(5 blue line dimensions Discussion This visionary paper has attempted to demonstrate that innovative and contemporary technological approaches \(the three pillars used in the analysisng view\ay give rise to systems that serve the society in the prescribed \(by formal policy documents It is obvious that a closer look at the societal needs and a more detailed analysis of the problem under consideration is going to provide the scientific community with many key recipes for the future advancement of pe rsonalised health systems Key issues to consider every time, and in view of the above descriptions are the following though 


1. There exists great tools /enabling technologies available but are they marketable, su stainable and effective 2. How does one filter which of them is suitable for his/her needs? This is where one needs scientifically sound methodologies to measure the impact in all different aspects \(health business, technically etc 3. It is usually the proper combination of technologies/interventions that may be innovative but also more effective. The excellent results pr oduced by the LLM project example provides a useful example and tutorial on how one could adjust effectiveness m easures according to needs 4. pHealth systems need to cr eate measurable added values but also synergies between different disciplines 5. There is always a dilemma between innovation versus simplicity and/or application of known systems. Moreover, there is always a fight or dilemma of doing business or science \(especially in recent recession and financial crisis times solution to this end though seems to be \(stemming from our current from experience\hat exploitation of scientific and technological innovation may lead to proper \(and sustainable business solutions which may in turn fight against recession effectively Finally, if some advice is to be drawn on how to address the issue of the incentive based po licy changes that are much needed nowadays to redesign h ealth and social care provision and really emphasise it person-centered prospects, then that could be first based on a holistic approach. That is, one needs to consider contemporary tools to initiate the process of change \(paradigm changes\  in addition one should also follow technology changes \(continuously\th transparent user utterances, while allowing for easy access, flexible \(customisable\s. last but not least, a key concept remains the constant need to evaluate extensively. To this end trials/interventions with measured outcomes would provide the necessary evidence much n eeded for pHealth systems today Acknowledgments This work has been partially funded by the European community\222s 7th framework programme \(USEFIL, grant agreement no. 223920\he eContentPlus programme \(mEducator project, grant ECP 2008 EDU 418006 LongLastinMemories project no.   \l as, national grand from the Greek Secretariat for Research and Technology \(Affection project, \he Ministry of Education \(Autism and Sthenos projets References 1  Guidelines for roadmap implementation, Deliverable 6.3 The BRAID Project - Bridging Research in Ageing and ICT Development: http://www.br aidproject.eu/; last access Sep 2012 2  Sanders C, Rogers A, Bowen R, Bower P, Hirani S, Cartwright M, Fitzpatrick R, Knapp M, Barlow J, Hendy J Chrysanthaki T, Bardsley M. and Newman SP.

the subject the person the event the time interval or the location that this statement is about who authored the sentence where and when this statement is made and whether that statement is extracted from some other internet source etc For example in the time dimension we need to capture two notions of time for a given statement 1 when that statement is published or written i.e its transaction time and 2 when the facts in the statement took place i.e its valid time The same applies for the space dimension Two space dimensions need to be extracted 1 the physical location of the person who published the statement i.e the statementês transaction location and 2 the location where the facts in the statement took place i.e its valid location The same is true for the person who wrote the statement and the person that the statement states facts about etc G Challenge 7 Data Change Frequency It is important to identify when a knowledge cube updates its Linked Data Linked Data is very dynamic in nature where its resources are added removed or updated very frequently especially in the Web of Data Therefore it is important to investigate measures of freshness for the content and interlinked resources For example the Linked Data of the cube may indicate certain properties for triples that might conîict with others that are later retrieved as new data Identifying these conîicts and creating policies of how to handle them is a crucial issue Adding provenance can be one solution to this issue However it raises another question of what version of the data to present as an answer to the query A study by Umbrich et al identiìes the characteristics of change over Linked Data and compares the change frequency in the Web of Data versus the traditional Web HTML documents  VII C ONCLUSION We present a vision for the knowledge cube architecture that motivates understanding the semantics of the data as a means for solving some of the research challenges we face today speciìcally in Big Data We motivate the use of Linked Data as a mean for achieving this target given the rich semantics that Linked Data provides We present a strawman design that sketches the possible components of a knowledge cubes system Each presented component conveys a high-level overview about its potential usage scenarios We illustrate some of the challenges and potential solutions associated with the knowledge cubes proposal Finally we demonstrate how the proposed architectural components can be used to tackle the ve pillars of Big Data A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was

Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
