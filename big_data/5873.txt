general overview of the overall network But to ensure overal l improvement we have to ensure improvement over each and every cell area supported by each single multi-antenna element CAN Here we consider the case of a single cell area served by a single multi-antenna CAN supporting multiple MTs When perfect channel state information is available at the HCC CSIT and MTs CSIR the dirty paper coding DPC scheme is the optimal capacity attaining scheme for MUMIMO downlink DPC is impracticable to implement because of the high computation complexity due to non linearity Linear beam forming techniques although are suboptimal approaches but they help to reduce the computational complexity In the authors proposed a precoding scheme based on signal to leakage-noise ratio SLNR SLNR is a transmitter side performance measure In comparison with co channel interference CCI which represents the amount of signal power received from unwanted MTs to the desired MT SLNR represents the amount of signal power from the desired MT leaked onto other MTs It has been shown in that SLNR performs better than a simple zero-forcing ZF scheme With linear beamforming the number of transmitting antennas should be greater than or equal to all the receiving antennas across all MTs unless time shared In our Fi-Wi architecture we assume that the number of antennas across all MTs are larger than the number of antennas at the CAN and hence only a subset of MTs get served at a particular time slot One of the driving objectives for such a hybrid Fi-Wi indoor network architecture is to maximize the system throughput SINR scheduling in this case serves as the most instinctive objective as maximization of SINR directly relates to maximizing system capacity SINR is a MT parameter The work in this paper is an extension of our previous work which accounts for the QoS oriented network capacity improvement under perfect CSIT assumption assuming equal power allocation policy for the users Our paper models a downlink MU-MIMO for Fi-Wi indoor environment supporting SLNR precoding and scheduling at the HCC under imperfect CSIT Based on the MMSE alteration on the imperfect CSIT we obtain a close approximate estimate of the CSIT For supporting individual QoS across MTs we make use of our previously proposed Fair-SLNR scheduling algorithm W e also propose a mathematical lo wer bound on the achievable sumrate due to imperfect estimation of CSIT Further the comparison of the Fair-SLNR scheme under equal power allocation EPA and channel adaptive power allocation CAPA is compared in terms of information theoretic parameter network capacity and average network bit error rate The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 introduces the system model Section 3 describes the channel modi\002cation using MMSE estimation Section 4 gives an overview of our Fair-SLNR scheme which was introduced in Section 5 provides a mathematical lower bound on the achievable sumrate under imperfect CSIT Section 6 talks about channel adaptive power allocation policy Section 7 discusses the simulation results and Section 8 concludes the paper summarizing our main results II S YSTEM M ODEL We consider the downlink MU-MIMO scenario for FiWi indoor environment see Fig.2 where HCC is trying to communicate with K users having one antenna each via a single CAN with N transmit antennas

optical wavelength CAN is used to radiate the signals for different MTs after optical to electrical conversion As shown in Fig.2 the signals for different MTs generated at the access point AP in HCC after SLNR precoding and scheduling are optically modulated onto different wavelengths using Wavelength Division Multiplexing WDM The different optical wavelengths are then transported through the 002ber to the CAN where optical to electrical conversion is done at each individual antenna of the CAN and the signal is radiated in the cell area Different antenna elements across the CAN are thus accessed using different optical wavelengths making the system transparent For analysis we assume that the optical channel is perfect and hence introduces no error Notation  The rest of the paper uses upper case bold face for matrices and lower case bold face for vectors A T  A H and j A j are used to denote the transpose hermitian and the Frobenius norm of matrix A respectively Let h k  t  2 C 1 002 N denotes the channel gain from the antennas across the CAN to MT k at time t  Quasi-static time variant spatially uncorrelated Rayleigh fading is assumed Quasi static time varying indoor channel is a good assumption which is validated by The spatially uncorrelated channel assumption is true as we assume that the separation between the antenna elements in the CAN to be at least half wavelength apart For a speci\002c time slot t the transmitted symbol of MT k is given by x k  t   The transmitted symbol is pre-multiplied by a unit norm beamforming precoding vector b k  t   The received signal vector at MT k can thus be written as r k  t   h k  t  K X i 1 b i  t  x i  t   w k  t   h k  t  b k  t  x k  t   h k  t  K X i 6  k b i  t  x i  t   w k  t  1 where w k  t  030 N 0  033 2  represents the additive white Gaussian noise The power allocation across all the MTs are 


assumed equal which we refer as Equal power allocation p olicy EPA We also assume that the signal variance is equal to 1 and the signals for different MTs are not correlated The SLNR for MT k at time slot t can be given by SLN R k  t   j h k  t  b k  t  j 2 033 2  P i 6  k j h i  t  b k  t  j 2  2 In our previous paper we assumed perfect CSIT  But the assumption that HCC has perfect CSIT is not ideal so we try to relax the perfect CSIT assumption to an imperfect CSIT with estimation errors at the MTs In this paper we are however neglecting the imperfection in CSIT caused due to feedback delay As we assumed that the channels are quasi-static so the imperfection caused due to feedback delay is assumed to have minimal impact A Error Estimation of Channel We assume that the techniques used at the MTs for channel estimation is not perfect and it introduces error Thus the HCC will obtain CSI with error Let us denote the perfect CSI as h k  t  for user k at time t  the erroneous estimates as  h k  t  and the divergence between them as the error e k  t   h k  t  000  h k  t  3 The distribution of e k  t  are CN 0  033 2 e I   The quality of channel estimation is indicated by the error variance and is assumed to be known to both at the HCC and the MTs The degradation in performance of SLNR based scheme is signi\002cant due to error estimates in CSI We can however make minimum mean square error MMSE based alteration so that we obtain a close approximation of the CSI by reducing the effect of estimation error III C HANNEL M ODIFICATION This section aims to estimate a modi\002cation matrix of size N 002 N using the MMSE based approach to reduce the signi\002cant effect of estimation error For notational simplicity in this part we neglect the time index Let us denote the channel modi\002cation matrix as F and the full channel estimate matrix as  H  The entries of  H includes the imperfect CSI received from the MTs The equivalent channel matrix after modi\002cation can be expressed as 024 H   HF 4 The modi\002cation matrix F opt can be obtained by minimizing M SE  E h r r H 000 024 H r r 2 i satisfying power constraint can be given by F opt  argmin T r  F 003 F  1 E h r r H 000 024 H r r 2 i 5 By equating the gradient of the MSE with respect to F and equating to zero we obtain 022 F opt   K\033 2 e I  H 003 H  000 1  H 003 H  6 where H represents the full channel matrix The obtained 022 F opt is a global minimizer which can be easily proved by deriving the Hessian matrix and noticing that the Hessian matrix is positive de\002nite Normalising 022 F opt to satisfy the power constraint gives F opt  022 F opt  r T r 020 022 F 003 o pt 022 F opt 021 7 The minimum mean square error variance becomes 033 2 mod  E h r r H 000 024 H r r 2 i  033 2 e r r X i 1 025 i   025 i  033 2 e  8 where r is the rank and 025 1  025 r are the non zero eigen values of the full transmit channel covariance matrix H cov which is given as H cov  E  H 003 H  9 Therefore after modi\002cation to account for the erroneous channel state information the modi\002ed SLNR can be given as SLN R mod k  t  b 003 k  t  020 024 h 003 k  t  024 h k  t   033 2

into account the imperfection in CSI Here we also included the time index parameter The optimal solution for the precoding vector can be given as b opt k  t   maxev 020 024 h 003 k  t  024 h k  t   033 2 mod I  033 2 I  X i 6  k 033 2 mod I  024  H 003 k  t  024  H k  t  021 11 The maxev is used to represent the maximum eigen vector After obtaining the modi\002ed channel estimates and the optimal precoding vectors the next step is to precode and schedule the MTs The main goal of this paper is to maximize the network capacity based on SLNR precoding and scheduling under imperfect CSIT taking into account the quality of service\(QoS requirements that each MT demands The comparative study of the deterioration of the network capacity between perfect and imperfect CSI is presented in this paper IV F AIR SLNR SCHEDULING Here in this section we give a brief overview of our previously introduced Fair-SLNR scheduling scheme F airness plays a bigger part of network utility Greedy algorithm can ensure that the total system throughput is maximized while individual MTs throughput requirement is overlooked In real MU-MIMO broadcast scenarios HCC is likely to provide a variety of services to different users each with different QoS requirements In Fair-SLNR based scheduling  the main goal of the scheduleder is to maximize the system capacity while ensuring that a respectable individual capacity as demanded by the user is guaranteed For supporting such heterogeneous throughput fairness among users a throughput fairness metric is de\002ned for user k at time t  1 as 026 k  t   exp 020 m 026 C avg  t  000 a k 026 c k  t  030  a k 026 c k  t  021  12 where m  m 025 0 is the throughput slope of the exponential function which determines the sensitivity of the throughput fairness curve Smaller values of m means less strict 


throughput fairness among users and typically give them only a verage throughput fairness Indeed when m  0 the weighted sum-rate maximization problem reduces to normal sum-rate maximisation problem without any fairness consideration The scalar valued a k are constants to allow different throughput requirements among users The variable 030 is an appropiate small value for ensuring that the denominator is non-zero The value 026 c k  t  is the moving average of past throughput for user k which is updated as 026 c k  t   1 000 1 013  026 c k  t 000 1  1 013 C k  t 000 1  13 where 013 is the smoothing factor and C k  t 000 1 is the data rate of user k at time t  The scalar 026 C avg  t  in 12 is de\002ned as 026 C  t   1 K  K X k 1 026 c k  t  14 Any user with a k 026 c k  t   026 C  t  has a value less than 1 as its weight In this case that user might be excluded from a selected user set for transmission by weighted sum rate maximisation rule for meeting the throughput fairness constraint among MTs despite its high channel gain From time-slot two onwards the scheduling algorithm also takes in account the throughput fairness metric as described by equation 12  So as it is evident from the algorithm proposed for 002rst iteration the algorithm searches to maximize the throughput fair largest channel gain of user Once the 002rst MT is chosen in the 002rst iteration then the algorithm tries to include a single MT in every other iteration based on the maximisation of the Fair-SLNR criterion In the calculation of Fair-SLNR only the leakage power to MTs selected in the previous iteration is considered and also the throughput fairness metric for that user The throughput fairness metric takes the QoS demanded by the user into account The no of iterations per time slot is equal to the number of transmitting antennas at the CAN as stated before After scheduling the HCC broadcasts data streams of selected users using leakagebased precoding For the ease of readability the pseudo code of the algorithm is also provided in this paper which is just a mere abstraction from our previous work In the algorithm the imperfect CSIT is however taken into account and modi\002ed accordingly A comparative study on how FairSLNR scheduling algorithm fares against the Greedy-SLNR and the Random scheduling scheme can be found in our previous work V L OWER B OUND ON ACHIEVABLE SUM RATE In this section we provide a lower bound for the achievable sum rate of the system per time-slot If we replace h k of 1 by 024 h k as we only have knowledge of modi\002ed equivalent channel matrices after MMSE estimation so we can write it as follow 024 r k  t   024 h k  t  024 b k  t  x k  t   024 h k  t  X i 6  k 024 b i  t  x i  t   w k  t   024 h k  t  u k  t   X i 6  k 024 h k  t  u i  t   w k  t  15 Algorithm 1 F air-SLNR based scheduling TIME-SLOT t=1  I nitialization  S 1  f 036 g   S 1  f 1  2   K g  s 1 1  argmax k 2  S 1 j 024 h k 1 j 2  S 1  S 1 S f s 1 1 g   S 1   S 1 000 f s 1 1 g  for j=1:N-1 do 024  H j 1   024 h T s 1 1  024 h T s j S 1 j 1  T  while f or each k 2  S 1 do f ind b opt k 1 normalise b opt k 1 to unity  f ind SLN R mod k 1 end while s j 1 1  argmax k 2  S 1 f SLN R k 1 g  S 1  S 1 S f s j 1 1 g   S 1   S 1 000 f s j 1 1 g  end for TIME-SLOT t=n n  1   Initialization  S  n   f 036 g   S  n   f 1  2   K g  s 1  n   argmax k 2  S  n  026 k  n  j 024 h k  n  j 2  S  n   S  n  S f s 1  n  g   S  n    S  n  000 f s 1  n  g  for j=1:N-1 do 024  H j  n    024 h T s 1  n   024 h T s j S  n  j  n   T  while f or each k 2  S  n  do f ind b opt k  n  normalise b opt k  n  to unity  f ind F air 000 SLN R k  n   026 k  n  003 SLN R mod k  n  end while s j 1  n   argmax k 2  S  n  f F air 000 SLN R k  n  g  S  n   S  n  S f s j 1  n  g   S  n    S  n  000 f s j 1  n  g  end for where u k  t  r epresents the precoded signal that is being transmitted The data rate of MT k ignoring the time-index can be given as follow Rate k  I  u k  024 r k  16 Now taking P i 6  k 024 h k u i  w k as the resultant total noise term owing to the interference and the desired MTs receiver noise and representing it as n k we have 024 r k  024 h k u k  n k 17 Thus Rate k can be given as Rate k  E 024 h k log 022 1  j 024 h k j 2 1 N  E  n k n 003 k j 024 h k  023 025 E 024 h k l og 022 j 024 h k j 2 1 N  E  n k n 003 k j 024 h k  023  18 The inequality in equation 18 is because we assume high snr regime We replaced above E  j u k j 2  by 1 N  Thus Rate k 025 E 024 h k log 000 j 024 h k j 2 1 N  001 000 E 024 h k log 000 E  n k n 003 k j 024 h k  001 19 The inequality in 19 assumes that the resultant noise is Gaussian distributed which is the worst case possible noise distribution So replacing the resultant distribution with any other distribution will perform better Applying Jensen's Inequality we have
