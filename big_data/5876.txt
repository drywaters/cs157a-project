Image Information Mining: an Accelerated Bayesian Algorithm for Data Fusion of SAR Big Data Kevin, Alonso,   DLR German Aerospace Center, kevin.alonsogonzalez@dlr.de, Germany Mihai, Datcu,   DLR German Aerospace Center, mihai.datcu@dlr.de, Germany Abstract The paper presents a knowledge-driven content-based information mining Bayesian algorithm for data fusion of SAR Big Data. The method combines, at pixel level, the unsupervised clustering results of different number of features with a user given semantic concept. The combination has as goal to calculate the posterior probability that allows the final search. The proposed interactive learning method is able to learn different user semantic labels, which can be used to retrieve related images with a few user interactions, greatly optimizing the computational costs and over performing existing similar systems in various orders of magnitude 1  Introduction The total amount of Earth Observation \(EO\ data generated is growing every day in exponential way. Being so the only way to exploit more efficiently the existing EO Big Data archives is developing faster and more efficient new systems, technics and concepts for Content Based Image Retrieval \(CBIR In CBIR the search engines can be divided by their methodology in three main categories  Query by Example \(QE\: QE engine uses one image for querying the data base and based in one feature returns a ranking of the content. An example of this type of engine is GeoIRIS [1     Relevance Feedback \(RF\: these systems allow the user to refine their queries by specifying between interactions a set of relevant and a set of non-relevant images. A multimedia application of this type of search engine is IKONA [2   Image Information Mining \(IIM\ It is composed by Interactive Learning \(IL\, which requires as RF the participation of the users, and probabilistic retrieval. The Knowledge-driven Information Mining KIM\ system presented in [3 f o r exa m p l e s u pp ort e d  user interaction via web frontend to adaptively introduce application-specific interests. In KIM the user introduces semantic interpretation of the content which was interactively linked with hierarchical Bayesian networks to a completely unsupervised content-index. Using the result of this stochastic link, the user can query the database for relevant images and obtain a probabilistic ranking of the entire image archive as an intuitive information representation The use of probabilities offers us the advantage to fuse features from different sources and instruments. But the merging comes related with some complexity problems that must be overcome In this paper we present a new implementation of KIM algorithm based also on feature fusion and Bayesian networks for probabilistic retrieval. New theoretical and technical approaches have been implemented to overpass the scalability limitations derived from previous KIM implementations The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, an overview of the algorithm is shown. Section 3 explains theoretical aspects taken into consideration in the posterior probability calculation, and the scalability issues that rise with the merge of features. Section 4 presents the implemented different approaches for querying the database. Following, Section 5 presents some query examples and computation times. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding remarks 2  Hierarchical Model for Information Representation The information can be represented via multilevel hierarchical model, as it is shown in Figure 1. The first three levels form the not real time image analysis part which is in charge of feature extraction processes and unsupervised clustering algorithmic. For the preliminary tests Figure 1 System hierarchical levels 604 EUSAR 2014 ISBN 978-3-8007-3607-2 / ISSN 2197-4403 VDE VERLAG GMBH Berlin Offenbach, German y 


intensity and Weberís law descriptor [4 e re u s e d   I n  later tests with the fusion of features from optical data multispectral information pixel values were added The features are extracted at pixel level and after kmeans unsupervised clustering. A probability density function \(PDF\vector is generated calculating the histogram of the occurrence of the clustering classes inside the image. At the end of not real time processes the calculated PDFs are stored in a database In the third level the user interaction enters in scene. A frontend for the user is presented as query by example interface as is shown in Figure 2. There, the user can introduce positive and negative examples about the specific semantic he/she is looking for and do a search by similarity or probability of the label in the archive      Figure 2 User interface for browsing database, interactive learning and querying. The user can interact with the query image or over the probability map to give positive and negative examples. To refine the label it is possible to load as query image the ones shown as result to increase the diversity of the classes in the label definition 3  Algorithm Overview With the positive and negative examples introduced by the user, it is possible to use a simple Bayesian network to perform the probabilistic learning by means of hyperparameters. As it has been mentioned before, the searches in the database are done via posterior probabilities. We can calculate posterior probabilities as  1 which can be also expressed applying Bayesí formula as  2 Being the prior probability of the semantic label  the probability of the classes in the data the probability of the classes in the label which can be expressed as the PDF of the classes updated with the user inputs, and the prior of signal classes  as   3 3.1  Feature Merging and Scalability In most of the cases using a unique feature is not enough to characterize a strong user-specific semantic To allow the stochastic link of different features or models the assumption of full statistic independence must be taken into account In [3 h e f u ll s t a t i s ti cal i nde pe n d e n ce as s u mp ti o n w a s  made over the features resulting in   4 As a result a relatively fast computation of the posterior probabilities was possible only if the model number used was restricted to two. The limitation was set because of the computational complexity has a polynomial increasing with the model number    5 3.2  Posterior Probability Statistical Independence The presented algorithm introduces a new statistical assumption, where the statistical independence is enhanced to include the posterior probability       6 In this way computation complexity maintains linear permitting the introduction of more features for the user-specific semantic label definition    7 In Section 5 some performance results are presented in the form of querying time, comparing the results for different retrieval methods and used statistical assumptions 605 EUSAR 2014 ISBN 978-3-8007-3607-2 / ISSN 2197-4403 VDE VERLAG GMBH Berlin Offenbach, German y 


4  Query Methods Two different query methods can be performed using the presented algorithm. The first one uses the sum of posterior probabilities of each image in the database to rank them from highest to lowest. With this method the user is able to look for images with the highest probability to have the requested semantic label inside A good example of use case for this method would be a user with an initial image of a city looking for images with trees. In this image there would be some trees in the streets and some others in a park. Putting a couple of positive examples over the trees and making a search the user would get as result for his/her query images of forest or great parks full of trees. All of them, images with a very high probability of having trees inside The second method relies on vector similarity to rank the database images. The similarity measure in this case is done by the comparison among the posterior probability PDF of the querying image and the PDF of classes of the images in the database. In this way, instead of pure image similarity among the classes PDF, we are introducing the user-specific semantic as a very strong factor that reshapes query image class PDF powering up the classes related with the requested semantic The difference factor with the other method is clear inspecting the query results. The first one returns images with higher probability of having the user defined label The later, offers images similar to the query image in shape and in label probability 5  Results and Evaluation In this section some preliminary results of the system are presented. These results are on one hand related to the quality of the images returned and on the other hand related to system performance taking into account the query response time 5.1  Query Examples In Figure 3 some query examples are presented. The first image corresponds to the query image; the second one is the visualization of the posterior probability in map form. This map represents posterior probabilities of a given user-specific semantic. The map is a grey scale representation of the pixel posterior probabilities of the image, being black means probability 0 and white 1. For usability purposes probabilities above 0.9 are drawn in red. The next images are the first ranked results Example a shows a query looking images with the user-specific semantic of the river. For this search only two positive examples were introduced by the user. Also notice that the ranking was done by similarity Figure 3 Different query examples using SAR image features.

Example b presents a query searching the user-specific semantic tree. As it can be appreciated, the query image has lines of trees along some streets and a bunch of them among residential buildings. In that case the user introduced again two positive and one negative example to get correct results for her/his query. The results ranked in this case by the label probability level in the image, show in the first places images of parks or areas in the city close to parks where the concentration of trees is greater The third query example looks for railways as userspecific semantic. This was the hardest label to define Starting from the railway image shown in Figure 3c, it was necessary not only to give positive and negative examples over this initial image but to continue refining the query, analysing partial and intermediary query image results via mainly negative examples in order to strengthen and limit the label. As in the previous case the ranking was made using the probability of the label in the images 5.2  Querying Times As mentioned before the system presented extends the search capabilities of existing KIM system speeding up the querying processes. Table 1 summarizes some of the performance tests that have been done     Ta bl e 1  System query performance time for different statistical assumptions, query ranking types and model number. First row is used as threshold and corresponds to an emulation of the original KIM implementation The difference among the performance in the case of four models using the new statistical assumption is four orders of magnitude better The first row matches the characteristic of the already existing KIM system. Thus, the first row is used as threshold to measure the impact of the newly introduced concepts. Using the same theoretical assumptions applied to the original KIM, the developed search and ranking procedure performs one order of magnitude faster than the original for the queries with one and two models; and two orders of magnitude faster for the four model query. Introducing the posterior probability statistical independence we can see that the performance time in vector similarity methods maintains constant as the size of probability matrix only depend on the model number. On the other hand for the posterior probability method we have an enormous speed up factor of one order of magnitude for single model case and of two orders of magnitude for the dual model case. These practical results confirm the theoretical results exposed in section 3 of this paper 6  Conclusions We have presented a new implementation of a KIM algorithm. For comparison purposes the original KIM methods have been implemented. Based on them, we have developed new search methodologies and theoretical probabilistic assumptions which outperform in speed the original ones. The algorithm acceleration was achieved thanks to the simplification of the operation complexity from polynomial to linear. As future works a comparison and evaluation of the obtained results are planned. The introduction of a bigger variety of features for the user-specific semantic definition is also planned Theoretically the use of a higher quantity of models would improve the quality and the robustness of the label definition. The introduction and fusion of data features from other type of images \(Optical, Multispectral Multitemporal\ is also planned References 1 C R.

  7 4   R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION  The power analysis of the MPSoC as generated by the XPower Analyzer tool from Xilinx is shown in figure 14 The estimation was carried out at an ambient temperature of 26 C  without air flow and no heat sink The estimated  maximum ambient temperature in atmospheric pressure was 78.8 C This is the estimated maximum temperature which might surround the FPGA during its operation and would not lead to exceeding the operating temperature limits. The commercial grade of the XCV 5LX50 has a recommended operating range of 0 to 85 C  The maximum die temperature is 125 C after that limit the FPGA would shut down automatically for protecting the die The estimated power consumption of the system is less than 1 Watt which is a good value for a design that contains 4 processor systems   Figure   14  XPower Analyzer estimation of the system power consumption  The temperature measurements of the sensors attached to the FPGA top surface, under the FPGA board and the target profile is shown in figure 15    Figure   15  Thermal vacuum test results for the XCV5LX50 MPSoC OBC  The sensors labels in figure 15 matches the positions labels in figure 8 and 9 The profile temperature indicates the temperature at the attachment point to the satellite structure which is also known as the mounting point This temp erature was controlled using a heater and a close loop control implemented in LABView The temperature of the FPGA top surface is almost identical for sensors 1 and 4 However sensor 1 showed slightly high values than sensor 4 as it located just on the cen ter of the FPGA The die is located in the center of the FPGA as well The die dimensions for the XCV5LX50 is 1.2mmx1.2mm The FPGA package is BGA of dimensions 27mm x 27mm Sensor 4 was located at the  top surface edge of the FPGA  The difference in tempe rature between sensor 1 and 4 is due to the heat propagation through the metal cap of the FPGA and the fact that sensor 1 is directly located above the die while sensor 4 is at the edge of the package The temperature under the FPGA showed lower values as it is 


  8 not touching the FPGA at all It is just located below the FPGA board in the space between the FPGA PCB and the base plate PCB The heater temperature measurement is shown in figure 16   Figure   1 6  Heater temperature during the tests  The shroud te mperature is shown in figure 17. The shroud top sensor showed slightly lower and stabilized readings than the shroud bottom sensor. Lower readings were due to the fact that the top sensor faces the entrance nozzle of the liquid nitrogen gas. The stabilizat ion in the sensor readings due to the heat dynamics as the liquid nitrogen propagates from top to bottom of the shroud and it is affected by the heat being emitted by the system and the heater   Figure   17  Shroud top and bottom surface temperatures  The supply of the liquid nitrogen was cut by the beginning of the high section of the second cycle. We cut the supply to save the liquid nitrogen as this part of the cycle is already in high temperature and liquid nitrogen would not affect the profile when we cut it. Therefore we decided to economize the consumption by cutting the liquid nitrogen at the beginning of the second cycle high section at the time marker \(28801\sec. Cutting the liquid nitrogen supply had the effect that the curves of the temperature sensors at the top and bottom of the shroud started to raise as shown in figure 17. Again this does not affect the profile as shown in figure 15. There is another advantage for cutting the liquid nitrogen supply at the last high cycle The temperature of t he shroud would start to raise and that would reduce the recovery time of the chamber as we can not open the chamber if its temperature is very low. typically we recover the pressure to the atmospheric pressure level and the temperature to 30  C  The syste m showed a robust operation and the curves obtained were clear and expressive The FPGA system worked flawlessly and all the interrupts were received adequately during the test time. A snapshot of the processors operation is shown in figure 18    Figure   18  Snapshot of the processors outputs  The design showed a robust performance and the operation of the test was maintained successfully The XCV5LX50 commercial grade withstood the thermal vacuum vibration test at the temperature profile set by the SMC standard   5   C ONCLUSION  In this paper we showed the thermal vacuum test setup procedure and results for an MPSoC OBC developed at Kyutech   The OBC was developed using the Virtex5 XCV5LX50 FPGA. The FPGA showed robust performance durin g the thermal vacuum tests. Although the FPGA was of a commercial grade it managed to operate at the  temperature profile from 24 C  to 60  C The FPGA temperature reached about 102 C This is a high temperature as the manufacturer recommends 85 C as a  maximum operating temperature. Thermal control should be used to attach the FPGA surface to a radiator such as heat sink or to maintain the temperature profile at the mounting point of the FPGA board to be lower than 60 C An  industrial grade FPGA might be another option as it has a wider operating temperature range from 45 C to 155 C The design that was tested shows the maximum utilization of the FPGA slices which gives a good indication about the maximum expected operating temperature of this class of FPGAs in the thermal vacuum environment of space We would repeat the tests to assess the durability of the system during long test cycles about 10 to 14 cycles Also we would use heat sink for thermal control of the FPGA  We recommend repeating the te sts on other FPGAs families and designs to enrich the literature with more data about the thermal perf ormance of COTS FPGAs in space

evidently clear that çBig Dataé has come to stay. This is 
The Linear Search and Parallel Search however shows consistent result since the focus is on the entire specified data source. The false negative values are small and the true positive index is also high. An observation however is that, the false positive and false native results in the Linear Search also re-occur in the Parallel Search. This can be attributed to the fact that the Linear Search is the underlying methodology on which the Parallel Search is running In Table IV, the result from crawling some selected websites are shown. This websites are for health care providers. Using similar types of terms from the NoSQL, we perform similar searches on the Web. The accuracy index dropped because there were higher false positive and false values. This is more likely due to the fact that the web is wide with similar written terms but with different meanings. Since not all the keywords from the web are captured in the Dictionary/Thesaurus, most of the specified terms were mislabeled In Table V, we report the results from the search in the SQL database. The data here is a fraction of the NoSQL version. The results in the structured data source show very high accuracy in comparison to the rest of the data sources This is not because the proposed framework works better with structured data source but, because the data itself is very small in comparison to the rest. Further, we know where to find most of the terms we were looking for so narrowed our database choice in the case of the Pessimistic and Optimistic Search methodologies VI C ONCLUSION With the present direction of corporate transactions, it is because most traditional business transactions which use to be paper-based are all being digitized. Besides, user generated content across different spectrum of the enterprise landscape is increasing in volume at an exponential rate. While Big Data has its tremendous advantages, the fact that the data is heterogeneous \(i.e., variety\poses new challenges Previously, the data mining and knowledge discovery in database \(KDD\procedures were designed for schema-oriented databases. However, the data today is multifaceted and has no schema. Though the NoSQL databases have been proposed to accommodate the data, not many tools are available that performs data mining and analytics from such storages Our work details an Analytics-as-a Service \(AaaS\ tool that performs terms mining and analytics from multiple data sources. Currently, the following data sources are supported NoSQL \(e.g., document style storages such as CouchDB SQL, Tag/Flat file storage \(HTML, XML, RTF\, and Textual Documents \(e.g., PDF\ Furthermore, we conducted experiments using the various styles of storage such as NoSQL, Web, and SQL. The pilot testing shows an encouraging result especially from the NoSQL domain. Our future extension aims at incorporating learning and adaptability features. This will further facilitate the ability to do recommendations for users based on their term and topic mining requirements R EFERENCES  M R WI GA N A N D R   C L A R K E  B i g D a ta  s  B i g Uni nt e nd ed Consequences," Computer , vol.46, no.6, pp.46-53, June 2013, doi 10.1109/MC.2013.195 2
