1 Lightweight Service Announcement The case for Wi-Fi M2M Service Providers Guillaume Habault   Patrick Maill  e   Laurent Toutain   Alexander Pelov   Nicolas Montavont  and Philippe Bertin   IMT/TELECOM Bretagne Universit  e Europ  eenne de Bretagne Rennes France  rstname.lastname  telecom-bretagne.eu  Orange Labs Rennes France philippe.bertin@orange.com Abstract Machine-to-Machine M2M technology enables to interconnect machines with the least possible human intervention The nature of M2M trafìc small and periodic is different from the traditional trafìc originating from computers or mobile phones big and bursty However the number of nodes involved in such technology impacts the network as it has mainly been designed for Human-to-Machine H2M communications Due to the number of involved M2M nodes and their intrinsic constraints the retrieval of M2M trafìc with existing networks is a real challenge In order to do so the authors propose a lightweight service announcement architecture re-using already deployed Wi-Fi networks This solution extends information announced in the IEEE 802.11 beacon frame It enables M2M devices to automatically detect the most appropriate network among the one discovered reduces the amount of signaling messages exchanged to do so and consequently the delay needed to collect this trafìc The feasibility study based on real-world data shows that the frequency of announcement the amount of data to send and the available density of Access Points have to be taken into account in order to use Wi-Fi networks to retrieve M2M trafìc Keywords  M2M trafìc service discovery IEEE 802.11 extended beacon I I NTRODUCTION The Machine-to-Machine  M2M  technology paradigm is built around the principle of interconnection of machines with the least possible human intervention The data trafìc generated by these new M2M applications is generally quite different from the classical Human-to-Machine  H2M  technologies M2M communications usually generate less trafìc per node than computers or mobile phones but impact the network design since the number of nodes is much higher For instance neither 3G nor even LTE networks alone can be used to interconnect all potential M2M endpoints In fact P  otsch et al sho wed that e v en the considered small M2M traf c can increased delay on best effort H2M trafìc in LTE network In addition M2M nodes that can be mobile are sleeping most of the time and wake up either when an event occurs to send some information or periodically to check if some request has arrived from the network The low-volume per endpoint periodic energy resource and costefìcient nature of the M2M trafìc is in stark contrast to the high-volume per endpoint bursty nature of the H2M communications It is thus of crucial importance to take the intrinsic M2M trafìc characteristics in the design of future communication architectures and whenever possible  adapt and optimize the existing ones Wi-Fi coverage is high in densely populated areas such as cities as shown in b u t can be subject to traf c limitations for data exchange A new concept which has been gaining popularity in the recent years is the sharing of Wi-Fi connectivity among the members of a given group  Community Networks  CN  As an example all major ISP providers in France offer to their customers the possibility to participate to ISP-wide CNs which gi v e n the signiìcant high-speed Internet penetration rate provides an almost ubiquitous access FON 1 offers the same kind of services in many countries such as U.K or Japan It is important to note that this type of service is different from the free-for-all open Wi-Fi networks as well as the ones provided by local businesses for their clients e.g a hotel providing the password to their guests Indeed in these scenarios it is difìcult to comply with the regulations in different countries e.g identifying a user for legal purposes but also to be able to guarantee acceptable performance to the users of the network and most importantly  for security reasons As a consequence the CNs are built around the notion of Virtual Wireless ISP  VW-ISP  where a dedicated well known Wi-Fi SSID Service Set IDentiìcation is announced by every participating Access Point  AP  in addition to the user-deìned one The ISP provides credentials typically user name and password but can also be based on certiìcates etc to its clients which allow them to connect to the VW-ISP The core of this paper is to deìne and study a new application of the VW-ISP approach We propose a new way to announce services in IEEE 802.11 beacons frame and so to re-use existing Wi-Fi architecture for M2M communications This is an adaptation of the ISP CNs to M2M applications and  as we show through the paper  does not require any modiìcation to the existing hardware Once again it is important to stress that the classical VW-ISP approach cannot be reused as-is for M2M communications as it relies on typical H2M characteristics The solution we propose uses the possibility to include extensions to the information announced in IEEE 802.11 beacons We detail the service announcement mechanism and its

2 role in a generic M2M service oriented architecture Our proposal is evolutionary technology-wise and opens new horizons for business applications We introduce the role of Wi-Fi M2M Service Provider  WM-SP  where an ISP can leverage its existing infrastructure to generate additional revenue sources and in the same time create an enabler for new M2M services To the best of our knowledge this is the rst time this concept is studied in detail The rest of the paper is structured as follows The related work is presented in Section II The M2M service provider architecture is then introduced in Section III We perform a feasibility study of the proposed architecture in Section IV followed by the conclusion of this paper in Section V II R ELATED WORK Deployment of M2M devices or sensors in our everyday life is increasing The traf c generated by these de vices is different from the traditional trafìc originating from a computer or a mobile phone In fact nodes are mainly sleeping only waking up to send collected data or to check for incoming requests Collecting these data is an issue to be solved due to the intrinsic constraint of these devices and their signiìcant growths prevent from using existing architecture as-is such as cellular network Solutions exist such as the one offered by the company SigFox which introduces a beaconless unidirectional access to the IMS band for M2M applications 2  However in this technology the data retrieval is performed via an Aloha-style mechanism The long radio range and the energy constraints makes the bandwidth available very limited for applications Additionally Kleinrock et al discussed slotted-Aloha stability problem and showed that  for large number of terminals  the channel can get saturated Furthermore this solution requires the deployment of a new and dedicated cellular network Even though the technology enables to cover larger area the Access Network  AN  should be updated accordingly to the growing number of such devices Density of Wi-Fi access network is increasing It has been so much expanding this past years that several research studies have been conducted to deìne new ways to beneìt from the existing wireless deployment such as in This deplo yed AN could be used to retrieve M2M trafìc since it offers much more point of attachment to the network than any other solutions and a sufìcient enough bandwidth One problem being to determine which APs support a M2M data collecting service among all the available APs Solutions such as IEEE 802.21 and IEEE 802.11u help to inform about the AN capabilities Both of them could then be used in the discovery of services availability on APs However with such protocols nodes have to exchange additional messages in order to gather the information about the different networks This information gathering need to take place prior to the selection and connection to the candidate AN In fact nodes cannot spend time connecting to an AP that will not be able to fulìll their goal  transferring M2M data Nodes have then to process information from all surrounding APs to select the most suitable one for their  2 http://www.sigfox.com/en Fig 1 Schematic view of Wi-Fi network deployment use Which once again is a loss in term of awake time signaling exchange and energy consumption  and this each time they have to send information In fact the signaling message exchanged in IEEE 802.21 represent 22 of the total transmission time on the device side W orst of all most of this time is spent for the retrieval of information regarding the AP capabilities The Wi-Fi M2M Service Provider WM-SP approach we introduce in this paper is based on a new way to announce services supported by Wi-Fi networks In addition to limiting the amount of exchanged and processed information our proposal decreases the time needed to select the correct AN and therefore the time needed to send data This is in stark contrast to the alternative approaches To the best of our knowledge this is the rst time the WM-SP concept is deìned and studied in the light of lightweight service announcement via Wi-Fi beacon options III S ERVICE CENTERED ARCHITECTURE In this paper we will be using the terms service and M2M service interchangeably We will concentrate on services that need to be deployed in areas where Wi-Fi coverage residential and/or public is already assured through one or more networks The transport of M2M trafìc will be ensured by re-using the existing networks each provider deciding which services to enable on its network M2M devices have then to be able to discover the services available on each surrounding Wi-Fi networks A Principle We propose a solution that overcomes issues of existing protocol to gather and transfer data generated by M2M devices In order to do so the solution i re-uses existing Wi-Fi networks ii advertises about available services as soon as possible without increasing the amount of message exchanged and iii enables M2M nodes to transfer their data as fast as possible Figure 1 presents a schematic view of current Wi-Fi network deployment in cities APs are set up by different providers to offer wireless Internet access However as it often depends on the willingness of their customers providers do not have 2 


3 an uniform coverage Additionally devices cannot access the Internet via any APs as they need proper credentials login/password a key to connect to it This high protection prevents from using Wi-Fi networks for other uses Our idea is to enable multiple services on subsets of APs  possibly belonging to different ISPs  to ensure an uniform coverage Each APs will have its legacy usage provide Internet access to users who have the appropriate credentials and at the same time offer a restricted access for other usages Subsets of network will then propose additional support for services that would be advertised by the corresponding APs For instance in Fig 1 a subset of APs marked with a circle offers a service to collect data coming from energy plug  a connected power plug monitoring the energy consumption These APs advertise in the beacons their support for this service Then this announce allows energy plugs to differentiate the APs and detect the ones supporting this service and which will enable them to send the monitored data from the rest Once a plug is paired with one AP it transmits its data to the AP that will forward them via tunneling mechanism to the correct destination represented by the server in the top-right of Fig 1 To achieve this goal an AP has to advertise the services it supports and forward M2M trafìc in addition to its main use  providing Internet to standard users These mechanisms are simple to set up as shown in Section III-C In addition it enables to adapt the periodicity of service advertisement depending on the importance given to the service B Announcing support for M2M services Service advertisement mechanism is required in order to enable the M2M devices to automatically detect which services are available on a network when the network is discovered Additionally the service availabilities must be discoverable without having to associate to the network Our proposal ensures these two requirements while avoiding to exchange several messages with the AP and being able to discard networks that do not support the desired service In order to do so we propose a solution based on existing messages that are already present in the legacy networks During the discovery phase  devices receive periodic messages beacons from APs These messages contains different information regarding the Wi-Fi network for the devices to connect to it Our proposal consists in adding to the VendorSpeciìc eld of the beacon or probe-response frame an option tag describing the services supported by the network M2M nodes can use this information to determine which WiFi networks are worth connecting to Contrary to traditional Wi-Fi networks active probing may be too expensive energywise for a battery-operated M2M device looking for a speciìc service For that reason in this paper we will limit our study to passive probing It is important however to stress that the active probing mechanism is in complete accordance with our architecture Each service is represented with an unique identiìer ID The tag included in the beacon will thus contain as much IDs as supported services However this tag should also contain some speciìc information additionally to the available services In fact we believe it can be essential to have information on the providers deploying the service e.g the WM-SP So tags should as well contain a provider ID WM-SP ID Thus provider-speciìc nodes can ignore all other providers except the one they belong to This tag ensures that devices discover the available services supported by each Wi-Fi networks at the same time they discover them There is no additional message exchange needed for this discovery phase and the tag should be small enough to not overload beacons Devices can ignore APs not supporting the service they require Finally devices that do not base their network selection on the service availability can simply ignore this option e.g this mechanism is entirely backward compatible Depending on the delay tolerance of the service the tag can be set in each beacon or every n beacons For instance critical services such as an health monitoring will be advertised in all beacons of a given AP This beacon hop increases the probability for critical services to be discovered Moreover this advertisement period enables to have more services advertised while bypassing the tag size issue  since there will be a shifting in the advertised services With this solution adding a new service advertisement in the beacon is simple as it only requires to add the new service ID into the advertised services C Support for M2M trafìc retrieval 1 At the Access Point level In this architecture AP has to have a different behavior In fact M2M trafìc has to be routed speciìcally as shown in Fig 2 APs will have to manage data ows coming from M2M communications in addition to its main activity i.e providing Internet access AP will also have to manage the tag announced in its beacon messages AP will have a conìguration mechanism listing all the services it has to announce and their parameters such as the advertisement periodicity the service ID and the level of authentication needed When the AP receives M2M trafìc it has to transfer it to the corresponding destination One of the possibilities is to construct Virtual Private Networks VPN upon request In addition if authentication is needed between the AP and M2M nodes APs will have to manage service authentication keys There are a lot of possibilities described in the literature such as based on pre-shared keys distributed or centralized or based on a Public Key Infrastructure PKI In any case the speciìc mechanism can be known in advance conìgured for each service We consider this question albeit essential out of scope for our study and we assume the nodes are authenticated via an appropriate mechanism such as based on IEEE 802.1X 2 At the node level Device will have a different behavior since they need to take into account this service announcement In fact devices will have to check for the presence of a service tag in the beacons Devices should therefore be able to understand this tag and compare the expected service ID to the ones advertised in beacons Once a matching WM-SP is found the device has to authenticate to the AP and send the corresponding data using the IP address allocated by the 3 


4 Fig 2 Speciìc routing rules inside APs AP or the one assigned prior to its deployment Indeed M2M nodes can be deployed with a pre-assigned IP address This pre-assignment will avoid having to retrieve the IP address from the AP and gain time usually used to do so for retrieving M2M data IV F EASIBILITY STUDY The WM-SP architecture described in Section III relies on current standard technologies and provides new communication paradigm for M2M devices In order to demonstrate that the principle is indeed valid we performed a feasibility study in a speciìc use case We considered the case of a monitoring service which could be monitoring the activity and position of a pet or monitoring someoneês health both examples having a different level of criticality Thus a device is monitoring some physical characteristic and sending the measurements whenever it is under a Wi-Fi coverage that support its monitoring service The device is mobile moving inside an area alternating between with and without Wi-Fi coverage Even when it is under Wi-Fi coverage it may not be able to send its data as the corresponding AP may not support the service it is looking for or the devices may be sleeping when it receives the beacon The goal here is to study the inîuence of the advertisement frequency on the time to discover the supported services and the inîuence of the Wi-Fi density on the performance A Mathematical modeling of a M2M monitoring service The aforementioned service can be represented by a three states Markov chain  State 0 the device is not under Wi-Fi coverage  State 1 the device is under Wi-Fi coverage but has not received a beacon with the expected tag  State 2 the device is under Wi-Fi coverage and has received a beacon with the expected tag We consider that if the device is under Wi-Fi coverage it leaves the corresponding state after a delay following an exponential law with rate   Transitioning from non-covered to covered region is done with rate   In order to make the problem mathematically tractable we consider that beacons are sent following a Poisson law with a rate   If we denote with p the probability that the device is sleeping this Markov chain can be illustrated as shown in Fig 3 As the studied scenario is a continuous-time Markov chain with xed number of states the generator matrix Q  can be Fig 3 Markov Chain model for a monitoring service  1 0 2   p   obtained in closed form Q     0     p p 000  1 Let  t  i  represent the probabilities to be in the state i while P t represent the transition state matrix If we note  t   t 0  t 1  t 2 then  t  0  P t  0  e Q  t 2 As mentioned previously we are interested in knowing the time necessary to receive an appropriate tag i.e to arrive in state 2 After computation  t 2 can be reduced to the following expression   t 2  1  K 1 e  At 2  K 2 e  Bt 2 3 with K 1  1 2   2  p       2 2     R K 2  1 2       2  p      2     R A    p    R B    p    R R    2 2  2 p  p  2  2 p   2 Values for  and  have to be determined in order to complete this model and study their inîuence on the delay needed to discover the services B Determining values for this modeling In order to instantiate the aforementioned Markov chain we use real world data that characterize Wi-Fi deployment Wi2Me is an Android-based research application that has been developed to build Wi-Fi APs map and automate Wi-Fi connection This tool also allows evaluating the availability and performance of CNs 1 Methodology Wi2Me application uses active probing to discover Wi-Fi networks and then connects to the AP with the highest signal level It continues scanning the different channels and if it nds a network with a better signal level will then attempt to connect to it Then aside from its original aim Wi2Me enables to determine the Wi-Fi network density since it stores results of all the scans performed while the application is running Guidec et al used W i2Me in a eld trial for testing a disruption-tolerant application in a rural area Wi2Me has also been extensively used in the city of Rennes France where volunteers have walked around the city in order to 4

delay needed to receive the expected tag is lower in denser area i.e with a greater   However the case 1 in rural area presents better results cf dashed line in Fig 5 than cases 2 and 3 city center for a success rate lower than 0  9  But for success rate higher than 0  9  results of case 1 are deteriorating drastically This should be taken into consideration since the time without Wi-Fi coverage in the rural area is too high to enable a constant high probability of successfully receive a beacon Thus depending on the desired success rate study on the available Wi-Fi density has to be performed before deploying a service 3 Probability to successfully send data In this monitoring scenario being able to receive the appropriate tag is not the most important In fact the goal for the device is to successfully send the collected data With the Markov chain depicted in Fig 3 the probability to send data before leaving the current Wi-Fi area is the following P e     4 where  is the time needed to send the data For an IEEE 802.11b Wi-Fi network the typical throughput is around 6 Mbit/s  We can re-use values measured during the trial performed in to illustrate the data transmission part The data produced by a wireless Electrocardiogram ECG shimmer sensor is around 16 kB every 20 sec  For this example  is then equal to 21  33 ms  Such sensors need 21  33 ms to send their data every 20 sec In the case 2 the probability for this sensor to send its data before leaving the Wi-Fi coverage is P e  0  8532  10  3 0  99  Therefore in 99 of the time and for this density this speciìc device will always successfully send its data before leaving the current coverage And since it only needs 21  33 ms to transfer the data the sensor will still be able to do it even with a service advertisement period from 100 ms to up to 2 seconds Thus it is possible to use such a mechanism to collect M2M trafìcs via existing Wi-Fi networks However the advertisement period of each services depend on the density of APs offering these services and on the size of data to send V C ONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES In this paper we presented a lightweight service announcement architecture and studied its properties in the context of Wi-Fi networks Speciìcally we analyzed the possibility of reusing existing Wi-Fi networks for M2M communications WiFi networks are a good alternative to cellular network and will inevitably be impacted by the M2M trafìc We demonstrated that depending on the importance given to a service the density of Wi-Fi networks is often sufìcient to enable the retrieval of M2M data The results are based on mathematical model of the proposed architecture which allow for a close-form solution The model has been parametrized with real-world data collected in several war-driving campaigns We plan to extend our study in several directions The impact of a large number of M2M nodes within a speciìc coverage of Wi-Fi networks is the next step In fact contrary to cellular networks the high amount of APs enable to balance the nodes among them The effectiveness of announcing available services through beacons should also be studied through simulation of the deployment of a critical service such as an health monitoring service These simulations will enable to compare this solution and its performance with others R EFERENCES  A Balasubramanian R Mahajan A

estimated using the frequency with which features selected from the whole dataset were also selected when using bootstrapped versions of the data The authors found that their proposed random forestbased approach can lead to performance comparable with the existing lter-based ranking and embedded techniques although it does not always produce the best results Of the ten real-world datasets four showed their best performance with lter-based feature selection three were best with one of the previously-described embedded techniques one was best with plain random forest e.g without building multiple random forest models and two were best with the proposed embedded ensemble random forest approach However the proposed approach did consistently produce small feature subsets while the other embedded approaches each left over 1,000 features for four of the ten datasets In terms of stability the proposed approach gave much less stable gene subsets than the previouslydescribed embedded techniques although this apparent stability may have arisen from the larger feature subset sizes of those techniques Overall the authors felt the smaller feature subset size and similar performance justiìed their proposed ensemble approach Our main critique of this paper would be that stability is analyzed in a very na  ve fashion and that only embedded techniques are considered not lter-based feature subset selection or wrapper-based techniques Also although the proposed approach shows promise the random variable subset step inherent in the construction of a random forest model poses the risk of decreasing stability and increasing the chances that an important feature from the original dataset is not considered at all V F UTURE W ORK Based on the lack of research which has examined subset evaluation-based feature selection either lter-based or wrapperbased in the context of bioinformatics more work is needed in this area For example although more works are beginning to consider the problem of choosing an appropriate stability metric there is no consensus as to which are most appropriate In addition no paper considers both lter-based feature subset evaluation and wrapperbased subset selection in the same work especially in the context of biologically-relevant datasets e.g  2,000 features The large scale of data does pose real challenges and thus a major research target should be approaches which can mitigate these challenges while still bringing the full power of subset evaluation to Big Data bioinformatics datasets One potential avenue for future research is hybrid feature selection which couples a lter-based feature ranker with a subset-based feature selection technique The ranker can reduce the number of features down to a more manageable level while the subset-based technique will be able to eliminate redundant features and nd features that are truly able to improve performance A related concept is performing subset-based selection on a large but not intractable dataset and then comparing these results with a ranker performed on the same dataset This will help demonstrate how these two techniques compare and in particular how many features must be selected from the ranker before all of the important features as deìned using the subset-based results are included Thus this could lead the way for a more data-driven hybrid approach which optimizes the number of features chosen in the rst stage in order to select the important features without spending too much extra time during the second subset-based phase Finally future work may consider other ensemble and resampling techniques to reduce the number of features to a manageable level before performing subset evaluation in order to nd a near-optimal subset without searching the entire feature space All of these have the potential to open new avenues for identifying the most important genes for bioinformatics problems even when starting with thousands or tens of thousands of genes More generally future work on the topic of subset selection stability across all domains will include an empirical study using various feature selection techniques including lter-based subset evaluation and wrapper-based subset selection over several datasets from different application domains social media software quality prediction or biomedical datasets Initially we will focus on social media and software quality prediction models because these datasets have lower number of features in general Eventually we will perform an empirical study of subset-based feature selection techniques on biomedical datasets with high-dimensionality using a cluster of computers using HPCC High Performance Computing Cluster that is a massive parallel-processing computing platform to solve Big Data problems VI C ONCLUSIONS With the proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in recent years feature selection has received attention of researchers and data-mining practitioners due to its capability to improve both performance and computational efìciencies A feature subset selected by a feature selection technique is evaluated for relevance toward a task such as classiìcation or identiìcation of the top relevant features corresponding to a phenomenon of interest One important characteristics of a feature selection technique is stability which refers to insensitivity robustness of the selected features to minor changes in the training dataset In this survey paper our focus is on the problem of stability its importance and various stability measures used to evaluate subsets of selected features These subsets of features may be generated using lter-based wrapper-based or embedded techniques although we particularly focus on metrics which can be used for subset evaluationbased approaches In order to measure the stability of a feature selection technique a similarity measure is needed to assess the overlap of a pair of feature subsets The similarity measure computes the stability of a feature subset selection technique as the average similarity over all pairs of feature subsets We discussed various similarity measures in this survey paper such as the Jaccard index the Hamming distance the Consistency index Spearmanês rank correlation coefìcient and Shannon entropy Throughout this study we have discussed current research in stability analysis of feature subset selection techniques within the domain of bioinformatics and have identiìed the shortcomings of these works to explore possible opportunities for future work R EFERENCES  S Alelyani Z Zhao and H Liu

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
