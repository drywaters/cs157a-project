AN OPERATIONAL SEMANTICS FOR RTPA Cyprian F. Ngolah and Yingxu Wang Theoretical and Empirical Software Engineering Research Center Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Calgary 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, Canada T2N 1N4 Email: {ncfoinjo, yingxu}@ucalgary.ca Abstract A formal specification methodology that describes the behaviors of a real-time system must have a means to verify the specification before software is implemented from it Developing a verifier for a formal specification language demands an operational semantics for the language. If the syntactic constructs of the language involve variables, its operational semantics is more difficult to define since the environment must also show th e association of variables and 
the values to which they are assigned This paper presents the operational semantics of Real-Time Process Algebra \(RTPA\. RTPA describes a software systemís behavior using a combination of meta-processes and process relations. Based on the meta-processes and process relations the operational semantics of RTPA is presented, which shows how syntactic constructs can be reduced to values using inference rules. The operational semantics for RTPA will serve as a basis for the verifier and checker for RTPA specifications Keywords Real-time process algebra, operational semantics, reduction machine software engineering, real-time systems 
1 Introduction A methodology used for the design and specification of complex software systems such as real-time systems requires a basis for the verification of the specification u c h  systems, safety and reliability are of prime importance and it is necessary to guarantee that the developed system will provide the required functionality. A language used in the specification and design of real-time systems requires an operational semantics that describes how any particular program in the language is interpreted as sequences of computational logics 
Based on the operational semantics, a verifier or proof system can be developed, which can be used to verify specifications for semantic correctness. However, an operational semantics for a language in which its syntactic constructs involve variables is not easy to define since such a definition must include the concept of an environment that shows the association of variables and the values to which they are assigne One way to define an operational semantics for a language is to provide a state transition system for the language, which 
allows a formal analysis of the language, permitting the study of relations between programs alter n ati v e  w a y i s to  describe the operations of the language on a hypothetical machine whose operations are precisely define o m m o n  hypothetical machines include SECD \(Stack, Environment Control, Dump\L \(Vienna Definition Language\uring Machine, and a Reduction machine A reduction machine is an abstract machine that defines inference rules for repetitively simplifying language constructs until a result is obtained. It thus simulates the behaviors of an actual computer and is easily understood by the user. A 
reduction machine used to define the operational semantics of a specification language has three components: specification control and store. An operational semantics describes how the control of the machine reduces a given specification to values of variables and how the memory is changed during the execution of the specification. For languages with expressions involving variables, two semantic functions that map identifiers to memory locations and memory locations to values are defined as shown in \(1\where 
Env denotes an environment and S the store Env Identifier location S location value 1 Given a particular expression in which variables are involved, the composite function S\(Env\(Identifier is used to obtain the corresponding value for that expression when it is executed by the machine In this paper, the operational semantics of RTPA is defined using a reduction machine which defines inference rules for 
repetitively simplifying RTPA specifications until a result is obtained. RTPA is a formal specification language used for describing the behaviors of real-time software systems [5Section 2 briefly describes the syntax for RTPA. Section 3 describes the operational semantics of RTPA using a reduction machine while Section 4 gives the conclusions and future work 0-7803-8886-0/05/$20.00 ©2005 IEEE CCECE/CCGEI, Saskatoon, May 2005 1823 


2 The Abstract Syntax of RTPA RTPA has 16 meta-processes and 16 process relations Meta-processes in RTPA are the building blocks for more complicated processes while process relations are combinatory rules used to combine meta-pro cesses to form more complex processes. The syntax and deductive semantics  RTP A  have been defined using the EBNF grammar [8,9   Fig. 1 shows an RTPA syntax for the meta-processes and process relations. The syntax shows how each of the constructs is represented in an RTPA specification. The informal description of some of the meta-processes and process relations is given in Section 3 alongside their operational semantics Meta-Process Process Relation  Name Syntax Name Syntax System  SysID S  Sequence P  Q A ssignment y Type x Type Branch exp BL  T   P   Q where ë~í means ëexp BL  F A ddressing  Ptr P x Type Switch exp Type 0  P 0 1  P 1  n-1  P n-1 else  where exp Type  N  B  S  Input  Port\(ptr P  Type  x Type For-do   R n i 1  P\(i Output x Type  Port\(ptr P  Type Repeat   R T expBL 1   P Read Mem\(ptr P  Type x Type While-do F exp rBL T R  P Write x Type Mem\(ptr P  Type Function call P F Timing   a hh:mm:ss:ms  t hh:mm:ss:ms b yy:MM:dd  t yy:MM:dd   c  t yy:MM:dd:hh:mm:ss:ms  t yy:MM:dd:hh:mm:ss:ms Recursion P P Duration t n N t n N   n N Parallel P || Q Memory allocation AllocateObject \(ObjectID S  NofElements N  ElementType RT  Concurrence P Q Memory release ReleaseObject \(ObjectID S  Interleave P  ||| Q Increase  n Type  Pipeline P ª Q  Decrease  n Type  Time-driven dispatch t i hh:mm:ss:ms P i  i  1..n Exception detecting e S  Event-driven dispatch e i S P i i  1..n Skip  Interrupt P e S Q Stop Jump  P Q Fig. 1. The RTPA Notation System RTPA is a specification language in which variables are involved. For example, the assignment process \(y := x\ when executed causes the variable y to be replaced by the value of x Consequently, the definition of an operational semantics for RTPA must include the concept of an environment that shows the association of variables and the values to which they are assigned. This is necessary so as to avoid side-effects that usually occur due to changes in the environment 3 Operational Semantics for RTPA Formally, an operational semantics for a language is a mathematical definition of its computation relation e v where e is a program in the language and e v is a binary relation between expressions of the language e and values of the language v In this definition e and v are meta-variables denoting an arbitrary expression and value respectively.  Our intention is to show the necessary steps that an RTPA specification takes to transit from e to v The operational semantics for RTPA are defined by describing the operational semantics of both meta-processes and process relations  3.1. Notational Conventions To define the operational semantics of RTPA, we adopt the following notational conventions a E|Env Eí|Enví>: Expression E is evaluated in an environment Env to value Eí in a new environment Enví.  In each case, Enví will be derived based on the composition of Env. If the expression E contains variables, the value of Eí is derived using equation Eí = S\(Env\(E from mapping relation shown in rule \(1 b premise conclusion  condition This represents an inference rule in which a conclusion is drawn whenever premise is true. Sometimes there is a condition attached to premise c x/y dicate s th a t v a l u e of variable x replaces the value of variable y in the store \(memory d Type x eturns the meta-type of variable x  e RT\(x\eturns the meta-type of variable x at run-time f P   t Pí: P executes to Pí after t units of time 3.2 Operational Semantics of RTPA Meta Processes Using the reduction machine defined in Section 1 and the notational conventions, the operational semantics for metaprocesses of RTPA are given. In this paper, we present the operational semantics of three meta-processes ñ assignment timing and duration processes. The operational semantics of the rest of 13 meta-processes are similarly defined i\he Assignment Process y RT x RT RTPA allows a variable in a different process to be assigned to a variable in another process. Consequently, the environments for the variables may be different. However, their types must be the same at run-time for the process to be executed.  For the assignment process, the resulting environment when x is assigned to y is the union of the environments of x and y. The operational semantics for the assignment statement is shown in 2 1824 


 yx yx RT\(y\ =  RT\(x y|Env x | Env  x/y   Env   E n v   2 ii Timing Informally, the timing process assigns system time to a given time variable. Therefore, we treat the timing process in a similar way to the assignment process except that system time is read from system clock and therefore does not have an environment. The three inference rules shown in 3a, 3b and 3c show the RTPA operational semantics when the time variable is a short time, date and long time variable respectively a Variable t is a short time variable TM = hh:mm:ss:ms  tt RT\(@t\=TM t:STime|Env t:STime>  <[ßt/@t  E n v  3a b Variable t is a date variable Date = yy:MM:dd  tt RT\(@t\=Date t:Date|Env t:Date> <[ßt/@t E nv  3b c Variable t is a long time variable LTime = yyyy:hh:mm:ss:ms  tt RT\(@t\ = LTime t:LTime|Env t:LTime t E n v  3c iii Duration t n N t n N   n N We treat duration in the context of time delay. Informally, the duration process, delays an executing process for an amount of time equal to  n Thus if P is an executing process, then the expression,  ìP t n N t n N   n N  means ìexecute P followed by a time delay of  n time unitsî. Simply put, P executes to a state Pí and does nothing while time  n elapses In this case, the environment of P is not affected by t. An operational semantics for the duration process is given in \(4  pp n ptp P | Env  P ' | Env  P|Env tN := ßtN n\|Env  P P '|Env      4 3 2 Operational Semantics of RTPA process relations We present the operational semantics of five RTPA process relations: sequence, while-do, Branch, parallel and eventdriven dispatch i Sequence P  Q Informally, P  Q means ìexecute P followed by Qî. The environments of P and Q may be different. Consequently, the operational semantics must take this into consideration. This is represented as shown in \(5  pp pq qp P | Env  P ' | Env  P|Env  Q|Env  P Q|Env Env    5 ii While - do  T exprBL=T R P Using the while-do process relation, the Boolean expression expr is repeatedly tested. If it is false, the loop terminates. This is shown in rule 6a  T exprB L=T exprBL|Env false|Env P\|Env Env R 6a If expr evaluates to true, then P evaluates to Pí followed by another iteration. This is shown in rule \(6b  pp TT pp exprBL =T exprBL=T exprBL|Env> <true|Env P|Env P '|Env   R P\|Env  P R P\|Env   6b iii Branch expr BL  T   P  Q If the Boolean expression expr  evaluates to true, then process P is executed, otherwise process Q is executed. It should be noted that when P is executed, the environment of Q does not change and has no effect on the environment of P. Rule 7a and 7b show respectively the situation when expr is true and false respectively  pp pqp exprBL|Env true|Env P|Env  P '|Env  exprBL=T P|Env  Q|Env   P '|Env    7a  qq pqq exprBL | Env false|Env Q|Env Q '|Env  exprBL=T P | Env  Q | Env  Q ' | Env   7b iv Parallel: P || Q \(Multi-processor single clock  For the parallel process, there can be two possible scenarios 1825 


a P is executing and Q is not executing for a given period of time \(and vice versa i.e. no synchronization. Rule 8\(a\(i and 8\(aii\how inference rules when P and Q are executing  respectively  pp pq pq P|Env P '|Env  P|Env Q|Env  P '  || <Q|Env  Env   8a  qq pq pq Q|Env  Q '|Env  P|Env Q|Env  P|<Env Env Q  8b b P and Q perform a common timed event If P and Q are executing on a common time action, then the operational semantics is as shown in rule 8b  pp qq pq pq P|Env P '|Env  Q|Env  Q '|Env  P|Env Q|Env  P '||Q '|Env   Env  8c v Event Driven Dispatch: @e i S P i i   1..n For event-driven dispatch, a given event causes a process to be dispatched. If no event occurs then no process is dispatched Thus we can rewrite event-driven dispatch in RTPA as event S e i S  P i   where event S is an event variable \(a string\. With the new definition, we can give the operational semantics as shown in rules 9a and 9b ie e ie ip ie p event= e Env  true | Env  e Env  P Env  P' | Env Env   9a ie e ie ie e event=e Env  false | Env    e E nv  P E nv   E nv  9b Rule 9a is executed when a given event has occurred and 9b is executed when no event has occurred 4. Conclusions An operational semantics for a specification language defines how a valid specification in the language is interpreted as a sequence of computations. It thus lays groundwork for verification of formal specifications, particularly for real-time systems where specifications are expected to be precise and unambiguous. However, it is difficult to define an operational semantics for languages which contain variables since any execution of a program also results in changes in the environment and memory locations to which assigned values are stored. This paper defines the operational semantics of Real-Time Process Algebra \(RTPA\wo relationships that map identifiers to memory locations and memory locations to values are defined. Based on these relationships, an operational semantics for RTPA is presented for the 16 meta-processes and 16 process relations using a reduction machine, which defines inference rules for repeatedly simplifying language constructs until a result is obtained. The operational semantics for RTPA lays groundwork for the development of a verifier for the RTPA specification language. Further work still remains to be done to provide operational semantics for some complicated RTPA process relations such as interrupt dispatch, time-driven dispatch, and concurrency and to develop a verifier for RTPA Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada \(NSERC\ for its support to this work.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
