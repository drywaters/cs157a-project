PipeFlow Engine Pipeline Scheduling with Distributed Work”ow Made Simple 
Distributed computing system is considered as a fundamental architecture to extend resources such as computation speed storage capacity and network bandwidth which are limited for a single processor Emerging big data processing techniques like Hadoop take advantages of distributed servers to accomplish scalable parallel computations Large 
Abstract 
scale processing jobs can run on different servers or even different clusters interdependently and be combined together as a work”ow to provide meaningful outputs In this paper we analyze the common demands of big-data processing and distributed big-data work”ow processing According to that we design PipeFlow Engine that has the matching features to meet each of these demands It orchestrates all involved jobs and schedules them in a batched pipeline mode We also present two online ranking algorithms that make use of the PipeFlow sharing the experience and best practice of using PipeFlow I I

Keywords 
NTRODUCTION Scalable systems give more focus on distributed architecture as both CPU clock speed storage and network I/O bandwidth for a single machine form a bottleneck when dealing with large scale of data Parallel tasks are either mapped or sharded to different server nodes taking advantages of distributed resources Google cluster combines more than 15,000 commodity-class PCs to run their web search engine Some of the distrib uted processing and storage softwares Google has built have already become successful open-stack cloud frameworks such as Hadoop MapReduce GFS HBase These tools split a single job or set of data into several parts that are mapped to different servers For jobs that are scheduled as a whole without sharding they are also 
assigned to different nodes for performance considerations To obtain a desired result it usually requires fetching and processing a large set of data and run several interdependent jobs Google has 1 PB of new data every 3 days not to mention the total data amounts The data needs to be fetched from thousands and hundreds of sites parsed to structured data sets and indexed for search All these jobs are bonded together to make the outputs searchable and run in a distributed way A work”ow engine is a tool to monitor and coordinate the job executions Without an automatic tool to handle the complicated orchestration of correlated jobs operators need to check whether it is the right time to launch 
a job by manually monitoring the progress of the work”ow In addition the limitation appears when users need to de“ne work”ows using the metrics operators cannot easily observe such as the performance of the jobs in a work”ow In the distributed system environment a controller is responsible for scheduling jobs in the cluster according to each jobs requirement and system status Jobs are submitted to the controller requesting for arbitration The controller is viewed as a master in our system and the result of arbitration is a speci“c slave that is allocated to the submitted job The large volumes of data and tasks are usually processed within several rounds In each round a small part of them is fetched and processed to produce a small set of results 
The reasons that the whole data set is divided into several pieces are threefold 1 the cost of one-round failure will be amortized to be low 2 the output of each round can immediately be obtained as the input of another job therefore jobs can be formed a pipeline and run in parallel 3 users usually desire interactive data processes as they can check the progress and validity of the intermediate outputs PipeFlow Engine is designed to meet these requirements It is a distributed work”ow engine that consists of both the master node and slave nodes The master runs as an arbitrator and scheduler while slave nodes respond it to handle each job PipeFlow is extensible and exible Users 
can add slave nodes either before the engine starts or at run-time PipeFlow Engine can process each job in three different modes mode mode and mode mode is the simple processing way that takes the whole data set as the input set Users can use mode if they need to divide the data set into several and run one of them in each round mode takes all the segments 
run run-one run-all Run run-one segments Run-all 
currently available and gathers them together as the whole input data set Users can specify the running mode of each job in a work”ow To use PipeFlow users need to de“ne a work”ow in a con“guration le containing the information of each job in the work”ow such as how to execute the job the input/output paths the related jobs it depends on Users also need to specify the orchestration of the jobs in another le using the provided APIs and then submit work”ows as the same as using a single-node server work”ow engine which makes the interface transparent to users

PipeFlow Engine provides a rich set of APIs that users can use to achieve complicated work”ow orchestration For example DAG-styled can be de“ned using job-dependency API Jobs can run periodically with or without being checked whether the previous rounds of them are nished or not A job can be speci“ed to run on a certain machine or dynamically assigned to the very server with the most idle resources Another goal of our design is to tackle performance issues PipeFlow engine monitors the system status as well as the performance of each job Users can de“ne their work”ow scheduling policy according to these performance metrics and let the work”ow engine make scheduling decisions at run-time By using the performance information users can make better use of the cluster and obtain more desirable results We consider the scenarios of master failures slave failures as well as client failures for fault tolerance By designing schemes to handle these scenarios we make PipeFlow recoverable and able to continue processing from the checkpoint set before the work”ow user de“nes fails PipeFlow Engine supports both user-de“ned jobs and Hadoop MapReduce jobs It can allow I/O operations of both local lesystems and HDFS Users can de“ne MapReduce jobs in a work”ow and mix them with ordinary jobs The APIs to different sorts of jobs are identical The goal of PipeFlow Engine is to make the de“nition of distributed work”ow with pipeline scheduling simple It is extensible and exible that users can easily implement their own add-ons such as various job triggers We design two online ranking algorithms to demonstrate why PipeFlow Engine is useful for building batched scheduling work”ow II R ELATED W ORK Work”ow management systems are used in many elds aiming at integrating jobs with temporal relations or other relations of cause and effect There are different categories of work”ow systems according to the elds they are designed for such as business process work”ow and scienti“c work”ow systems Many previous work focused on the composition of work”ow tasks by constructing a set of composition models including Map Reduce Tree  Amazon Simple W ork”o w Service Amazon SWF 5 is a work”ow service coordinating tasks to build scalable resilient applications in public cloud Google developed MapReduce system to process big data applications on lar ge clusters MapReduce divides a job into bunch of tasks which are mapped and processed on distributed servers The intermediate outputs are collected by Reducer tasks which gather the records with the same keys Hadoop is a popular open-source version of MapReduce and GFS used in the industry to process large-scale data To make MapReduce programming simple Hive 10 and Pig  12 are b uilt on top of Hadoop as script languages which are compiled and translated into work”ows consisting of MapReduce jobs There are several work”ow systems integrated with Hadoop assembling several jobs as a whole work”ow Users can specify relations between jobs using either DAG or scripting languages Oozie is a work”ow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs Job can be triggered by timer or data availability using Oozie It provides scalability security multi-tenancy and operability  Azkaban 15 used internally at Link edIn achie v es the similar functions However traditional work”ows are unsophisticated to handle jobs running on a cluster while peripheral work”ow systems of MapReduce are built with singular purpose These systems do not seek to provide a pipeline model to process big data applications leaving the pipelined scheduling to users themselves In addition jobs can only be timer or data triggered in spite that the effects of system and job performance are signi“cant to work”ow scheduling Moreover when a work”ow fails in the middle of the execution users are hard to restart it from a safe point which causes inconsistency issues and wastes resources III W ORKFLOW P ROGRAMMING M ODEL PipeFlow Engine requires users to register jobs before calling them in the work”ow de“nitions Users then de“ne the processing logics using PipeFlow script APIs This section describes several steps required to de“ne a work”ow Users need to notice the work”ow engine the information of all the jobs before they are called in the work”ow de“nition Job registration and work”ow de“nition are two separate steps In doing so the job information can be reused by more than one work”ows It also bene“ts the work”ow consistency since no duplicate jobs will be registered twice or more times by different work”ows Once users register a job its information will be available to all the work”ows de“ned afterward As for PipeFlow Engine jobs are registered through sending a YAML con“guration le to the master  A YMAL con“guration le may consists of several jobs each of which has the following elds represented by YAML key-value map  The Name eld can be quoted to call the registered jobs in work”ow de“nitions The Host eld is where the job handler is positioned and should be invoked The master will allocate the right server to the job according to it The Host can be either user-de“ned or dynamic assigned For example if the user wants to schedule the job to the most under loaded server node when it is invoked he can put CPU to the Host eld to specify this job favors fast CPU processing

Even though big data tools like Hadoop is good at processing large scale of data by dividing large job into many small tasks which are processed in a distributed way the data scale at big companies like Google is still gigantic comparative to its cluster size Depending on the job type the incomplete result may lead to inconsistent states or useless outputs if a job fails in the middle of the execution For jobs that run long time it is unacceptable and wastes a lot of computing resources Therefore developers tend to run their jobs round by round For each round only relatively small amounts of data inputs are injected and processed In case a small job comes to a failure it can be restarted without sacri“cing a lot of time and efforts The bene“t that this round-by-round way also brings about is that it enables pipeline processing Whenever a round of sub-job is completed its outputs can be used immediately as the inputs to other jobs An additional advantage enabled by the round-by-round processing is that a job can be run interactively and reports periodically the partial outputs of processed data In other word it makes intermediate data visible to users which can be used to implement feedback systems and help run-time debugging Streaming like Storm is an alternati v e method of pipeline and is highly interactive However it cannot take advantages of batch processing so that it wastes resources such as I/O bandwidths The core feature of big data analytic tools is to use batching mechanism PipeFlow engine automates the round-by-round execution and pipeline in a work”ow In the job registration le users can specify if the input is fetched and processed in a pipeline mode and if the result is output in a separate segment for pipelined execution of other jobs or just appended to the existed outputs In pipeline mode inputs or outputs are fetched processed or generated in the form of segments which are subdirectories of the main input or output directory For example an input of a job may consist of  so does an output A job can read and process just one segment in a round or process all currently existed segments ready to read Users can use the following syntax to de“ne the processing modes InputName is the input name used by work”ow de“nitions InputFS is the source le system where the job can read input data Currently PipeFlow engine supports both local le system and HDFS InputPath is the input directory path It can be either absolute or relative to the PipeFlow home path The option that follows is the speci“cation of process modes If the option is empty the job is in the mode where the data is not in the form of segments If a single equal sign is speci“ed in the option the job runs in the mode where the input data is in the form of segments a single one of which is read and processed in each round Similarly a single equal sign in the outputs means the output data is stored in a newly generated segment If for inputs two equal signs are speci“ed the job will run in the mode where all segments currently existed and ready to read will be processed in a single round For outputs it is not allowed to have two equal signs de“ned Note that each one of the inputs or outputs is independent so different inputs for a job can have different modes speci“ed PipeFlow Engine provides rich and exible APIs for users to de“ne their work”ows Users can de“nes work”ows using script language like Python There are three categories of APIs provided by PipeFlow Engine APIs for executing jobs i.e job trigger APIs for obtaining data information for datatriggered jobs and APIs for acquiring the performance of jobs and cluster status Job execution APIs are listed in Table I Every operations Table I J OB E XECUTION API S API Description exec job Execute  If it is set to be which is the default PipeFlow will rstly check whether the job is already in running status e.g the previous round is not nished If the job is in running status the engine will skip the execution operation The can depend on run-time status by passing a  Users can de“ne a condition using either function or common function de“nition The condition can be viewed as a trigger to launch a job Triggers include data availability performance driven factors or any other userde“ned boolean functions Timer-triggered execution has already been implemented as APIs Users can specify when to start a job and can also run a job at intervals Users can use API to implement DAG execution plans It is convenient to use it to de“ne a work”ow with job dependency PipeFlow Engine provides suf“cient data lookup APIs as data availability triggers Every data lookup API is

provided with two types lookup in the local le system and lookup in the distributed le system e.g  The same set of lookup APIs is also de“ned for outputs The latter two ops are de“ned for pipelined jobs They count the number or the size of un“nished or buffered segments for a job The un“nished segments include the running job scheduled by the master while the buffered segments result excludes the currently running job and only count the pending jobs waiting to be scheduled Another useful set of APIs aims at monitoring job and system performance e.g  For the job statistics we currently monitor three metrics job duration throughput and job input arrival rate These three metrics are all calculated as moving average using EWMA method Users can de“ne work”ows using these monitored metrics e.g users can run a job more frequently whenever the throughput of its dependent job is high We will show a case study in the following section to demonstrate how useful it is to schedule jobs according to their performance The server metrics include CPU speed memory and disk usages Users can use API to nd the best sever node a job can be executed on according to the speci“ed criteria such as CPU memory and disk usage Work”ow de“nition using PipeFlow Engine is as simple as writing scripts to run jobs in the local machine The only thing users need to do is to create a PipeFlow proxy and invoke PipeFlow APIs to orchestrate jobs registered at PipeFlow master The following template is a simple example of work”ow de“nition This work”ow de“nes two jobs A and B It rstly execute under the condition user de“ned in the class can be launched after is completed If has not nished within 10 mins quits waiting unilaterally Note that although we use sequential script to de“ne a PipeFlow instance the execution of the work”ow is concurrent PipeFlow Engine does not guarantee all-or-nothing atomic transaction of work”ows The fundamental reason is that our design aims at big data analysis which cares less about strong transaction semantics In addition redo/undo operations waste a lot of time and resources on rolling back or regenerating large amount of output data which is inappropriate in the big-data processing elds The more desirable semantic is to support restart operations from where jobs failed and continue processing from the right checkpoints Eventually it will achieve the same goal of original transaction semantic We call this weakened transaction  The following code shows an example of implementing eventual transaction The primitives PipeFlow de“nes execution blocks that enables restoration are and  The code piece de“ned between these two primitives is called a  which is stateful The PipeFlow engine keeps the running state of the work”ow If the work”ow fails in the middle of the checkblock PipeFlow can restart it from where it fails last time Note that checkblock cannot contain operation as this type of operation is stateless Users can always restart this type of job execution from any state In the above example if the work”ow failed when Job A was nished but Job B was not it would only execute Job B when recovered IV S YSTEM D ESIGN This section describes the core design of PipeFlow Engine After presenting the overview of PipeFlow design we focus on illustrating three main challenges in the design segment management failure recovery and performance measurement Figure 1 shows the overall infrastructure of the PipeFlow work”ow management system PipeFlow Engine consists of one process and many distributed processes More slave processes can be launched at run-time even after master has already started When a slave is started it registers itself to the master which then adds the slave to the worker group and heartbeats to all the slaves periodically If a slave fails or quits from the group it removes the slave from the worker group Users register jobs by sending con“guration information to the master The master receives and parses the con“guration does some transformation For example if the

or  it creates a led and sets it to  Afterwards it lls the elds with the proper resource address The master then shards the job con“guration according to the eld and sends the parsed con“gurations to the corresponding slaves in its worker group If the host of is speci“ed as  the information of is sent to  For dynamic jobs their information is sent to all slaves existed in the working group because every time the dynamic job is scheduled it may run on any of the slaves Whenever a new slave is launched after it registers to the master the master will synchronize all the job information to the slave so that the slave can catch up with other slaves In PipeFlow Engine the job con“guration information is persisted in the master node using LevelDB by serializing the job information to key-value form while slaves store the information in memory without being persisted By this way slaves are extensible and maintain consistency with no efforts Users run their work”ow de“nitions as client stubs which contact to the master node by RPC calls The master does not hand over clients requests to the corresponding slaves but only accepts job information lookups as similar as DNS After clients obtain the positions where the work”ow operations should run they invoke the corresponding slave nodes directly to execute the operations through several other RPC calls The master is also responsible for two other types of requests one is to monitor and get statistics of the cluster status PipeFlow runs on i.e the status of each slave node the other is to nd the appropriate slaves dynamic jobs should be executed on using the statistics Clients adopt asynchronous RPC calls to invoke operations on the slaves whose information the master returns Asynchronous RPC enables clients to register callback functions invoked on the reply of the completion messages without busy waiting for the execution results Slaves implement some basic primitives of work”ow operations including job execution data and performance metric lookups Slave only implements the raw operation Other extensions of such as are implemented in the client library The reason we do this is because if is implemented on the slave process it is hard for clients to stop the executions unilaterally even if it could it will cost another RPC call The slave process keeps track of the running jobs when they are scheduled in order to make each job as a singleton if ag is set to the execution operations It is like acquiring a lock for each job Only after the job is nished can another instance of the same job be launched We also implement a distributed lock to guarantee the isolation of two distributed job executions if users specify that two jobs cannot be executed concurrently The distributed lock can be run as an independent process We put it along with the master process For data lookup operations the slaves implement two sets of primitives one for local le system and one for distributed le system By wrapping HDFS APIs it supports Hadoop File System lookups and Hadoop jobs Using PipeFlow APIs as well as Dumbo which is a p ython interf ace of Hadoop users can also de“ne work”ows with Hadoop MapReduce jobs The client library wraps some operations of slave to implement more complex work”ow operations such as  Usually each of these operation contains more than one RPC calls to the slaves One of the main features of PipeFlow is to support pipeline execution by segment management The job input is split using user-assisted method Users only need to split the source input of the rst job in their de“ned work”ow Then PipeFlow takes over the control of the split segments The segment management component is implemented in both slave process and client library It consists of two-phase tags Before a slave executes a job PipeFlow nds the rst or all buffered segments or un“nished segments if concurrency of the same job is not allowed the job will read inputs from according to the input mode user sets PipeFlow tags these segments as  After the job completes PipeFlow tags them as  These tags enable PipeFlow to nd the right segments to process They are persisted in the input information The process of nding segments and tagging them should be atomic especially if ag is not set for the job so that two or more instances of the same job can be executed concurrently Even for two different jobs it is still possible to have race condition if these jobs operate the same inputs For this case distributed lock service is needed to make sure two distributed jobs with the same input directory are isolated In addition another set of tags is created to indicate whether jobs start or not When a job starts executing PipeFlow tags the job as  which is removed after

the job is nished The nish status is also kept in the slave process as to implement operation indicating the jobs that depend on it is ready to run This set of tags is also used to restart un“nished jobs if slave process failed accidentally They are persisted in the job meta information PipeFlow adopts the atomic output mechanism to handle output data When a job is running PipeFlow redirects its output data to a temporary directory After the job is nished successfully PipeFlow automatically links the temporary directory to the real destination This mechanism guarantees the integrity of output data In addition the atomicity of output segments helps PipeFlow to nd the next segment as output destination and prevent it from overlapping the positions of un“nished segments There are three types of failures in the PipeFlow system master failure slave failure and client failure Since the master only implements job information lookups it only needs to restore job information after failure without caring about job execution states LevelDB has its own failure recovery mechanism that uses logs to persist the data to be restored We design slave and client failure recovery mechanisms as follows Since slave does not record any state of job execution it references the tags PipeFlow persists to recover from failure When slave restarts from failure it checks the started but un“nished jobs and the corresponding segments through parsing from job tags It then restarts these jobs and restores them into the running group that keeps track of all the running jobs Clients keep retrying to connect to that failed slave once in a while The retry process will not block the subsequent operations in the work”ow de“nition since all the operations de“ned in the PipeFlow are concurrent logically The master will detect failed slaves through heartbeat timeout For dynamically scheduled job the master will choose another slave after the originally assigned slave fails The master will also alter the host information for this job The master notices the new slave to recover and restore the un“nished jobs and corresponding segments that failed in the middle of executions When the original slave wakes up it ignores the un“nished dynamically scheduled jobs that have tags unlike other jobs which are not dynamically scheduled If client fails instead of slave the work”ow will enter an inconsistent state where part of operations are sent to the corresponding slaves and the others are not PipeFlow tries to achieve eventual transaction semantic by implementing at-most-once semantic of job invocation Before actually invoking and executing each job de“ned in the work”ow PipeFlow logs the job in the database indicating the job has been invoked and then sends RPC call to the slave When restarting the work”ow from failures PipeFlow engine loads the log and skips the logged job to avoid duplicated execution For operations PipeFlow logs them no matter what values the conditions are so that it will not be executed again in the future As for operations PipeFlow logs them only if they have ever valued such that PipeFlow can retry executing the corresponding jobs when recovering from failures Performance metrics such as execution duration and throughput are measured for every successful jobs and calculated as moving averages We only brie”y explain the relative arrival rate PipeFlow measures This metric indicates how many segments are appended to a job between the period two rounds of the job are executed If this metric is greater than one the arrival rate is beyond the processing rate which means a lot of segments will be pending in the system PipeFlow updates this metric whenever a job is nished and whenever the timely updated metric has already been beyond the value measured since last job has been nished even though this round of the job is still running V O NLINE R ANKING A LGORITHMS U SING P IPE F LOW Online ranking is used to rank online data dynamically with input data arriving in batches in any time Unlike of”ine ranking online ranking cannot rank all the inputs in strict order since it cannot predict what data comes in the future The online ranking algorithm should strike balance between ranking performance and throughput We design two different algorithms using PipeFlow in this section to maximize the throughput while trying to achieve better ranking performance We take AdWork work”ow as an example to illustrate the online ranking algorithm AdWork is an advertisement bidding system AdWork work”ow is a process to rank the online batch arrival advertisement bids select the ads from high bids to low tag them by keywords and send them to a lter that checks the legality of the ads and archive them to the subsequent processing The archive le should try to adjust the ads with high bids to move as high as possible on the nal results In short the AdWork work”ow includes the following jobs RankSelect Tag Filter and Archive RankSelect gathers all unselected ads and sorts them to generate ads with highest bids and puts the other ads in a le which contains unselected les The selected ads are tagged by the Tag job and passed to the lter which fetches and checks the web pages of these ads according to the URLs they provide The lter parses the pages and checks their legality according to the contents Finally the legal ads go to the archive le through the Archive job

The ads arrive in batch In order to make the work”ow form a pipeline PipeFlow splits each job in segments and schedules it round by round Each batch of the ads generates a new segment RankSelect reads all the segments every time sorts and selects the ads which are collected as a segment output The Tag and Filter jobs both fetch and generate one segment in each round Archive collects all output segments of Filter and merges them to a single le online To maximum the throughput we should keep the job that is the bottleneck of this work”ow as busy as possible In this case Filter is the slowest job since it needs to crawl and parse data from Internet We need to guarantee that Filter always have pending input segments PipeFlow makes the work”ow run in pipeline so all the jobs run periodically in parallel We de“ne the AdWork work”ow as follows The interval of periodical execution is set to 0.1 sec Each job waits to start a new round till the buffered input segment number of its subsequent job becomes 0 We can prove that this algorithm guarantees whatever the bottleneck job is it is kept as busy as possible After the work”ow is executed each upstream job of the slowest job gradually saves up one buffered segment and is blocked Once the last buffered segment begins to process its upstream jobs are unblocked successively and begin to execute in parallel almost at the same time Since their processing time is less than that of the bottleneck when the bottleneck job nishes running this round each upstream jobs already generates a new segment So the pipeline keeps running without stopping The sliding window based pipeline algorithm only controls the launch of the rst upstream job to keep the pipeline running without stopping By controlling this job we guarantee there are enough but not too many buffered segments between this job and the bottleneck job to keep the bottleneck job busy The condition to trigger RankSelect job is as follows 1 This condition means that the total number of segments pending at and before the bottleneck job needs to be greater than the ratio of the total duration of upstream jobs over the duration of the bottleneck job Before the metric is available we use the upper bound instead which is the number of the upstream jobs It is derived since the duration of every job is less than that of the slowest job This indicates that the worst case using sliding window based pipeline is the same as using queue feedback based pipeline For long pipeline consisting of many upstream jobs whose duration is much less than that of the slowest job this algorithm is superior to the queue feedback based algorithm because of less in-”ight pending segments VI E VALUATION We con“gure the AdWork work”ow to run on 4 different servers with NFS setup Each job runs on a different slave The ads bids are generated in batch mode Each batch consists of 1000 ads bids The interval between two batches is exponentially distributed with the average interval set to 2 seconds RankSelect selects ads in a round which can be nished in less than half second as well as the Tag job Filter is the bottleneck processing each ad in 50 ms We tested the two pipeline algorithm using PipeFlow Figure 2\(a compares the average of top-N result collected in the archive le generated by Archive The sliding window algorithm obtains higher average value for top-N bids whatever N values No-control gives the worst results It is because RankSelect without any control selects many bids too early regardless of the higher bids coming in the future The sliding window algorithm is superior because of its strict control with more performance information being considered It enlightens us that with performance metrics involved as the job triggers work”ow scheduling can be more ef“cient The comparison of standard variance is shown in Figure 2\(b which proves the same results Figure 3 shows the throughputs of the work”ow and the relative arrival rate of Filter under three pipeline algorithms The throughputs only have slight different The reciprocal of the throughput is nearly the same with the duration of Filter which is the bottleneck This means the work”ow achieves highest throughput we can get under all the three pipelines The relative arrival rate of the input segments for Filter is 10 without any control while the segments are not piled up under queue-feedback and sliding-window control We randomly shut down the slaves and restarted them after a few seconds The work”ow continued executing to the normal state We also tested a single round of work”ow execution forcefully terminated between Tag and Filter

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even goodŽ partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity … the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the clouds elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPs synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and …in at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an oracleŽ approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workers time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling. The total time estimates for running BC on WG and CP graphs, normalized to  
 plot shows speedup of 8 workers relative to 4 workers, for each superstep, when running BC on WG and CP graphs plot shows the number of vertices active in that superstep Estimated time for BC using elastic scaling, normalized to time taken for 4 workers.

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts

All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
