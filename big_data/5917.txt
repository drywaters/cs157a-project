To use a simple example, for a typical software engineer the word 322 activity 323 refers to a node in a finite state machine; for an industrial engineer this refers to a workflow task  and for a typical business graduate this term refers to an entire organization. While these terms are related in the field, they are rarely related in the disciplinary curricula  Similar points are made in the emerging interdisciplinary field of Service s Science, Management Engineering and Design. Educators and rese archers have pointed out that despite the increasing contributions of services to economic growth, there is no common understanding of what phenomena underlying services and the dynamics of services ecosystems create and drive value  26   It has been argue d   that existing models traditionally used for describing the exchange of physical products, will not apply in the services context, in which close interactions between suppliers, service providers, and customers exist, where knowledge is created and exchanged, and experiences, capabilities, and relationships are an integral part of the transaction. In summary an advanced experiential curriculum is important, difficult to resource, and demanding in terms of knowledge and needed skills  Finally, studen ts have limited available credit hours in their programs  for the experience need ed  to correctly frame problems and solve them Thus the methods selected for the course had to be simple to introduce, but effective in providing a structure for future growth as innovators. These methods are presented below  C  Service Blueprint  In an effort to capture the needs of the service consumers of a complex enterprise we selected a tool that is used in consumer sciences known as the service blueprint  7 Th is framework  identifies the core, peripheral, and enabling services within the enterprise. In the  service blueprint, the core requires the student to identify the customer experience from a tangible and emotional perspective  The blueprint  is augmented with other services organizational and technology\ that have to be in place thus requiring the student to elaborate on how a customer interaction moves through the organization The service blueprint  builds on methods of both computer and consumer sciences  D  Translational Process  Translation usually uses research to improve the method s of working  to producing goods  and services  The result is an innovation The term complex innovation  is innovation  related to complex enterprise services Complex  innovation requires students to fully understand the underlying translational process cycles that are needed These cycles often start fr om in  situ  observations and  Fig 1 The Engineering Translational Process b ridging from d escriptive to n ormative theories based on 9   Fig 2 The course framework s an d relationships Service Blueprint for discovery, Agile for development; and Christensen for research identification   


understandings  i.e development of d escriptive t heories  Fig  1  left   Next these lead to subsequent cycles of theory b uilding that are well explained in 9   In particular we next wish to build on key points about theory building that Christensen makes and relate them  to the translational process involving  in particular  engineering  innovation research  First the descriptive stage of theory building  Fig  1  left\ is viewed as a preliminary stage because translational engineers must understand the context and causalities  that occur in the real world  e g  the complex healthcare system They then pass this understanding on to the development of a normative theory  Fig  1 right   The right side is the typical realm of more academic engineering researchers  Normative theories have the ability to predict outcomes of interest, not just what is correlated in the field. Anomalies are treated with great interest as they often refine theories We use the term translation  here for the process bridging between descriptive and normative theories in order to cycle between understandings to causalities  Second the translational process as in Fig  1  is not simply a one way process of taking ideas from university labs out to be applied in industry  Careful field based research  anomalies  an d correlations must also move back to inform technology  and engineering  research in the university  This deeper  normative understanding of predictability and repeatability is exactly what is needed as the basis for service automation and the development o f enabling technolo gy For example the design of  telemedicine solutions  must be based only on theories of automat ion because they are also repeat ed  in human interactions C are  must be taken not to over automate at the expense of usability This type of nuanced understanding begins with observations and the developm ent of a d escriptive t heory regarding the context of use  The typical innovation goal is often initially stated in broad  terms e.g  social media can be used to improve the health care enterpr ise Such a claim may never be warranted by existing underlying research  yet the innovation might be successful. In contrast, each academic research hypothes i s and its accompanying goal s are  typically narrow and rigorous \(e.g. text analytics tools can be  used to extract the positive sentiment of entities in micro blogs In other words within complex systems we may never complete all the research e.g due to wicked problems  6   and we may have to acknowledge that a single good research result might not have a perceptible impact on the economic performance of the whole system  There also is no guarantee that research investment will be successful in practice Innovation may be the result of research and development  but also more rarely, it cou ld be due to a 322 Eureka 323 moment  T hus many wicked problems  and different disciplinary perspectives need to be addressed for a typical complex system innovation  And  to achieve results ma n y translational cycles will typically be involved  W ays to enable t ranslational activity within the university a re discussed in [28   E  Agile Translation  Last but not least we introduce d a gile  development practices which form the process used to conduct the projects It consists of the following principles  based on 8   Since  the industry sponsor approves all work products based on achieving a translational goal state that is also funded, we point out that the work products are of value to an industry process or product  Thus each work product contributes incrementally t o a final innovation  III  I MPLEMENTING I NNOVATION 320  D IRECTED E XPERIENTIAL L EARNING  The students taking the course in Advanced Enterprise Architectures in Services were first  and second year master\325s and doctoral students seeking real world experience. Most were new to research  and most had a year of previous work or project experience  The steps in the course see  Fig 2  and curriculum is  as follows  1  Pro ject triage  At the start of class the  students were assigned projects and industry sponsors to work with These projects are typically in the domains of  healthcare education, insurance  and finance and government services The industry projects serve as a living lab or atory  or  sand box meaning  the  projects  represent the full messiness and complexity of real world enterprises  In this early phase the students were mainly introduced to the problem  We assigned team members as follows: the team leader was a doctoral or second year master\325s student The remaining team members were first year students with an interest in the project topic Thus there was a mentoring relationship  2  Develop s ervice b lueprint  In this phase  the students had to distill the messiness of the  problem into an abstraction that identified  from the consumer\325s perspective the true value of the final project  They were given a lecture on Service Blueprint  3  Follow a gile  practices   On an on going fashion  the students interacted with their sponsor s and created project implementation s  Concurrently  they did background and secondary research on related emerging trends  4  Identify research  Using Christensen\325s theory building framework  the students beg a n to understand and document where the unique contributions o f their work might lie  and developed a future project plan  They were introduced to Christensen\325s theory in two lectures  5  Wrap up The  groups  present to their sponsors the proje ct  plan and  the value of the project. And, they produce a research report describing their  publishable  work   


The course format was a hybrid online offline classroom  Required reading materials were posted to the course website prior to class and five clas ses  of a total twenty four  were spent on lectures Thus m ore time was spent on in class project discussions applying theory building and  service blueprint methods  The project environment s include d weekly activity tracking  of  students  kept private between the student and faculty advisor and a project environment with blogging for team collaboration  Google sites were used for access to the work products  by sponsors  IV  R ESULTS  Twenty students took the pilot course  in Spring 2013 six  doctoral studen ts  five  s econd year master 325s students  eight  first year master 325s students and one non traditional undergraduate   The course was being offered for the first time so we had little understanding on what to expect  Thus we viewed the course as a way to dis cover and frame hypotheses for future research  To assess  the effectiveness of this course and the instruction method we therefore prepared a survey for a longitudinal study to capture improvement in students 325 evaluation skills consequent to their instru ction with  the service blueprint  Christensen\325s framework  was presented at the end of the class  they had previous knowledge of Agile   We asked the same questions week three and week ten  How do you define computer science research How well do you feel  you are equipped with methodological knowledge for research How do you define computer science innovation? How well do you feel you are equipped with methodological knowledge for coming up with innovations Do you consider innovation skills to be essential for employment? Do you consider research skills to be essential for employment  The three groups are 320 group 1  nine first year masters students including one senior group 2  nine second year masters, and group 3  three doctoral \(playing mentor roles  We administered these questions at the start and towards the end of the semester  Given small numbers and absences we found no statistically  signi ficant change between  the pre instruction and post instruction surveys  But taken the responses taken along with additional feedback solicited at the end of the class from each group was insightful and useful for developing hypothes e s for further research We have thus organized our results from the perspective of hypotheses formi ng evidence below  Hypothesis: Graduate  students understand the need for evaluation skills  at the highest  level of Bloom\325s taxonomy  They can define terms like service innovation and research  and state the importance   Group 1  Several saw the need for project skills but d id not see the value of research and innovation skills for  their future job  search  They saw that the structure of the course as  322d ifferent 323  322 more autonomous 323  322 bigger picture 325 and 322n ot just 322start coding\323  They could see that they have to gather requirements and understand what they are doing  Relationship with companies leading to internships is a plus m ultidisciplinary perspective  is a plus m uch higher level class, more than coding, gives aspects of industry that s/he\325s never seen   Suggestions for the course 322p recisely define the terms 323 322g ive examples of hypothesis 320 unsure what it looks like 323 322g ood on boarding 323 322s tarted off seeming like an implementation course and  not a research course 323  Our observations: We did not structure the relationships between project and research adequately enough to ask more precise questions In retrospect we think this was because the class was a combination of project and lecture based with project discussio n dominating Thus the students focused on the Agile project aspects but did not focus on the vocabulary even though that was presented and tested  Hypothesis Technology Graduate students can be taught to focus on technology consumers and innovation  wit h Service Interaction modeling   We noted by examining the project work products, that with the introd uction of the service blueprint  each team shifted its thinking process from implementation technology provider mentality to the consumer  value  Most tea ms modified their blueprints several times as they thought more globally  In addition three Group 2 masters students developed satisfaction questionnaires for the technology consumers of their own innovations based on this T his was an important behavioral  shift we were attempting to achieve  Consequently in the next iteration of the class, we plan to have work product related questions  Hypothesis Mentoring is helpful  Group 1 322discussions with the team were helpful\323 322enjoyed working with partner men tor who is helpful\323 322class lectures were unclear I now understand enterprise projects, so the class was helpful\323  Group II Several group II students mentioned 322b enefitted a lot from working with a Ph D student 323 Suggestions for the course: \322s tart ear lier with Christensen\325s Theory Building 323 322t oo long of a warm up period not enough time to do the research\323  322n o direct tie between the EA  enterprise architecture  foundation and the class work i mprove teaching of EA 323 Hypothesis Graduate students need  to be taught all three frameworks and the relationships between them  Group III  322 Was previously unsure of how to write an  acad emic paper\323, \322t he time wasn\325t too short, as s/he came in with more preparation 323  322g ot good insights for own personal research 323  322d idn\325t know previously how to proceed with research now has some sense on how to do research 323, \322d ifficult to extract research from projects 323 Out 


observations, Group II and Group III were more able to see the benefits of the service interaction model and  the relationships to the Christensen\325s model  These responses provide some overall guidance on how to improve the experiential learning  1  Include m ore explicit in class discussions  on the terminology  For instance include an explicit discussion about both  Christensen\325s theory building model and innovation versus research One way to proceed  given limited time is to introduce a class simulation  that illustrates the differences between research and innovation and the different types of reasoning processes  2  Make the doctoral student experience more explicit  Doctoral students gain because they get several teams working on exploring different ideas related to their research  This needs to be made more explicit  3   Poor access to relevant knowledge  We also make  other  broader observations  related to the environment  The conduct of an experiential curriculum and its accompanying translational activities is knowledge intensive and the resourcing has related challenges  as the faculty member has to have both explic it research background and deep industry experience Confronted with typical sponsor needs in industry, we have also found that the typical academic research paper is often too narrow to solve the whole problem and show benefits to the end consumer. This  we believe makes it increasingly difficult  to derive  innovations  in short academic timeframes  For example d uring  the problem framing stage it is typical to find thousands of academic publications that match keywords of interest  A simple search in Google Scholar for 322 adaptive complex enterprise 323 yields over six million results  Even so, most academic research papers do not address the whole problem and are too discipline  specific. Practice papers are too generic or vendor specific  More integrative approaches to presenting research and practice must be explored to further the translational process. In particular, new approaches to the publication of translation al  work products and data sets related to the paper should be considered   V  C ONCLUSIONS  There is a growing gap between technology consumers and technology providers This is also mirrored as the related gap between academic research rigor and effective ness in  practice  Thus  from an  I/UCRC  perspective  we are interested in ask ing c an advanced graduate students within experiential courses become the engine for translational activities and innovation  related to complex systems  The challenges to be addressed include lack of understanding of the 1\ enterprise context, and 2\ research and innovation processes To address this we have proposed an advanced interdisciplinary curriculum framework integrating service blueprints from consumer science  Christensen\325s theory building from business  and agile practices from software engineering  We provide specifics of implementation and observations based on a pilot implementation  Our preliminary results show that w hile the application of technology increasingly depends on consumer context this context can be quickly abstracted  using available tools like s ervice b lueprints  Subsequent a gile management  of projects and extracti on of  research abstractions  using Christensen\325s t heory building is feasible within the constraints of one semester  This approach has the potential of a sustaining industry university structure that can benefit graduate student learning experiences and translational researchers We have shown that students can acquire all the needed knowledge and deliver value within a limited time  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was done under the aegis of the Center for Experimental Research in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and The Ohio State University funded by the National Science Foundation 325 s I  UCRC program  NSF IIP 0753710  Funding was also pro vided by The Ohio Board of Regents Computer Science Graduate Education program and by the National Science Foundation Course Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement program   NSF CCLI Phase 0837555  We wish to acknowledge the helpful ideas by our  colleague s  especially Dr Jay Kandampully for his presentations and insights into the service blueprint, CETI  members and sponsors  R EFERENCES  1  R  C  Basole  and  W  B  Rouse  322Complexity  of  service  value  networks  Conceptualization  and  empirical  investigation.\323  IBM  Systems  Journal  vol  47  no  1  pp  53 320 70  2008  2  J Ramanathan  322 Fractal architecture for the adaptive complex enterprise 323  Communications of the ACM vol. 48  no. 5, pp. 51 320 57 May 2005   3  J McKendrick 322 Line of business tech budgets may soon top IT department budgets: Gartner 323.

 We note that for most strings the parallel suf\223x tree code alone takes as much time or more time than our entire LZ-factorization algorithm and since a suf\223x tree-based LZ-factorization algorithm involves many other procedures e.g tree contraction least common ancestors and Euler tours it is unlikely that such an algorithm will have a better overall performance We have presented a simple parallel algorithm for Lempel-Ziv factorization which requires

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
