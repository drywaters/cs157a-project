There have been many efforts to distinguish game BOT users from normal users Several studies have proposed BOT detection models based on the analysis of users  in game action sequence data. These studies indicated that the analysis of users  in game actions is effective to detect BOTs. However, they do not use sufficiently large data sets to train and test their algorithms In this paper, we have proposed a BOT detection model that uses users  in game action sequence data obtained with the aid of big data analysis environments We did empirical analysis of the dataset of   the third largest MMORPG in Korea The result shows that a large amount of sequence data leads to high accuracy en-US Keywords BOT detection  sequence data Na\357ve Bayesian classifier; online game security en-US I   I NTRODUCTION  en-US A game BOT is a well-crafted AI program that can play a game without any human interaction or control Game BOTs can do harm and shorten the life cycle of the game 1   W e collaborated with NC Soft, Inc., one of the largest MMORPG service companies We fully analyze long-term user activity logs with the aid of a big data analysis platform en-US II  R ELATED W ORK  en-US The studies for detecting game BOTs have been classified into three categories: server-side, network-side, and client-side 1 2   Netw o r k s id e B O T  d e tec ti o n  ass u m e s  th at t r a f f ic  information represents disparate characteristics of human players and BOTs 3   C li en t s id e d ete cti o n  m eth o d s  ac q u ir e  action data directly through user involvement. Server-side BOT detection methodology is based on data mining techniques that analyze log data from game servers In general it is hard to modify server-side logs with deliberate intent un less hackers penetrate and compromise the game servers. Thus, server-side detection methods are more secure than client-side methods Previous studies on server-side BOT detection methods select ed features from a vast array of user actions, and applied data mining techniques [3  4  5  6   M o s t  o f  th ese  s tu d ies  u s e d  one-dimensional log data due to computational complexity in spite of the fact that game BOT traces are found in multidimensional log data en-US We choose the users  in game action log as a dataset Whenever a user does an action e.g hunting in the game world then the game server generates an action log for each user s action We build the action sequence data from the dataset Th e sequence data with time-stamp information is higher-dimensional In this paper we employ big data technology by Hadoop system for minimizing the loss of information  Additionally Na\357ve Bayesian is adopted in this study because the log data used is relatively large in terms of both its count and noise levels en-US III  E MPIRICA L S TUDY  en-US A  Data Description en-US In-game action stored in the game log represents the behavior of characters in the game 110 kinds of log events were used for creating sequence patterns Table 1 shows the information, including size and periods, of the training and test data Before applying the sequence data for training data preprocessing is needed to eliminate the insignificant data.

IaaS components include hw0 hypervisor hwU dom0 domU app0 appU disk0 diskU mem0 and memU The rst four components were already discussed in Section II-A Hw0 is the same as hw in Figure 1 0 indicates that it is managed and owned by a provider AppU and app0 are applications that runs inside domU and dom0 respectively Disk0 is a physical disk of the hw0 and diskU is a virtual disk of a domU Mem0 is a main memory of the hw0 and memU is a virtual main memory of domU P1-P4 are logging processes that perform logging-related tasks F1-F4 are log les that are used for storing contents produced by the logging processes This paper deìnes  It would be very serious for any company if its business adversaries can access its critical les e.g business database les Figure 3 sho ws the location of a critical le called f in diskU within the template Critical les can be created inside domUs or may be uploaded via the Internet by customers from their local machines to diskUs in the cloud For EC2 customers upload les to domUs to run their systems for example in medical experiments 6 7 In 5 in order to more quickly nd new drugs to heal new diseases a computer intensive scientiìc experiment can be conducted in EC2 After EC2 domUs launched all essential software the input les and executable C program les are transferred to the diskUs Thus all these les in diskUs are critical from the point of view of the owner of these domUs Figure 3 shows the location of a critical le called f in diskU Thus one can clarify all components logging components IaaS components and this critical le in one view This view assists us to analyse and nd solutions to mitigate risks associated with CSA threats regarding both providers and customers In Figure 3 the dot-arrow line virtually shows that Alice Fig 3 Illustration of a location of a critical le f in diskU the domU owner accesses her critical le f using the appU However forms of threat 1 such as customer VMs attacker others VMs fully discussed in Section III may allow attackers to control this appU and use it to access the le maliciously III T HREAT 1 AFFECTS A C USTOMER AND P ROVIDER Some forms of attacks enclosed in threat 1 e.g criminals use domUs to attack other domUs or dom0 can be critical This is because they can eventually cause CSA threat 5 data loss or leakage which may occur in domUs This threat has been ranked as top in order of severity by the recent CSA reports 22 CSA state that the se v erity of this threat can be a devastating impact on the damage to oneês business brand and reputations or loss of core intellectual property Thus we provide an in-depth analysis of the impact threat 1 can have on both customers and providers simultaneously  demonstrate ho w to use a domU to extract the private keys of another domU in an Xen-Cloud environment e.g EC2 CSA also argue that domUs can host malicious software that has proven especially effective in compromising critical private resources in cloud environments Although the y did not mention that the critical private resource is belong to whom it may have belonged to customers Especially also ar gue that a b usiness competitor of a victim domU can use a malicious domU to attack the victim domU Then the competitor may be able to read private data or compromise the victim domU Thus domU attacks domU can cause a serious effect on cloud customers such as malicious access to loss or leakage of threat 5 the customers critical les e.g database les Virtualization vulnerabilities in Windows 2008 the hypervisor allow domU running under the hypervisor to crash the Windows 2008 host dom0 Thus a domU can control dom0 and exploit the other domUs hosted on the same physical machine After dom0 is compromised attack ers can get control on the entire domUs Thus the y may obtain root accounts of these domUs log into them access the domUs critical les see Figure 3 and as discussed in Section II-C above If these les are the customers business databases this can be a very serious incident ar gue that as dom0 can transparently read and write the memory content of the domU using the management interface thus if dom0 is compromised by attackers they may use this interface to steal the valuable information from any domU It is also argued by that dom0 can access all data in diskUs This can be a serious security concern from the point of view of the customers Again it can be crucial when dom0 is compromised because then all domUs could be at risks 26 states that domUs can attack the dom0 that hosts them state that this is because of a difìculty in clarifying the borders between a dom0 and domUs in the same physical machine with virtualization infrastructure Thus these unclear borders can be one of the attack channels Another channel can be vulnerabilities in dom0 An example can be holes in the management consoles of dom0 that allow attackers to gain the root privileged in this dom0 as argued by Moreo v er  after dom0 is compromised it can be used by attackers to monitor domUs eavesdrop of communications between domU and dom0 take control of all domUs and inject malware into domU images 
C Customers Critical Files in DomUs A Effects on A Customer due to Threat 1 1 DomU attacks domU 2 DomU attacks dom0 and uses this dom0 to attack other domUs B Effects on Provider due to Threat 1 1 Criminals can use domUs to attack provider dom0 
critical les as les in diskUs that are owned by customers domUês owners These les can be any le type such as text executable or database les They are the customers asset and valuable for their businesses Thus the customers do not want anyone to access these les apart from themselves and their authenticated users and do not want loss or leakage of the les

There are many forms of attacks enclosed in threat 1 such as all the incidents caused by threat 1 discussed in Section III-A It seems that theses incidents affect only customer security concerns However these incidents can also affect provider security concerns for example allowing attackers to control dom0 and use it to compromise all domUs Then attackers especially the competitors of the victim domUs may access lose or leak customers critical les threat 5 Others forms of attacks enclosed in threat 1 also can be domUs that host spamming activities or downloads for illegal software Thus if the customers know that a lot of criminals or all mentioned forms of attacks enclosed in threat 1 are inside the providerês cloud infrastructure this can impact on the providers The impacts can be losing the providerês business reputations which can be important for customers when deciding to buy cloud products or these attacks can be an indicator of vulnerabilities in the provider infrastructure Then the customers may not want to buy or rent the product from this provider IV P ROPOSED L OGGING S OLUTIONS TO M ITIGATE R ISKS A SSOCIATED W ITH T HREAT 1 TO BENEFIT BOTH SIDES As discussed in the compromising of both domUs or dom0 in Section III either domUs or dom0 compromising may have the result of undesired access to or loss or leakage of customers critical les Thus we propose to have a history of each of these critical les This paper applies work by PASSXen and HP TrustCloud to form the deìnition of the history of a critical le PASSXen is a system that can collect the information on the creation access and destruction of a le in the domU TrustCloud is a framework to deal with the lack of trust in the cloud It has le-centric information on domUs that is obtained by tracing domUs data and les since they were created until deleted Thus  This paper discusses only some information of the periods accessed as discussed below If a critical le f is s.txt in Figure 3 the content of history of s.txt as a log le can be Table I In the table f nm is the name of critical le e.g s.txt p id e.g 4624 and p nm e.g read is the id and name of the process that accesses this le respectively and p ownId e.g 1002 Alice Id is the id of the owner of this process Sections V and VI discuss how to obtain this information The content of the table can be more complex to provide more precise evidence which will be discussed in the discussion Section VII Discussion f nm p id p nm p ownId s.txt 4624 read 1002\(alice s.txt 4800 read It would be useful if we had a history of each of domUês critical les to assist in indicating for example who has access to these les and which appU accesses them The history information can enhance accountability in the cloud and customers conìdence For example for threat 1 when Alice domU is compromised by attackers then they may control appU to access her critical le f s.txt as shown in Figure 3 discussed in Section III-A The history of f the information such as which appU accesses s.txt when and by whom this appU belonged to can be used to clarify this undesired malicious incident by the attackers History of critical les could assist in analysing attacker behaviours inside domUs To analyse attacker behaviours Alice can check row 2 column 4 in Table I and may discover that someone else Bob accesses her critical le s.txt The content of the table can be more complex to provide more precise evidence which will be discussed in Section VII In Table I when one discovers that Bob has accessed Aliceês critical le s.txt this can be a trigger for the providers to be aware that their dom0 may be compromised To identify malicious Bob accurately they can conduct further investigation for example by pinpointing Bobês Id p ownId column 4 the appU name p nm column 1 he used to access s.txt or s.txt le name Then they can gather more necessary evidence For example this can be achieved by recording Bobês appU behaviours as done in a case study of or monitoring this appU/domU for malicious network trafìc as done in Thus the history of critical les can be of beneìt the provider This paper uses Linux processes as an example of processes in a domU and uses a process and command interchangeably Actually an appU in the template becomes one or more processes/commands This paper assumes that each appU becomes only one process The provenance collection in PASSXen also has the creation access and destruction of processes in domUs However this paper brieîy discusses  For example command   is when a cat concatenate command in Linux is accessing the text le Table II can be an example of a cat process behaviour log le The content of the log of the cat can be the name of the process p nm cat the id of the process p id 4000 the 
the history of a critical le in this paper is the information on the le since it was created until permanently deleted Precisely it is records of three periods of a critical leês life time created accessed and destroyed a process behaviour log le as a record of some of the processês activities such as the process name and id a le name of a le that this process has access to and the owner id of the process 
TABLE I T HE CONTENT OF THE HISTORY OF CRITICAL FILE F  S  TXT  ADAPTED FROM  In the case of some incidents happening in domUs that have negative effects on customers or providers the history of critical les can be used as evidence to clarify what happened with these domUs This evidence can be a clue to discover what is going on inside the domUs that contain the critical les Section IV-A2 IV-A3 VII-A VII-B discuss how to discover the causes of the incidents Consequently the evidence should mitigate risks associated with threat 1 e.g criminal domUs As a result this should mitigate causes of negative impact on both customer and provider companies such as brand damage as discussed in Section III-A III-B

the logging components in dom0 also need to consider the other security aspects as discussed below The solutions for these security issues is out of the scope of this paper First  we use the logging system architecture Figure 5 as a tool for this analysing For example the security relevant question is how to ensure the integrity of the log les that are stored in disk0 which are fully owned and controlled by a provider The provider may maliciously learn about or alter the log les Second  the next security relevant question is how can an auditor ensures the integrity of the logger or libVMI which is run by the provider in dom0 Locating these components in this location can be a security risk This is because the provider may maliciously modify the loggerês code to produce contents of log les which beneìt himself We discuss only the questions above as an example of the analysis of the proposed logging system VI T HE R ESULT AND HOW TO OBTAIN I T In Figure 5 the logger command app0 runs in dom0 the 1st line in Figure 6 It keeps checking memU until read command is performed and existed in memU When read command is performed in domU the 1st line in Figure 7 the logger then keeps waiting until the read command reads s.txt When the read command starts reading s.txt the 2nd line in Figure 7 the logger immediately extracts necessary information 2nd line of Figure 6 These information are the le name s.txt read process name read process id 4624 and the id of the owner of read command 1002 After that the logger writes this extracted information to F3 Fig 6 The logger running in dom0 to record history of critical le s.txt Fig 7 The read command running in domU and reading critical le s.txt To obtain a critical le name s.txt Figure 8 shows the detail of les point Step 1 in Figure 8 les is a pointer of read processês that points to structure It contains an fdt pointer that points to the rst open le or inside structure step 2 Each points to each open le that is opened by read process step 3-4 It is assumed that read process is reading s.txt which is pointed by step 4 Figure 9 shows how after the logger locates pointer step 4 that logger obtains the le name string s.txt Step 1 the logger nds f path eld inside structure which is a structure This structure contains a dentry pointer which points to structure step 2 contains d name that is a structure step 3 which has the name pointer eld that points to string s.txt step 4 Fig 8 Detail of les pointer of read processês In the experiment the domU is for a single user However Alice owns two accounts the root can run all appUs in the domU and alice an administrator An example of the complete content of history of s.txt Table III can be constructed from the result 2nd line of Figure 6 Note that last acc column 5 presents the last accessed times of the le The asterisks  in the following tables indicate possible malicious events in domUs When the history of s.txt f nm p id p nm p ownId last acc s.txt 4624 read 1002 t1 s.txt 4002 read 1002 t2 s.txt 4003 maliciousRead 1002 t3 s.txt 4004 read 1003 t4 TABLE III A N E XAMPLE OF T HE COMPLETE CONTENT OF THE HISTORY OF S  TXT is available to Alice she may audit s.txt For example row 1 can be a normal event when Alice logs in to her domU Then she runs her read appU p nm to access s.txt f nm the dot-arrow line in Figure 4 with her or root permission The history of s.txt Table III shows Aliceês Id 1002 in column 4 In the case rootês or Aliceês password is compromised which may be caused by threat 1 row 2-3 can be suspect incidents relate to her le Row 2 can be undesired access to s.txt The reason can be that Alice has never accessed s.txt at t2 time column 5 Thus she may suspect that attackers may have accessed s.txt Another case in row 3 Alice has never used maliciousRead appU column

3 to access s.txt Thus she may also suspect that attackers may be doing this After pinpointing maliciousRead in order to obtain more evidence for auditing she may make further investigations using other methods e.g network monitoring as used in 32 The domU in this implementation can be used by multiple users Thus Aliceês domU have a root user Alice an administrator and Bob a standard user who shares and can log in to Aliceês domU As discussed in Section III-A this domU can be compromised by threat 1 Thus attackers may obtain both Bobês and rootês password Then they may log in to Aliceês domU using Bobês account Thus they can run Aliceês read appU with root permission to access s.txt Thus the evidence can be row 4 of Table III This row can be a suspect incident that why and how Bob id 1003 in column 4 row 4 accesses Aliceês s.txt Although the attacker uses the same appU read in column 3 row 4 which is normally used by Alice to access s.txt the log from our experiment still shows Bobês Id 1003 which is not an owner of s.txt Consequently Alice could eventually discover this suspicion from the history of s.txt Thus the history information in Table III can be evidence to assist in analysing undesired incidents inside domUs As a result this can mitigate risks associated with threat 1 to beneìt customers To enhance exibility of auditing in the cloud using logging systems the logger can be modiìed For example an auditor may want to know whether a particular appU as one that has an ability to view text les e.g gedit in Linux read s.txt or not Thus it is possible to modify the logger to record the history of this particular process instead of history of s.txt Thus this type of log le could be as in Table IV which shows a list of all les that were accessed by gedit Then the auditor can check whether this process reads s.txt or not In the table the auditor can see that gedit reads s.txt row 2 column 3 Thus this type of log les can be useful to enable exibility of the auditing p nm p id to le nm p ownId gedit 4000 a.txt 1002 gedit 4003 s.txt 1002 TABLE IV A LIST OF ALL FILES ACCESSED BY GEDIT APP U For dealing with the compromising of dom0 as discussed in Section

guidelines Our proposed system architecture inherits these requirements while achieving the history of critical les The rst two requirements are no superîuous modiìcations to the hypervisor and no modiìcations to domUs These requirements involve a trusted computing base TCB which is a signiìcant factor when building logging systems in the cloud This is because in order to evaluate the trustworthiness of a software system e.g our proposed logging system it is necessary to identify its TCB Thus the size of the TCB should be as small as possible Ho we v er  36 points out that an OS is dif cult to analyse because of its size and complexity He also argues that there is too much TCB when deploying an application in an OS e.g domUs that is running on top of a hypervisor ar gue that an OS code changes rapidly over time The changes may increase the size of the OS and its complexity and as a result its TCB Thus the TCB can be a very important aspect of security in order to propose logging systems in the cloud For example the proposed systems in 35 19 38 that can be considered as solutions to mitigate risks associated with the cloud problem concern reducing the TCB size along with their proposed systems Recent work that extensively relates to a secure cloud computing environment such as that of also focuses on reducing the TCB in their proposed architecture Thus this section discusses related work that involves logging or detecting mechanism in an IaaS It also compares the logging system in this paper with those in related work based on TCB and achieving a history of critical les First Flogger and P ASSXen 17 can pro vide a history of critical les However Flogger has logging processes that are distributed across domU and dom0 PASSXen also has logging processes that are distributed across the hypervisor domU and dom0 Therefore the proposed architecture in this paper yields less TCB than Flogger and PASSXen This is because the TCB of our architecture includes only hypervisor and dom0 not domU whereas their TCB includes domU Second propose a network monitoring application that identiìes which process inside a Windows domU is responsible for malicious network trafìc leaving this domU Additionally present a demo monitoring program in dom0 that outputs all le/directory creation/removals happening in domUês root directory Both works deploy XenAccess in dom0 Thus these systems have small TCB hw0 Xen and dom0 the same as the proposed architecture in this paper However they are not designed to achieve a history of critical les but could be modiìed

cesses and les in a customer VM For auditing purposes this history information can be investigated by a third party Thus this information may disclose customer business activities or malicious activities inside providerês cloud infrastructure This leads to privacy and conìdentiality issues of both customers and providers However ar gue the pri v ac y issues is manageable For example it is important to consider what is being recorded and who can access this recorded information Thus logging system management should return the recorded information at different levels of detail depending on who needs it To address the privacy and conìdentiality issues this may lead to further research such as balancing the privacy and its usage e.g This is out of the scope of this paper  VIII C ONCLUSIONS We argue that Cloud Security Alliance/CSA threat 1 related to criminal activities in customers VMs such as spamming can have serious effects for both provider and customer sides The examples are compromising providerês hosting system/dom0 consequently customer virtual machines The paper then proposes implements and discusses logging solutions to mitigate risks associated with threat 1 in infrastructure as a service IaaS cloud We argue that our result can be used to form log les called history of critical les and process behaviour log les We then demonstrate in detail how these log les can mitigate the risks to beneìt both sides To collect the log les our proposed system yields smaller trusted computing base TCB compared to previous work 17 Although work by 19 can yield the same TCB as our proposed system However they are not designed to achieve the history of critical les as discussed in this paper When we have the full implementation of the proposed system it should be an appropriate point to have the evaluation of the system performance impact or the scalability However history of critical les and process behaviour log in this paper can be important evidence to clarify what is going on in the cloud Thus these log les assist in enhancing the accountability in the cloud consequently assist in mitigating risks associated with CSA threats to beneìt both consumers and providers R EFERENCES  R Cho w  P  Golle M Jak obsson E Shi J Staddon R Masuoka and J Molina Controlling data in the cloud outsourcing computation without outsourcing control in

in Hadoop which we called HFSP Our work brought up several challenges evaluating job size on-line without wasting resources avoiding job starvation both on small and large jobs and guaranteeing short sojourn time despite estimation errors were the most noteworthy We solved these problems in the context of a multi-server system using virtual time and aging that is built to be tolerant to failures scale-out upgrades and supports the composite job structure of MapReduce We showed that a size-based discipline such as HFSP performs very well and that a precise job size information is not essential for the scheduler to function properly Our experimental results in which we compared HFSP to the widely used FAIR scheduler indicate that both interactivity and efìciency requirements were largely met both small and large jobs do not starve and the job sojourn time distribution is consistently in favor of HFSP Our work has practical consequences as well HFSP is simple to conìgure and allows resource pools to be consolidated because workload diversity is intrinsically accounted for by the size-based discipline Our future work is related to job preemption We are currently investigating a novel technique to ll the gap between killing running tasks and waiting for tasks to nish Indeed killing a task too late is a huge waste of work and waiting for a task to complete when it just started is detrimental as well Our next goal is thus to provide a new set of primitives to suspend and resume tasks to achieve better preemption A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work has been partially supported by the
