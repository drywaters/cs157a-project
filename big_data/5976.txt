I I NTRODUCTION Many complex queries over massive data or big data have received considerable attention recently with the emergence of a large number of practical applications in domains like sensor network RFID network data cleaning location-based service network traf“c analysis market surveillance and traf“c monitoring with radar Moreover the data in these scenarios are often generated dynamically and continuously even with uncertainty 2 F or e xample in the application of hazardous weather monitoring with radar networks a 
large amount of meteorological data are collected continuously and fed to the real-time processing system to predict natural disasters like tornados and severe storms In all these scenarios it is highly desirable to conduct timely data analysis over the complex data streams In the complex streaming environments the challenge of the query mainly lies in various aspects such as the computational complexity the streaming complexity and the query requirements First the computation of the query such as probabilistic skyline query and nearest-neighbor query 6 is CPU-intensive which requires powerful processing capability Second the fast arriving rate e.g 200Mb/sec from a single radar node as well as the limited storage space forces us to seek ef“cient algorithms over sliding windows Third the 
strict limit of the response time and the large sliding window concerned by the users make the query more challenging Nevertheless the existing centralized query techniques  are hard to meet the query requirements which spurs us to explore the parallel processing techniques for the complex queries Cloud computing as a new emerging distributed computing paradigm driven by economies of scale provides abundant computing resources to users with minimal management effort in the data centers Cloud is a platform or an infrastructure that enables execution of codes services applications in a managed and elastic way In computational view cloud computing is actually a network of data centers and is described as a powerful low-cost and energy-ef“cient approach to future computing which has the potential to yield f ast response

queries over data streams which mainly stems from the following facts 1 The frameworks are mainly designed for the parallel processing for various tasks over static data based on the distributed le systems but not for the queries over data streams without any le management systems 2 The tasks in many complex queries cannot be partitioned into many individual and independent computational tasks especially for the queries that do not satisfy the additivity such as the uncertain skyline top

processing over data streams in cloud computing environments Speci“cally we propose a eneral framework for arallelizing treaming queries called  To summarize we provide the following contributions in this paper For the rst time we propose a general framework GPS for parallel queries over data streams with the window-based data stream model We further propose a hierarchical and general parallel model for queries over data streams based on the GPS We conduct the experiments of the skyline queries over uncertain data streams based on our proposed parallel framework with real deployment as an example to verify the effectiveness and ef“ciency of our proposals The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section II presents the proposed framework GPS in detail which includes the introduction of the GPS architecture and discussion of the optimization from various aspects Section III describes the hierarchical and general parallel model based on the GPS which is exclusively designed for parallel queries over data streams We extensively evaluate the performances of our proposals from many aspects in Section IV Finally we conclude the paper and outline our future work in Section V II G ENERAL P ARALLEL F RAMEWORK To realize the parallel processing for the queries over data streams we rst propose a general parallel framework for the queries and the overall structure is summarized in Fig 1 From Fig 1 we can see that there are several layers and modules in the framework The bottom is the fundamental communication platform which is mainly responsible for the communication of the nodes involved in the parallel processing The platform can be implemented with various middlewares and in our prototype we adopt Ice  which is an object-oriented middleware The upper layer is the module for the input and management of data streams which mainly consists of three submodules including the probing module the preprocessing module and the caching and storage module The probing module is mainly responsible for probing the streaming rate and throughput to optimize the later query processing Preprocessing mainly includes the work of data cleaning transformation and loading to adapt to the queries The cache and storage module is responsible for optimizing the access and storage of the streaming data Based on the underlying management of the streaming data we can adopt various models for data stream analysis The most popular are the window-based models which mainly contains the landmark model sliding window model and snapshot model in which the sliding window model is the most frequently used Moreover according to criteria of the physical and logical model as well as updating time interval the sliding window model can be divided into count-based sliding window and time-based sliding window as well as tumbling window sliding window and jumping window respecti v ely  queries nearest neighbor queries range queries key-word queries aggregate queries join queries and frequent items queries over data streams According to the introduction of the parallel framework addressed before we can see that there are many problems needs to be further considered and solved which are also the directions of our current and future work The characteristics of data streams such as real-time response and single-pass make a huge challenge to the queries over data streams Besides data streams exhibit unpredictability as they may be sometimes slow but sometimes very fast with high throughput Therefore we need to analyze the blocks of the incoming items according to the real states of the streams so as to process the streaming data timely and accurately Thus to avoid the over”ow of memory or the incorrectness deriving from the over”ow of the items we need to take fully into account the size of input streaming data block and adaptively adjust the size according to the capability of the parallel system Load balancing is one of the most important goals of the distributed systems which aims to avoid the case that too heavy a load in some of the nodes while the other nodes are idle Studying the load balancing strategies not only can avoid the performance degradation or a single point of failure but also can improve the resource utilization Thus we need to consider the loads of the nodes

Fig 1 The architecture of GPS when we assign tasks based on the window partitioning Besides we can dynamically adjust the loads in each node Thus exploring dynamic load balancing algorithms or load shedding techniques is also a very important aspect for designing the general parallel query framework A large number of studies indicate that the index structure can effectively improve the query processing 18 W e also belie v e that the index can improve the parallel queries over data streams First starting from the global data or the nodes develop the distributed or parallel index for the whole streaming items or the parallel nodes Second study the index techniques to optimize the processing in each node so as to improve the performance of the whole system Third since we may adopt some special data structures to optimize the queries if we can use some index structures to organize or index the data structures the query can also be signi“cantly improved The organization of the processing nodes not only refers to the architecture of the parallel query processing but also relates to the query ef“ciency Generally the organization of nodes includes the organization of the network connection structure and the organization of the nodes according to the correlation of the streaming items The former is the fundamental structure for parallel query processing and the latter is an effective way to optimize the parallel query processing Similarly we can also organize the streaming items with a certain data mapping strategies to disseminate the data to the processing nodes to improve the queries Since the query needs fast response and all the data are maintained in the memory during the query processing we believe that replication method is more suitable than others like data coding Therefore we choose replication method to achieve the fault-tolerance in GPS Failures are normal rather than exceptional in the cloud computing environments For example Google has reported 5 average worker deaths per Map-Reduce job and at least one disk f ailure in every run of a 6-hour Map-Reduce job on a cluster of 4,000 machines Moreo v er  as the number of components increases so does the probability of failure Once failures are happened during the query process the query results would be incorrect and the continuous query may be interrupted which waste plenty of computing resources and seriously affects the query experience of the users Therefore we need to study the fault-tolerant strategies to solve the problems which include the fault detection task migration and rapid recovery for the queries Thus we need to recover the parallel queries with minimal cost such as to make full use of the results that have already calculated and avoid the problem of double counting To evaluate the performance of a parallel framework for the queries over data streams a variety of evaluation approaches or metrics must be considered in its design The approaches or the metrics should have a certain versatility and fairness as well as can

practically re”ect the performance of parallel processing The typical metrics for evaluation in GPS include query processing rate load-balance scalability fault-tolerant or robustness the query complexity in time and space III G ENERAL P ARALLEL M ODEL In this section we propose a hierarchical and general parallel model for queries over data streams which corresponds to the module for parallel processing in our proposed framework The structure of the model is shown in Fig 2   Fig 2 The hierarchical and general parallel processing model for queries over data streams Generally there are two ways to translate a centralized processing to parallel processing i.e data partitioning and task partitioning which are fully considered in our parallel model First we parallelize the query by partitioning the whole query tasks into many subtasks and assign each task to a layer thus the query processing can be vertically parallelized Second we further parallelize the query by assigning the processing tasks on the whole streaming data in a layer to many processing nodes thus all the nodes in a layer are involved in the parallel processing for the tasks on their own local streaming items As shown in Fig 2 the whole general parallel processing model is organized as a hierarchical parallel processing structure The model includes several layers and the number of layers is de“ned by the users In each layer we organize the nodes to parallel execute the tasks assigned in the layer The nodes in the upper layers connect with the nodes in the lower layers with some mapping rule and the nodes in each layer can in parallel execute the tasks for the queries Generally all the parallel queries over data streams based on the aforementioned parallel model mainly include the following ve processing levels  we rstly map the active streaming data to the nodes in the rst layer with a certain mapping rule de“ned by the users  the nodes in this layer execute the query processing in parallel in the rst layer then push the results to the next level  we map the results produced by the upper level with a certain rule to initiate a new round of parallel processing in the layer  similar to the initial aggregation level the main task in this layer is to further execute the task that assigned in it  this layer is mainly responsible for collecting the nal results from the calculation by the nal processing layer Generally in many queries over data streams we may only need to consider for the processing with one layer but in some complex queries the query processing may refer to several layers thus to do the parallel query processing with our proposed framework can signi“cantly improve the queries In particular the nodes between two adjacent layers not necessarily with one by one mapping rule and we only need to design the rules for the speci“c queries Fig 3 The parallel model with 1-layer For simplicity we abstract one layer to explain the general query processing with the proposed parallel model Speci“cally as shown in Fig 3 there exist three kinds of nodes in our parallel processing settings   the node is responsible for mapping and delivering the arriving streaming items to the parallel computing nodes   the nodes are responsible for the computation for their maintained local streaming items which can communicate with

  the node is responsible for outputting the nal updated query results from all the processing nodes to the users Note that in each layer there actually exist two levels i.e a mapping level and an aggregation level Although this structure is similar to the MapReduce GPS is more exible than MapReduce as all the nodes can directly communicate with others in each layer Besides many assistant nodes can also be used in each layer to improve the query if necessary thus the role of each node can be exibly de“ned and not only the map or reduce node In the aforementioned general model for parallel query processing over data streams each layer is individually designed for different query tasks In our design of each layer two essential types of parallel processing models are proposed centralized parallel model CPM and distributed parallel model DPM As shown in Fig 4 can directly communicate with the peer nodes but the peer nodes need not communicate with each other When the streaming data comes to node  forwards the data to the peer nodes with some user de“ned rule Each peer node maintains two sliding windows and  where denotes the global sliding window and is the local sliding window Note that each peer node is responsible for processing the queries for the data in the window  In this model the global sliding window are divided into multiple sub-windows  which are assigned to the nodes  respectively Speci“cally it satis“es that and  which means that there is no overlap between any two sub-windows Fig 4 Centralized parallel model In this model since each peer node maintains the global skyline window each node can ensure the correctness of the querying results and need not communicate with each other However since this model demands that each node maintains two sliding windows in memory and the size of the sliding window can be too large this model may consume too much memory resources and decrease the processing ef“ciency when the memory space is not enough From the analysis we can see that this parallel model try to exchange the communicate overhead with the memory overhead which is more suitable for the applications that are more concerned about the network communication overhead Data stream DS e 6  e 5  e 4  e 3  e 2  e 1  e 0 Fig 5 Distributed parallel model To further explore the parallelism and reduce the memory overhead we propose a distributed parallel model for the queries over data streams As shown in Fig 5 can directly interact with the peer nodes and all the peer nodes can also communicate with others When the data arrives to  alternatively forwards the data to the peer nodes in the corresponding layer Each peer node maintains a local sliding window  Similar to CPM it also satis“es that and in DPM In DPM each peer node does not need to maintain any global sliding window but only a local sliding window is maintained Peer nodes can execute the parallel queries by communicating with others when the interactions for the queries are needed Thus DPM can ef“ciently realize the parallel query processing with less memory overhead Note that in both CPM and DPM another important problem that we need to address is the load balance Particularly in order to achieve the target we try to assign the partitions of the global sliding window to the peer nodes with different sizes according to the capabilities of the peer nodes in logical Actually the capability may be determined by the processing capability storage capability and network bandwidth Since each node may run a variety of services in cloud the remaining resources of each node may constantly change at different times Thus to measure the comprehensive capability of each peer node we try to run the query over multiple sampled uncertain data sets with different scales to evaluate the capability of each node in order to achieve the load balancing purpose As shown in Algorithm 1 we rst sample some uncertain datasets with different sizes to test the processing capability of each peer node which is measured by the processing rate Line 4 and then get the the average rates by computing the average values for several test times Line 5 Afterwards we can further obtain the overall average processing rates with Line 7 and thus we assign the sizes of the windows according to the overall capability weights with Lines 8 9

TABLE I Load Balance Evaluation  size of global sliding window  update granularity  and number of peer nodes are used in this experiment Table I gives the exclusive cpu time per update for updating the skyline computation of the 10 peer nodes As can be seen from the table the proposed algorithm can achieve good load balance among all the peer nodes in CPM and DPM In Algorithm 1 the monitor node divides the data fairly according to the capabilities of the peer nodes which contributes to the ideal query load balancing Since the streaming data is continuously arrived and sometimes a batch of items may arrive at a time thus we need to evaluate the performance with the number of the arrivals at a time To evaluate the effect of the numbers in our experiments we vary from 1 to  As shown in Fig 6 we can see that the time per update for two models increases as increases for both the synthetic and real data due to the time-consuming for the query updating for the larger number of arrivals Nevertheless we also nd that the time is not linearly increasing as the increase of  This is probably a consequence of that when is small the communication overhead increases due to the frequent data transmission whereas when is large the vast number of dominating tests increase the computation overhead Update granularity Furthermore as shown in Fig 6 we can nd that the performance of DPM is better than CPM which stems from that the computation of the skyline probabilities for the new arrivals is only occupied by a peer node in CPM while in DPM the tasks are executed by all peer nodes Thus the computation is improved especially in the cloud environment To be more obviously evaluate the models we choose 100 as the default value for the remaining tests Moreover from Fig 6 we can also see that the performances of CPM and DPM in two types of synthetic data are close this is probably the consequence of that we compute the dominating probabilities for new items and update the skyline probabilities based on the complete dominance tests in the models Therefore in the following experiments we only use Independent data to evaluate our proposals To evaluate the scalability of the models we test the performances of the models with different number of peer nodes From Fig 7\(a we can see that the time per update for continuous uncertain skyline queries in each model is reduced when the number of peer nodes increases from to  The results con“rm that the more peer nodes are adopted to parallelize the query the more improvement will be especially for the query over the large sliding window Therefore we believe that the proposed models are scalable Fig 7 Performance Peer number Moreover from Fig 7\(b we can see that the performance which is measured by the number of items updated per second is improved as the increase of the number of nodes Nevertheless the growths are relatively slowly compared with the growth rates of peer numbers The main reason is that the size of each local window decreases gradually with the increase node number thus the computational overhead on each node decreases whereas the communication overhead increases which affects the performance of the models To evaluate the adaptivity of the framework for the size of the global sliding window wevary from to  Moreover we assign the global window to local windows with equal sizes to achieve the goal of load balance as far as possible From the experiments we nd that framework can effectively process the queries even when the sliding window is large As shown in Fig 8 the overall time per update increases when we vary the size of global window from to  This is nature as that the larger size of the global window

Fig 8 Performance Window size is the more recent stream items that need to be maintained will be thus the computation overhead including the cost for updating the existing items and the cost for computing the skyline probabilities for new arrivals increases Furthermore as it is expected the performance of DPM is better than CPM due to the more parallelism for computing the skyline probabilities of the new arrivals V C ONCLUSION Nowadays parallel query processing over data streams has received considerable attention in academic and commercial areas but it poses an immense challenge to researchers In this paper we present a general framework GPS for parallel queries over data streams for distributed computing environments with high performance 22 especially for the cloud computing environments To the best of our knowledge it is the rst work to study the problem Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GPS is effective and practical As future work it is interesting and challenging to improve the framework in several aspects such as the index techniques and interface standardization of the framework Moreover we will test the performance of the framework for other queries such as uncertain topqueries and the queries over the graphical streaming data Additionally we are currently studying the fault-tolerant techniques for parallel query processing over uncertain data streams based on the proposed framework GPS A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by the National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China Grant No.2011CB302601 the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No.61379052 the National High Technology Research and Development 863 Program of China Grant No.2013AA01A213 the Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province Grant No.S2010J5050 Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education Grant No.20124307110015 R EFERENCES  C Aggarw al and P  Y u On inde xing high dimensional data with uncertainty in
