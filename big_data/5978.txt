Movie makers are not only want to know their movie's popularity based on the  from people who see the mo vies. If they hope that the movie is a 
box office hit, they should identify the correlations between audiences and reviews. Our visualization tools try to find the  relationships. Experiments on real dataset from a movie site naver movie.com\nd Korean Film Council containing the number of customers in each movie. We find some unique relations and discover the word of mouth effects from our results    I  I NTRODUCTION  With advanced internet and mobile en vironments audiences benefit from convenient and more efficient way of accessing information Nevertheless this pool of overloading data makes it more difficult to find what is meaningful to the audiences. Similarly since  
there are many movies in the wo rld it is hard for audiences to decide what a movie is the best for them They usually refer to the movie portal web sites to check other people\222s reviews or ratings and web portals  become one of the important factors in terms of getting profit for movie producers  A l s o   the rapid increase of social network, the information diffuses to others \(i.e. social friends very quickly [1, 4, 5   P e o p le te n d t o  b e liev e th a t m o r e  p o s i tiv e  ratings on a movie imply that the movie is good one  However sometimes it is true but not always S ome people manipulate the ratings intentionally in order to take users into their targeted movies or to decrease competitive movie\222s audiences 3   In the movie maker\222s view, they should be interested in 
knowing their movie is now getting positive reputations from reviews or ranking in the market because it is strongly related with their profits. Together with them, they may want to know the relations between ranking and reviewer\222s feedbacks ratings\. In the audience\222s view, th ey may want to know what a movie is really good or not. They also wish  to know the popularity of a movie come from huge advertisement or  reviewer\222s positive feedbacks  In our work, t o address these aspects, we identify  to make a visualization of movie ratings a nd ranking based on time series Clear visualization on huge user\222s data is important since compact abstraction or a large amount of information helps people decide proper choices Crawling  the online movie reviews data to recognize relationship between us ers 
and reviews Even if we tackle two aspects \(movie maker audience\, our main target is  movie d istributors \(i.e movie makers We explore  the  movie\222s audience patterns and influence the reviews on movie   T he main contributions in this paper are summarized  as follows   W e propose a visualization approach  to find clearly hidden relations between movies and their evaluation   Analyzing the patterns with reviews we find out influence  of the word of mouth effects  The rest of paper is organized as follow. In section II, we demonstrate our visualization approach and details the concept of user interface and visualization methods in section 
III. In section IV  we explain the implementation environments  t hen analyze th e findings. Finally, we conclude the paper and di scuss our future work in section V   II  V ISUALZATION APPROACH  Let assume one has a movie in the market, and he is the one of movie makers in the market. He can easily understand the success of the movie by monit oring the number of customers or the gross income from the box offices. However it is hard to know or compare what a movie is successful or not in the market if he has a bunch of movie information Also he may feel difficulties to analyze his marketing s trategy gets positive response from the reviewers. To address these challenges, we try to put all information on a screen  The information displayed on the screen is considered to s 
olve the following questions: \(i Can we know the effect of the movies is s uccessful or not ii What is a pattern betwe en profit and marketing cost? \(iii Is there a significant difference between domestic a nd overseas movies? \(iv Can we compare the several movies at a glance? Each question is implemented with the approaches o f visualization as the following ways  We display the total number of movie customers on the time axes. This approach will give users the clear identification of which movie is popular or not \(i.e., the success of the movies Together with the plotting we put a bar chart beside the customers plot. The bar chart will compare pre attentively which movie has the largest or the least number of customers In this approach, we give intuitive comp arison to any users addressing the question i 
  We assume that t he response from the marketing strategy can be estimated using the number of reviews from online movie review site. The more reviews mean more intensive and positive response to the marketing on a movie. To visualize market response, we propose two kinds of visualizations on the screen. First, we draw the line chart with normalized values from the number of customers and reviews  The difference between two values on each time point \(each day in our visualization\ has color coding with blue or red. The blue  color means that the normalized number of  customers is greater than that of the reviews otherwise we  give red color to the difference  The reason we differentiate the color is that a movie maker  will be happy \(blue\ if the number of customers  189 


are larger than reviews \(could be interpreted as marketing cost and response\. On the other hand, if the number of reviews are large but the number of customers are small, he may conclude that the customers does not enjoy his movie even the marke ting is vastly launched. To clearly identify the pattern we put visualization under the plots showing the difference from zero value  To compare the patterns between movies, we give an option that user can modify the monitoring time period. For example, e ach user may want to see the pattern for one week or one month since a movie has different customer pattern This option allows the users to easily navigate and explore the large dataset. This approach is addressing the question ii  stated above  To anal yze the differen ce  between any movies \(ex overseas vs. domestic movies\, we implement the user option to be able to select any movies from the dataset. This approach makes users easy to compare any movies. This approach can solve the question iii and iv   III  IMPLEMENTATION    F INDINGS  A  Dataset  We have crawled the movie dataset from a famous internet movie review site \(movie.naver.com\. We note that any other online movie site can be applied our approach  The dataset contains all user ids, movie ids, and rating s cores from Jan. 1, 2006 to Jul. 30, 2012. The dataset consists of 1,160,448 users, 13,129 movies, 3,047,960 ratings. Again, to a nalyze this size of data is non trivial   B  R elation between Users and Reviews  For easy explanation, we take 4 movies to show our findings First of all in Fig 1\(a most movies released within only one month and more than half of the total audiences watch the movie within 2 weeks. Movi e reviews have similar patterns compared to the  audiences These results are caused by the movie maker's marketing. Before releasing the movie a movie maker makes an attempt  to advertise their movie on TV, radio, internet etc. People who have been exposed to the adv ertising may watch the movie when the movie is released with high expectation. After watching the movie, if audiences satisfy that movie, they leave a good rating on the movie review site. Otherwise, they leave a bad rating or even they do not give rating score anymore    Second ly there are s ome patterns with audiences and reviews. At first, people watch the movie and then leave ratings. This phenomenon is repeated several times. It is shown that many people observe the movie review site's ratings and decide to whether watch the m ovie or not  If some movie has good reviews on many audiences, it is more likely to watch a movie than has bad reviews. Last but not least, we find villains who intentionally manipulate the reviews in order to deceive people to watch the movie they want. I n Fig 1 b  the 223PungSan Dog\224  shows such a situation. Even though only few people watch the movie, there are a lot of reviews on that movie with good ratings. After observing that reviews, many people watch that movie and they reco gnize this movie is not f un. These results can be identified by checking the changes of average ratings  IV  C ONCLUSION  Until now, we learn the patterns between movie audiences and reviews. Making graphs is in regard to the audiences and reviews by normalizing results which are meanin gful in terms of identifying and comparing the patterns. It is proved that there exists the word of mouth effects which an influence the movie's profit significantly Moreover we find that there are some correlations between audiences and reviews with recurring way. Our approach  could successfully demonstrate the existence phenomenon by interacting people and our system with simple visualization  For our future work, we do res earch on how to verify manipulated reviews   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the IT R&D Program of MKE/KEIT [10035708, "The development of CPS core technologies for high confidential autonomic control software      References  1  A Mislove, S.

A The Algorithm The primary idea of Algorithm 1 is to employ the threshold technique Algorithm 1 initially sets the threshold t to the minimum weight of edges lines 1  2 4  5 increases the threshold t in each round lines 4  5 and employs Procedure 1 to examine whether there is a feasible assignment of DNs to VMs under the threshold t lines 6  8 If Procedure 1 can make an assignment of DNs to VMs as the threshold t is not greater than the maximum weight of edges Algorithm 1 outputs the assignment made by Procedure 1 lines 6  8 otherwise Algorithm 1 outputs no feasible solution line 10  Algorithm 1 3 Approximation Algorithm for VMPDN Input A graph G  D  V E  with weights d ab associated with all e ab  E 1 Index all edges in E in a nondecreasing order of the weights 2 m  0  3 while m  E  do 4 m  m 1  5 t  the weight of the edge with index m  6 if Procedure 1 with input parameters G  t  and the constraints of 3tVMPDN i.e constraints in 3a  3e outputs an assignment A then 7 Return the assignment A  8 end if 9 end while 10 Return no feasible solution Subsequently we design an algorithm to solve VMPDN with a xed threshold t tVMPDN For readability tVMPDN is formulated as the following integer program subject to  j  V x ij 1   i  D 2a  i  D x ij  1   j  V 2b x ij  t  d ij   0   i  D  j  V 2c   i  D x ij 1    i  D x ij 2   t  d j 1 j 2   0   j 1 j 2  V j 1   j 2 2d x ij  0  1    i  D  j  V 2e We undertake the design of an LP rounding algorithm for tVMPDN Note that because tVMPDN has quadratic constraints in 2d we cannot get an LP solution for tVMPDN using an LP algorithm Thus we need to remove constraints in 2d while ensuring that P1 any feasible solution of tVMPDN is a feasible solution of the new problem and P2 the maximum access latency is bounded in the new problem Observe that if we directly remove constraints in 2d from tVMPDN the access latency between any two assigned VMs cannot be bounded Thus we need to add new constraints to ensure that properties P1 and P2 are satis“ed Note that the access latency satis“es the triangle inequality thus the access latency between any two assigned VMs must be bounded by 3 t if new constraints that is the access latency between an arbitrary assigned VM and an arbitrary DN is bounded by 2 t  are added On the other hand in tVMPDN because both the access latency between any two assigned VMs and the access latency between an arbitrary DN and its assigned VM are bounded by t  the access latency between an arbitrary assigned VM and an arbitrary DN is bounded by 2 t  In other words any feasible solution of tVMPDN satis“es the newly added constraints This implies that any feasible solution of tVMPDN is a feasible solution of the new problem termed 3tVMPDN obtained from tVMPDN by replacing constraints in 2d with constraints in 3d The integer program of 3tVMPDN is described as follows subject to  j  V x ij 1   i  D 3a  i  D x ij  1   j  V 3b x ij  t  d ij   0   i  D  j  V 3c   i  D x ij  2 t  d ij   0   i  D  j  V 3d x ij  0  1    i  D  j  V 3e Procedure 1 LP Rounding Input A graph G  D  V E  with weights d ab associated with all e ab  E  a threshold t  and constraints of a problem 11 Get the LP relaxation of the input problem by relaxing the input constraints x ij  0  1  to x ij  0  1  12 Get a feasible LP solution x  for the LP relaxation of the input problem using an LP solver 13 if no feasible LP solution exists then 14 Return no feasible solution 15 end if 16 Construct a bipartite graph G   D   V  E   by Procedure 2 with input parameters G and x   17 Find a matching M to saturate all nodes i  D  in G  using an algorithm for BMP 18 for each edge between nodes i and j in the matching M do 19 Assign DN i to VM j  20 end for 21 Return the assignment Procedure 1 is an LP rounding algorithm that is used to nd a feasible solution of 3tVMPDN as the constraints of 3tVMPDN are input to Procedure 1 First the integer program formulation of 3tVMPDN is changed to the linear program formulation by relaxing constraints in 3e to x ij  0  1 line 11 Subsequently a feasible LP solution x  for the LP relaxation of 3tVMPDN is obtained by an LP solver line 12 After x  is obtained we nd a feasible solution of 3tVMPDN based on Theorem 2 We rst use x  to construct a bipartite graph G   D   V  E    where D   D  V    j   i  D x  ij  0   and E    e ij  x  ij  0  by Procedure 2 line 16 Observe that  j  V x  ij 1 for each i  D and  i  D x  ij  1 for each IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications 1305

DN c3 the access latency between any DN and its assigned VM is not greater than t  and c4 the access latency between an arbitrary assigned VM and an arbitrary DN is not greater than 2 t  First note that each DN i  D  is assigned to a single VM and each VM j  V  is assigned to at most one DN since DN i  D  is assigned to VM j  V  if and only if e ij is in the matching M lines 18  20 and the matching M saturates all nodes in D  line 17 This implies c1 and c2 because D   D and V    j   i  D x  ij  0  V lines 22  29 In addition x  is an LP solution for the LP relaxation of 3tVMPDN line 12 x  must satisfy constraints in 3c and 3d If DN i is assigned to VM j  e ij is in M  E  lines 18  20 This implies x  ij  0 lines 30  34 According to constraints in 3c we have d ij  t  Thus c3 holds Besides consider an arbitrary DN i and an arbitrary assigned VM j  Then j  V   otherwise VM j cannot be assigned to any DN This implies  i  D x  ij  0 lines 25  29 According to constraints in 3d we have d ij  2 t  Hence we have c4 Lemma 2 The maximum access latency in any feasible solution of 3tVMPDN under the threshold t is at most 3 t  Proof Let assignment A be an arbitrary feasible solution of 3tVMPDN under the threshold t  Because the assignment A satis“es constraints in 3c the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM in the assignment A is not greater than t  It suf“ces to show the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs in the assignment A is not greater than 3 t  Consider two arbitrary assigned VMs j and k  Let VM j be assigned to DN i in the assignment A  Then the access latency between VMs j and k is not greater than the access latency between VM j and DN i  L 1  plus the access latency between DN i and VM k  L 2  because the access latency satis“es the triangle inequality Since the assignment A satis“es constraints in 3c and 3d L 1  t and L 2  2 t  completing the proof Lemma 3 Any feasible solution of tVMPDN is a feasible solution of 3tVMPDN Proof Let assignment A be an arbitrary feasible solution of tVMPDN Then the assignment A must satisfy constraints in 2a 2b 2c 2d and 2e Since constraints in 2a 2b 2c and 2e are equal to constraints in 3a 3b 3c and 3e respectively We need only to show the assignment A satis“es constraints in 3d It suf“ces to show that in the assignment A  the access latency between an arbitrary assigned VM j and an arbitrary DN i is at most 2 t  Let DN i be assigned to VM k in the assignment A If VM k is VM j  the access latency between DN i and VM j is at most t because the assignment A satis“es constraints in 2c otherwise the access latency between DN i and VM j is not greater than the access latency between DN i and VM k  L 1  plus the access latency between VM k and VM j  L 2  because the access latency satis“es the triangle inequality Because the assignment A satis“es constraints in 2c and 2d L 1  t and L 2  t  completing the proof Lemma 4 Procedure 1 is a polynomial-time algorithm Proof Clearly in polynomial time a bipartite graph can be constructed by Procedure 2 line 16 and an assignment of DNs to VMs can be made lines 18  20 Besides in polynomial time a matching in a bipartite graph can be found line 17 and a feasible LP solution x  for the LP relaxation of the input problem can be obtained by a polynomial-time LP algorithm line 12 Thus Procedure 1 can be executed in polynomial time Theorem 4 Algorithm 1 is a 3 approximation algorithm of VMPDN Proof Algorithm 1 executes Procedure 1 at most  E  times Since Procedure 1 can be executed in polynomial time by Lemma 4 Algorithm 1 can be executed in polynomial time Let d OP T be the maximum access latency in the optimal solution of VMPDN We need to show Algorithm 1 can always output an assignment of DNs to VMs with the maximum access latency of at most 3  d OP T  Clearly there is an edge in the input graph G of Algorithm 1 such that d OP T is equal to the weight of the edge In addition t is increased from the smallest to the greatest weight of the edges in G By Theorem 3 and Lemma 2 the maximum access latency in any assignment output by Procedure 1 is smaller than 3  d OP T as t<d OP T  Thus it suf“ces to show that c1 Procedure 1 must output a feasible solution of 3tVMPDN as t  d OP T  Since d OP T is the maximum access latency in the optimal solution of VMPDN there is a feasible solution of tVMPDN as t  d OP T  By Lemma 3 there is a feasible solution of 3tVMPDN as t  d OP T  Thus by Theorem 3 c1 must hold IV O PTIMAL A PPROXIMATION A LGORITHM Theorem 1 indicates that an approximation algorithm with a factor smaller than two does not exist for VMPDN Here we propose a 2-approximation algorithm that is an optimal approximation algorithm for VMPDN The basic idea is to divide the original problem into  V  small problems compute a solution for each small problem and subsequently choose the best solution The steps are described in the following paragraphs First we divide VMPDN into  V  small problems Each small problem is a rooted version of VMPDN termed rVMPDN In other words in rVMPDN the set of the assigned VMs must contain a speci“c VM r  Clearly an algorithm for rVMPDN can be used to solve VMPDN by trying all possible  V  roots The mixed integer program of rVMPDN can be obtained from that of VMPDN by adding new constraints  i  D x ir 1  Then we

Theorem 5 Algorithm 2 is a 2-approximation algorithm for VMPDN Speci“cally Algorithm 2 is an optimal approximation algorithm for VMPDN V T HE P ROBLEM V ARIANT We study the variation of VMPDN termed sVMPDN which is also introduced and shown not to admit any approximation algorithm with a factor smaller than two in The objecti v e of sVMPDN is to minimize the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM while ensuring that the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs maximum inter-VM latency is bounded by a speci“c value s  In other words sVMPDN bounds the maximum interVM latency at a speci“c value s  rather than minimizing it We can obtain the mixed integer program of sVMPDN from that of VMPDN by replacing constraints in 1e with   i  D x ij 1    i  D x ij 2   s  d j 1 j 2   0   j 1 j 2  V j 1   j 2  Similar to the design of the 2-approximation algorithm for VMPDN we introduce a new problem termed tr2sVMPDN with the integer program described in the following subject to  j  V x ij 1   i  D 5a  i  D x ij  1   j  V 5b x ij  t  d ij   0   i  D  j  V 5c   i  D x ij   s  d rj   0   j  V 5d  i  D x ir 1 5e x ij  0  1    i  D  j  V 5f Using a similar argument for sketching the proof of Theorem 5 as the constraints of tr2sVMPDN i.e constraints in 5a  5f instead of the constraints of 2trVMPDN are input to Procedure 1 Algorithm 2 can always output an assignment where the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM is not greater than t due to constraints in 5c and the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs is not greater than 2 s because the maximum access latency between VM r and any assigned VM is not greater than s due to constraints in 5d Thus with a slight modi“cation Algorithm 2 can obtain an optimal solution of sVMPDN through a violation of the maximum inter-VM latency constraint by a factor of at most two as described in Theorem 6 The proof of Theorem 6 is omitted due to its similarity with those of Theorems 4 and 5 Theorem 6 Algorithm 2 is a 1  2 approximation algorithm for sVMPDN if the constraints of tr2sVMPDN instead of the constraints of 2trVMPDN are input to Procedure 1 VI N

respectively To study the impact of the distribution of DNs and VMs on the performance of the proposed algorithms DNs and VMs are assigned to one of the rst 16 racks 64 racks 256 racks and 1,024 racks The access latency between a DN or VM and a VM is randomly chosen from the interval 0  9  1  1 times the estimated access latency between them The estimated access latency between a DN or VM and a VM is evaluated by the sum of the switch delay and the physical link delay The def ault size of a TCP pack et is 1,500 bytes Assume that the link bandwidth is 10Gbps Then the switch delay of transferring a TCP packet is approximately 1.214  s In addition between the node DN or VM and the access switch between the access switch and the aggregate switch and between the aggregate switch and the core switch the link lengths are approximately 10 m 25 m and 25 m respectively according to and thus the physical link delay of transferring a TCP packet is approximately 1.207  s 1.283  s and 1.283  s respectively according to 10 We evaluate the performance of Algorithms 1 and 2 on the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM and all pairs of assigned VMs In addition we compare our algorithms with the lower bound of the optimal solution  LB  evaluated by the smallest threshold t such that a feasible LP solution for the LP relaxation of 2trVMPDN can be obtained by Procedure 1 The empirical data is obtained by averaging the data of 100 assignment of racks to DNs and VMs for each network topology In addition we also evaluate the worst maximum ratios of the maximum access latencies of Algorithms 1 and 2 to LB among 100 assignment of racks to DNs and VMs Fig 3 shows that Algorithm 1 performs as well as Algorithm 2 in terms of the maximum access latency in almost all cases and that the maximum access latencies of Algorithms 1 and 2 approach LB  In addition broadly speaking as the rack range increases the maximum access latencies of Algorithms 1 and 2 tend to increase in all network architectures Speci“cally both Algorithms 1 and 2 have approximately the same maximum access latency as the rack range is 1  64 and 1  256 in Tree 1  64  1  256  and 1

factor equal to the known lower bound In the authors ar gue that the data locality may not be relevant anymore because with 100G or more adapters the performance bottleneck will be at the disk I/O rather than the network interface However unless we can avoid the oversubscription on the link capacities in the network inside a data center the network bottleneck can cause high access latency for remote data Moreover some researchers suggest that disks be replaced with ash memory or even DRAM as the primary storage in the future In such en vironments the performance bottleneck of data access could reemerge in the network interface and an ef“cient VM placement algorithm continues to be required for minimizing the access latency between data and computation nodes VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we investigated the placement problem of VMs for DNs termed VMPDN and its variant termed sVMPDN which are initially introduced and shown not to admit any approximation algorithm with a factor smaller than two in  VMPDN asks for the assignment of DNs to VMs with the minimum maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM and among all pairs of assigned VMs such that each DN is assigned to a single VM and each VM is not assigned to more than one DN In sVMPDN the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM is minimized while ensuring that the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs maximum inter-VM latency is bounded To the best of our knowledge no approximation algorithms have been proposed for VMPDN and sVMPDN in the literature so far We initially proposed a 3-approximation algorithm Algorithm 1 and subsequently proposed a 2-approximation algorithm Algorithm 2 that is an optimal approximation algorithm for VMPDN in the price of higher time complexity Furthermore we also showed that with a slight modi“cation Algorithm 2 can become a 1  2 approximation algorithm for sVMPDN In other words Algorithm 2 can be slightly modi“ed for obtaining an optimal solution of sVMPDN through a violation of the maximum inter-VM latency constraint by a factor of at most two We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of Algorithms 1 and 2 based on four network architectures inside a data center including Tree VL2 Fat-Tree and BCube discussed in The simulation results sho wed that both Algorithms 1 and 2 make approximately optimal assignments of DNs to VMs In addition the simulation results also showed that although Algorithm 1 has a worse approximation factor Algorithm 1 performs as well as Algorithm 2 in terms of the maximum access latency in almost all cases R EFERENCES  Applying the cloud to big data storage Online A v ailable
