Ensemble Method for Classification of High Dimensional Data    Yongjun Piao, Hyun Woo Park, Cheng Hao Jin  Dept. of Computer Science  Chungbuk National U niversity  Cheongju South Korea  Emali pyz, hwpark, kimsungho  dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr  Keun Ho Ryu  Dept. of  Electrical and Computer Engineering  Chungbuk National University  Cheongju, South Korea  Email: khryu@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr   Abstract 227  Ensemble methods, also known as classifier combination were often used to improve the performance of classification Grow ing problem of data dimensionality  makes  a various  challenge s  
for supervised learning   Generally used classification methods such as decision tree, neural network and support  vector machines  were difficult to be directly appl ied  on high dimensional  dataset s I n this paper  we proposed an ensemble method for classification of high dimensional data with each classifier constructed from a different set of features determined by partition of redundant  features In our method the redundancy  of features was con sidered to divide the original feature space  Then each generated feature subset was  trained by support vector machine 
 and the results of each classifier were combined by the majority voting method The efficiency and effectiveness of our method were demo nstrated through comparisons with other ensemble techniques, and the results showed that our method outperformed other methods  Keywords 227 classification  ensemble  feature redundancy  high dimensional data   I   I NTRODUCTION  The ultimate goal of supervised lear ning is to achieve the  best possible classification pe rformance for the task at hand  1  C lassification algorithm  is  presented with a set  of  records   where  each 
record  is  described  by a fixed number  of  features along with a class label  that  denotes its ta rget   The  algorithm then outputs a concept  description that  represents underlying  patterns  in  the  data  Several classification algorithms have been developed such as decision tree  2 neural network  3  and support  vector machine  SVM 4  and so on  How ever, the increasing of the dimensionality may cause several problems to these classification algorithms with respect to scalab ility and learning performance. Moreover, the classification ability of a single 
classifier  is limited  In general, the ensembles  of classifiers provide better classification accuracy than a single predictor produced Ensemble methods, also known as classifier  combination  generate  a set of base classifiers from training data and perform classification by combining the results of ea ch base classifier In order to improve the accuracy of multiple classifiers, each base classifier should be diverse and independent. Ensemble classifier generation methods can be broadly categorized into four groups 5   th at ar e b as e d  o n i  m an ip u lat io n o f the training set, ii\ manipulation of the input features, iii\ manipulation of the class labels, iv\ manipula tion of the learning algorithm  Bagging 6  a n d b oo s t i n g  7  ar e th e  w id ely  u s ed en s em b le  methods. They resample the original data to create mult 
iple training sets based on some sampling distribution and build the basic classifi er from each bootstrap samples  However, these methods cannot guarantee to generate fully independen t individual base classifier 8   T h eo r etic al an d  em p ir i ca l r esu lts   9    10  in d ic ate th at th e m o s t ef f ec tiv e m eth o d  o f a ch iev i n g  the independence is by training the base classifiers on different feature subsets 11    T h e  b a s ic i d ea o f f ea tu r e s u b s et based ensemble is simply to give each classifier a different projection of th e training  set [1 2   Compared with manipulating the training samples for base classifier construction, using independent feature subset for ensemble generation seems to be more efficient f or the high dimensional data [1 3   T h e r ea s o n  is  that i\ feature sub 
set based ensemble can perform fast due to the reduced size of input space; ii\ it can reduce the correlations among the classifiers  In this paper, we proposed a n ensemble framework  for classifying high dimensional  data  with each classifier constructed fr om a different set of features determined by partition of redundant features First, we suggested a multiple subsets generation methods based on the feature relevance and redundancy to construct each of the classifier. Then, a number of classifiers learned  from the generated subsets. Finally, the classification results of each classifier were combined by the majority voting It was observed that the proposed ensemble method obtained promising classification accuracy compared with other ensemble methods  II 
 P RO POSED E NSEMBLE M ETHOD  An ensemble method with multiple independent feature  subsets is proposed to classify high dimensional data   The framework of the proposed ensemble is shown in Fig. 1. The proposed method broadly  consist s of two steps i\ Generation of  multiple feature  subsets based on the correlations among features ii\ Learning of the model from each feature  subset using machine learning algorithm as base classifier  and c ombination of the results of each classifier by majority voting  Next, we will i llustrate each step in detail  245

Th e number of features  is 12 582  The prostate dataset was first published in  23 it is a two class classification problem and contains 102 samples and 12 600 genes. One of the tasks addressed by the authors is to build a model that can discriminate between normal prostate and tumorous prostate tissue  TABLE I  D ATASETS USED IN OUR EXPERIMENS  Dataset  I nstances  Features  Classes  Leukemia  72  12,582  3  Prostate  102  12,600  2   B  Performance Evaluation  We compared our methods with widely used ensemble methods Baggi ng, AdaBo ost and Random forest. For bagging adaboost and our methods, SVM was used as the base classifier  for fair comparison The number of classifiers for each ensemble methods was set to 20 To obtain a statistically reliable  predictive measurement, we per forme d 10 runs of 10 fold cross validation on all the datasets. In 10 fold cross validation, each dataset was randomly partitioned into ten  parts Nine parts were used as the training set, and the remaining one was used as the testing dataset  Selecting the ker nel and appropriate parameters plays an important role in SVM classification performance. The RBF kernel is a commonly used kernel for three reasons  First, the RBF kernel can handle nonlinear relationships between class labels and attributes. Second  it has fewer hyperparameters that influence the complexity of the model selection than the Polynomial kernel. Third, the RBF kernel ha s fewer numerical difficulties  In our experiments, we chose the RBF kern el function and the parameters  c and r must be o ptimized for the RBF kernel for each dataset. T o determine the best values of c and r we conducted a grid search approach using 10 fold cross val idation. A number of pairs of c   r values were attempted and the pair with the best accuracy was picked in the range of  2     2   2 c 15 3 5                                         C OMEPARSION OF CLASSI FICATION ACCURACY  ON MLL _ LEUKEMIA DATASET    Runs  Bagging  AdaBoost  Random  Forest  Proposed Method  1  95.83  97.22  81.94  98.61  2  94.44  97.22  80.56  100  3  95.83  97.22  80.56  98.61  4  95.83  97.22  81.94  98.61  5  91.67  95.83  79.17  98.61  6  94.44  97.22  86.11  98.61  7  94.44  97.22  87.5  98.61  8  93 06  95.83  80.56  98.61  9  93.06  97.22  83.33  98.61  10  94.44  95.83  79.17  98.61  A vg  94.30  96.80  82.0 8  98.7 5  a  Each row indicates accuracy of each run and the last row represents average accuracy of ten runs    TABLE III  C OMEPARSION OF CLASSI FICATION ACCURACY ON  PROSTATE  DATASET    Runs  Bagging  AdaBoost  Random Forest  Proposed Method  1  91.18  91.18  80.39  95.1  2  92.16  92.16  82.35  95.1  3  93.14  92.16  78.43  95.1  4  91.18  89.22  83.33  94.12  5  91.18  91.18  77.45  94.12  6  92.16  92.16  85.3  93.14  7  91.18  91.18  86.27  95.1  8  92.1 6  91.18  80.39  96.08  9  93.14  92.16  75.49  95.1  10  91.18  91.18  76.47  95.1  A vg  91.8 7  91.3 8  80.5 9  94.8 1  b  Each row indicates accuracy of each run and the last row represents average accuracy of ten runs   247
