Self M2M based Wearable Watch Platform for Collecting Personal Activity in Real-time Ki Eun Seong College of IT Engineering Kyungpook National University Daegu, Korea suriko@naver.com Kyung Chun Lee College of IT Engineering Kyungpook National University Daegu, Korea kc_lee@ee.knu.ac.kr Soon Ju Kang College of IT Engineering Kyungpook National University Daegu, Korea sjkang@ee.knu.ac.kr Abstract 227 Tracking and monitoring the history of personal 
activities by using wearable device can be applied in various different ways. For example, by analyzing the personal activities can be used to diagnose the symptoms of certain illness such as Parkinson\222s disease. The activity data can also tell the severity of the user\222s chronic illness. In this paper, we propose the watch platform which keeps the record of the user\222s activity data. This activity history is collected automatically inside the user\222s watch through peer-to-peer direct communicating with other devices. In order to implement self-awareness and the opportunistic computing manner in the watch platform, some advanced concepts such as ultra-low power consumption schemes and peer 
to-peer direct communication between watch and external devices are included. On the proposed platform, we have implemented a prototype watch as a test bed for our software platform and also measured the several performance including power consumption rate and the computing opportunity of the prototype Keywords\227 wearable device, sm art watch, watch platform M2M, personal activity recording, activity tracking I I NTRODUCTION Wearable devices can analyze the user\222s personal activity for prolonged time, and this activity or informative patterns can 
be applied in various ways. For example, when the user who has turned on the gas oven leaves the house, the watch automatically detects the situation and alerts the warning message to the user in real-time. Also by analyzing the activity pattern of a person who is suffering from Parkinson\222s disease can diagnose the symptom and severity of the illness. Wearable device is appropriate for collecting and analyzing the user\222s activity which can be reformed into more useful information Most of the recent watch-type devices are focused on SMS service, remote control of the smartphone and analyzing movements using internal accelerometer. Current watch 
platforms do not support the functions for assessing and analyzing personal activities in terms of software and hardware structure. That is because, th e existing watches require paring step to communicate with exte rnal devices. There are many difficulties in terms of speed and user interaction In order to collect personal activity data and analyze them the watch needs to have specific functions. These functions are understanding the user\222s condition, predicting the behavior and ID-exchanging between the devices through the direct communication. In addition, the low-power schemes are essential to ensure long operating time because a wearable device has a limited battery capac ity. At last, because user\222s consistent intervention for operating the watch is inconvenient 
in user\222s perspective, making the implicit HCI\(HumanComputer Interaction\s an important factor In this paper, we propose architecture of the watch-type wearable devices for assessment and analysis of the user\222s activity for diverse services. This platform includes many functions to implement features mentioned above. In addition it is based on opportunistic computi t o i n crease user  convenience and realize low-power system. The watch will be able to provide useful services to elderly or people with disability as well as general users Regarding the organization of this paper, section 2 explains related works about wearable devices and section 3 represents the purpose of the platform through service scenario using the 
platform. Section 4 shows the pr oposed architecture and core functions. Section 5 and 6 explains the usefulness of the platform through implementing th e service scenario and energy efficiency. In the last section we summarize the platform and explain future works II R EALATED W ORKS Various types of wearable devices such as glasses, shoes and watch have been developed and sold. Among these devices especially a wide variety of wa tch-type wearable devices are being sold by different manufacturers. The most representative products are Pebble Watch[2 and Sm art W a tch[3 by SONY  Especially Pebble is a watch developed by social funding and it 
provides services such as SM S, music control and gesture recognition through communicating with smartphone or tablet Also because the watch provides SDK to developer, it can be used to develop different kind of services Other than the wearable devi ce that focus on interacting with a smart device, a variety of platform are developed to This work was supported by the IT R&D program of MSIP/KEIT 10041145, Self-Organized Software pl atform\(SoSp\ for Welfare Devices   286 


recognize behavior and give alarm. Unlike the existing devices that recognize user\222s behavior by accelerometers, eW a platform inferring the user\222s location  by using microphone and light sensor. In addition, there are devices for detecting the falls[5 a n d s e n d i n g p a t i e n t o r e l d e r l y 222s c o n d i t i o n s t o e x t e r n a l  devi  III P ROPOSED S ERVICE S CENARIO AND D ESIGN C ONSIDERATIONS a Fig. 1 Self M2M based watch service scen ario as a personal activity black box Fig.1 is a service scenario that shows the process of collecting user\222s various activities using the watch and sending the activities to a smartphone. Detailed procedure is as following. A user wearing the watch presses the digital door lock button to enter the house. After pressing the door lock button, door lock wakes the watch which is in the sleep mode and checks the user\222s ID. If the ID is the registered user, door lock opens the door and sends th e arrival activity to the watch After the user passes the front door, the watch wakes up periodically and exposes its presence by sending its ID to a stationary node. Through this process, the watch in the living room receives its location info rmation from st ationary node and saves them. After this step, user measures his/her weight and the watch receives the act ivity from the body scale Medication alert message which is sent by smart pill reminder is shown on the watch\222s display The user reads this message and moves to the bed room from living room in order to take the medicine. At this time, changed location data is sent to user\222s watch from stationary node and saved in the watch After the user who moves to the smart pill reminder presses the button, the pill reminder discharges the medicine and sends the medication completion message after confirming the user\222s ID The user who completed taking a medication moves to the front door and opens it to go out and then watch receives activity data similar to as in the case of return. Finally, the user can send off all activity data kept inside the watch to a smartphone in order to see or share the data In above service scenario, any command or setting had not been applied to the watch by user in order to activate the process of activity accumulation The user can collect the activity data just by wearing a watch and associating his/her daily life. This is possible because of the watch\222s tasks which can communicate with peripherals \(ex - door lock, body scale and pill reminder\and can recognize the user\222s location that are performed autonomously depending on the situation. The watch platform includes the operating structure and functions that autonomously performs the periodic and non-periodic tasks according to the use r\222s current situation The followings are design cons iderations to implement the watch platform Direct communications between the devices and opportunistic computing architecture Priority-based preemptive multi-tasking Location-aware and asynchronous message delivery protocols Low-power schemes for wearable device IV T HE P ROPSED W ATCH P LATFORM A RCHITECTURE The following is the software architecture for the proposed watch platform b Fig. 2 Watch platform\222s software architecture The proposed software platform in this paper includes essential functions such as direct communication between devices that can accumulate the user\222s activity data and connect with the smartphone. Also th e platform concentrates on minimizing the user\222s interventions. This will help users who have less knowledge about IT devices to easily control the watch. Fig. 2 shows the watch platform\222s software architecture which contains these features The proposed watch platform is divided into three main layer. The lowest level, OS layer, is composed of RTOS kernel and BSP\(Board Support Package\he middle level, system layer, provides the core and managing functions. The highest level, applications layer, is layer that provides a services directly to the user 287 


A OS Layer - Ubinos as a resource constrained RTOS In the watch platform, multiple functions such as communicating with external de vices, alerting the user with important information and sensing the movement with accelerometer gyro sensors are performed at the concurrent time. In this environment where multiple tasks are performed concurrently, firmware level software or event-driven OS are not suitable to control the system. Therefore, RTOS which supports a variety of real-time functions by multitasking should be used to guarantee reliable system operation. We use RTOS that is developed in our lab called UBINOS in order to meet these conditions. Ubinos supports priority-based preemptive multitasking and rich inter-task communications B e c a u s e  of these reasons, Ubinos is suitable for wearable devices B System Manager Layer System manager handles the overall resource of the watch platform and system control. There are four main managers in the watch platform. Each managers are described below UI Manager - In this watch platform, user can control the system by using two buttons. UI manager displays the different types of appli cation that you can select and allows the selection of application BLE Manager - Bluetooth low energy module is used to communicate with external devices. BLE manager controls this BLE status and communication functions Module Manager - Watch platform allows connection with other sensor modules through the external port Module manager distinguishes the type of the module and according to the module selects the pre-defined protocol which is used to send and receive the data Power Manager - In wearable devices, power management is a very impor tant function because the wearable system has a limited battery capacity Because of this, the watch platform provides lowpower schemes to increase the energy efficiency. The schemes decreases the power consumption by operating the system as a low-power mode when the idle task is being performed C M2M Manager Layer 1 PNIP\(Proximity based Neighbor Identification Protocol In the proposed service scenario of the section 3, there are an ID authentication process to enter the house and also data transferring process when measuring user\222s weight and sending the data to the watch. If you implement these process by using RF module alone, RF module should be always turned on or needs to be turned on by a user whenever the function is required. The former case will increase the system\222s power consumption and the latter case may cause inco nvenience and hassle of operation. To solve this problems, watch platform has a protocol called PNIP. The PNIP is a communication protocol to wake the adjacent devices a nd exchange their ID when the data transmission is needed The most important part for implementing the PNIP is how to wake the system in sleep mode wirelessly. To implement this, we use LF\(Low Frequency\ module as well as the BLE module. The LF module generates interrupt signal by detecting the predefined pattern signal. By using this LF module and transceiver which generates the signal, system wakes up and starts to exchange the data. If you use this protocol, you can reduce the power consumption and user intervention. Fig. 3 shows the sequence diagram of the PNIP c Fig. 3 Sequence diagram of the PNIP 2 LIDx & AMD\(Location-Aware and Asychronous Message Delivery Protocol LIDx is an indoor location-aware protocol  I n t h i s  protocol, stationary node is placed in every unit space\(exbedroom, living room, kitchen\d it estimates the location of the watch by comparing the strength of the RF signal. Each stationary node is connected to physical network and they make an overlay network. Through this overlay network stationary nodes share location of the watch and if this location changes, it sends the location info to the watch from a stationary node. AMD is a protocol that signifies the way to send an asynchronous message among the devices which are in the same network Thi s prot oc ol i s used f o r sen d i ng a medication alert message to user in proposed service scenario In this platform, we use th is location-aware and message delivery protocol to precisely id entify the user\222s lifestyle and activity D Application Layer Application layer consists of services that are provided by watch platform. Four main services are provided by a platform and a variety of services will be added to a platform by expansion of the service scenario Each service consists of one or more tasks and they are developed to work independently to the system. The following explains the four basic applications which are provided by the watch platform Activity App - Activity app accumulates the user\222s activity data and sends the data to external devices or smart devices when the tran sfer is requested. The activities include user\222s health data such as weight blood glucose and pressure as well as indoor location information and outdoor exercise info 288 


Scheduler App - This application receives the user\222s schedule info from smart devices and shows an alarm message according to schedule time External App - Watch platform can communicate with various external sensor module through the external port by wire. External app receives and saves the data which are sent by the sensor module through the module manager Physical Activity Recognition \(PAR\ App - This application is used to reco gnize the user\222s gestures or movements. This app can work as a motion controller for the watch\222s certain function or external devices through communication V A PPLICATION OF A CTIVITY H ISTORY The following describes the diverse usage of activity data that is collected through communicating with external devices Activity accumulating service is useful for patients who have a chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. This service allows the users to see their trend of health info and life pattern. This history information can be used as a stepping stone to improve the symptoms. We implement the service scenario wh ich is proposed in section 3 and then fig. 4 shows the results. Fig. 4\(a\splays actual activities which are accumulated by watch. Fig. 4\(b health data such as weight, blood glucose and blood pressure d Fig. 4 User\222s activities \(a\ Service scen ario data \(b\ Health info Activity reminding service indicates a specific action to user and give an alert message according to the schedule. To send a medication alert message in proposed service scenario is a representative example. Fig. 5 shows the detailed process of medication alert service In medication reminding scenario, pill reminder send a medication alert message to stationary node by AMD Stationary node searches a receiving device which is in network and send the message to that device. The medication alert message is displayed on the watch\222s display after it receives the message. After the user receives the message invalid user tries to take a medication. But the pill reminder does not discharge medicine because reminder certifies her ID by PNIP. When the valid user tries to take the medicine it is e Fig. 5 Representative example of the activity reminding\(medication reminding xample of a figure caption discharged. Fig. 6 \(a\hows the actual medication alert message which is sent by pill reminder. There is other reminding service which is alerted by using the activity that is collected by the watch. When the user tries to leave the house the activity history is examined and if certain activity is missing such as turning off the gas stove after turning it on, the watch alarms the user. Figure \(b\shows this alert message f Fig. 6 Reminding message \(a\on reminding \(b\gnition reminding Fig 7 shows the name exchanging service using human motions. This service is activat ed by human motion such as waving or shaking hands when two people meets. The identity data of the person is recorded and can be used to inform the user whom he/she met plus a doctor can use this identity history as a medical parameter to test the patient\222s memory status by asking the user who he/she met g Fig. 7 Motion triggered identiy exchange service VI P OWER P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION Wearable devices have a short operating time due to limited battery capacity, whereas a variety of functions are provided Because of that, power manageme nt is an essential function 289 


Because our platform provides low-power schemes, it is possible to increase energy efficiency h Fig. 8 Consumption of the current in vari ous state of the watch \(a\ Idle watch\ \(b\ PNIP with resource device \(c\ Indoor locationing\(LIDx\ \(d Outdoor exercise Fig. 8 shows the graph of the current consumption in various state of the watch. As you can see the consumption of the current is increased at arising of computing and is minimized during the rest period. Table 1 shows the current value at each states TABLE I C URRENT V ALUE IN EACH STATE State mA Avg No power Management 28.75mA 28.75 28.75mA Idle\(watch 110.62 2.38 114.23uA PNIP 114.33 28.12 1.25mA LIDx 109.78 26.51 242.72uA Sencing 403.50 13.83 1.04mA As seen in table 1, average current value of the no power management state is 28.75mA. By comparing this data with other state\222s average value, we can see that current consumption is saved more than 95%\(idle\up to 99%\(PNIP VII C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE WORKS In this paper, we have proposed software and hardware architecture of the watch-type wearable device to keep track and analyze the user\222s activity of various actions. Also many kinds of reminding services based on the record of the personal activity are provided by this platform. To implement the activity-tracking services and low power consumption, the platform requires various functions such as PINP and LIDx AMD. The PNIP is a communication protocol to wake the adjacent devices and exchange their ID. LIDx&AMD is a location-awareness and asynch ronous message delivery protocol. Not only the communication protocol, but also low power schemes are provided by the platform in order to increase energy efficiency We have proposed the servi ce scenario that shows the process of self-collecting the user\222s various activities and sending the activities to the smartphone. In addition, we implemented the activity-re minding services such as medication and fire alert. By us ing this scenario, a specific activity is guided for the user By measuring the consumption of the current in each state of the watch, we found out that the watch operates using minimal consumption of power Tracking and analyzing the user\222s activities can be used for various services further than the application mentioned above If the analysis of the user\222s precise behavior or motion info is available, then more accurate pattern of daily life can be brought about. Through that, mo re advanced services with similar functions can be provided to users R EFERENCES 1 Conti, M., & Kumar, M. 2010.

in combination reaction wheels and a magnetic coil system Reaction wheels provide the agility for movements The magnet coil system solely would not be suf\002cient to meet the requirements of agility and accuracy However the reaction wheels would either not work alone because they have to desaturated i.e the angular momentum is reduced by an external torque 050coils in response to the earth's magnetic 002eld\051 Both systems in combination allow different attitude modes with different attitude requirements 017 Uniaxial e.g to the sun 017 Relative inertial 3-axis stabilized e.g for a point in time 017 Absolute inertial 3-axis stabilized e.g to the earth To enable a three-axis stabilization TET-1 needs a reaction wheel in each axis However four wheels are mounted in a hot redundant con\002guration This tetrahedral con\002guration allows a malfunction of one of the four wheels without a loss of performance The magnet coil system is internally redundant i.e each coil consists of two windings each with an independent electrical interface The star tracker consists of two cold redundant data processing units 050DPUs\051 each being connected to the two camera head units 050CHUs\051 The magnetic 002eld sensor and the gyrosystem are cold redundant and there are two sun sensor systems in hot redundancy The high degree of the system's availability is implemented by several autonomy mechanisms If something fails the system autonomously switches to the ACS safe mode that guarantees contact to ground stations and power supply FDIR in ACS The ACS software of TET-1 consists of multiple layers the low level layer the high level layer and the interface layer see Fig 9 The FDIR mechanisms at low level inspect the communication structures between components Afterwards formal checks are performed e.g it is checked if data arrives with correct check sums at the right time and with the valid identi\002ers As a result a 002rst status information is derived which is forwarded to the estimator module in the next higher level High level analyses and FDIR occurs in the EPC layer Figure 9  Overview of the ACS of TET-1 Astround Feinwerktechnik Adlershof 050the high layer\051 of the ACS software If a component failed the 002rst level of FDIR checks in the lower layer its status is set to unhealthy for the current control cycle Measurements of the healthy sensors are compared to predicted sensor states and the deviance between measurements and predicted values is compared to tolerance boundaries The used tolerance boundaries are ACS parameters that can be changed by tele command 050TC\051 The result is that sensors and actuators in the corresponding ACS con\002guration vectors are otherwise marked with healthy 050everything is in order\051 or not healthy 050something is not correct\051 These checks are always renewed impartially in each control cycle and independently of their history except when on ground the decision has already been made and commanded Sensors can also have the state powered/not powered which is usually derived from the relay status of the component but can also be set by TC The used/not used 003ag indicates if the components shall be used for attitude determination and control in this control cycle This state can be set by the mode controller 050i.e not using the star tracker during rough sun pointing\051 but can also be set by TC Sensors marked unhealthy are ignored by the high level software and their measurements are predicted however no autonomous hardware switch to the redundant unit is performed An important FDIR mechanism of the ACS is the ACS surveillance monitor It monitors the software threads and logs important events inside the ACS Particular monitoring is performed on the time dependencies necessary for a correct communication between threads For speci\002c timing violations and major deviances between the actual and expected threads the surveillance monitor requests the reboot of the satellite board computer 050SBC\051 and/or the satellite safe mode because the functionality of the ACS is vital for the survival of the satellite The triggering of a satellite safe mode can be deactivated temporarily 050e.g software upload\051 with known restrictions during the operation of the satellite Moreover log entries are kept and telemetry is made available also from the previous control cycle where the failure did not occur yet If the surveillance monitor requests reboot or safe mode the occurred failure could therefore not be solved on the subsystem level but passed to the next level of the satellites FDIR system While fault detection and isolation are part of the subsystem recovery is left to the operational team on ground Thus full recon\002gurations still depend on tele commands Hence we propose a quality-based approach for autonomic recon\002gurations on architectural level For that we introduce an evolution scenario of the ACS subsystem Evolution Scenario We assume that an emulation of the attitude control by reaction wheels 050RW1,2,3,4\051 is possible by an enhanced variant of the magnet coil system 050MCS\051 The evolved system is still imprecise and less agile On the one hand attitude control needs more time to change the position of the satellite on the other hand total energy consumption of the system is low As depicted in Fig 10 we de\002ned three architectures of attitude control for the given evolution scenario Here we focus on recon\002gurations on a functional level and abstract from usage scenarios 050e.g a speci\002c mission goal\051 To apply our approach to the evolved system some preparations for self-recon\002guration has to be done at design time The basic steps are 0501\051 to de\002ne architectures 0502\051 to measure their quality and 0503\051 to arrange the architectures in an ARG including the speci\002cation of hardware requirements for each architecture 050see Fig 11\051 6

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
