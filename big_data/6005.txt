 I NTRODUCTION  Big data processing  has become a fundamental issue in modern information technology. After De an and Ghemawat have introduced the MapReduce framework in 2004 [1  it h as  been employed popularly both in industries [2, 3 an d  in open source communities [4  I t supports  a simple but powerful programming model, and an infrastructure  that distributes da ta into multiple chucks and processes them in parallel by managing numerous map and reduce tasks  Traditionally, the MapReduce framework works on a large physical cluster that consists of physical machines such as commodity PCs and servers [1   R ec en tly  a s the virtualization technology and cloud computing become prevalent, the framework also makes use of virtualized environments that consist of virtual machines [5, 6, 7, 8  F o r in s t an ce  w e ca n

The advent of multicore and the usage of huge main memory make it feasible for the CPU and memory virtualization to work efficiently However, the I/O virtualization suffers from the performan 
ce degradation [11, 12, 13  S h af er h as r e p o r te d  th at s t o r ag e  bandwidth is reduced to 51% and 77% of a non virtualized disk for reads and writes, respective ly  11  T hi s de g r a da t i o n  gi v e s  a  great concern  for big data processing  Our analysis has revealed that, in virtualized environments each virtual machine has a tendency to issue I/Os in a bursty manner, especially when the map and reduce tasks perform the spill and merge operations [8  A ls o  s ev e r al v i r tu al m ac h in es  trigger the bursty I/Os concurrentl y due to the characteristics of the M a pReduce programming  model  T he s e  c o nc u r r e n t a nd bursty I/Os triggered by different virtual machines incur I/O interferences, resulting in considerable context switch overhead among virtual machines and long seek di stances in a disk  
To alleviate the I/O interferences, we propose a novel burstiness aware I/O scheduler. The key idea of our scheduler is identifying bursty virtual machines on line and scheduling them in a round robin fashion with relatively large  time quantum During the  time quantum, a scheduled virtual machine can exploit most of disk bandwidth in an isolated manner, leading to decrease the I/O interferences greatly. In addition, to avoid a starvation situation, we reserve minimum I/O bandwidth for th e non bursty virtual machines  We have implemented the proposed scheduler in the XEN hypervisor using the control group mechanism [14   Performance evaluation results with two benchmarks have shown that the scheduler can improve the I/O bandwidth up to 23  with an ave rage of 20 compared with the original I/O 
scheduler. Sensitivity analysis have shown that the proposed  scheduler can reduce the seek distance 52% on average  This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the motivation of our work. Then, the burstiness aware I/O scheduler is  discussed  in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the performance evaluation results Finally, conclusion and future work are summarized in Section 5   II M OTIVATION  In this section, we describe the motivation o f our work. We first explain  our MapReduce framework that  is based on 305 


virtualized environments. Then, we present our observation and discuss the reason s  of the I/O performance degrada tion   Figure 1 shows our experimental M a pReduce framework based on a vir tual cluster consists of virtual machines. Our system is composed of four cores AMD Phenom processor 8GB DDR3 DRAM, and 500GB SATA disk as shown at the bottom layer. On top of the physical hardware, we install the XEN hypervisor  that abstracts physical re sources into multiple virtual resources. On these virtual resources, we create 1 control machine and 4 virtual machines Each virtual machine executes a GuestOS such as M icrosoft  windows and Linux supporting an independent computing platform. The control domain  is in charge of managing I/O devices and actually c arries out I/O accesses on behalf of GuestOSes   Fig. 1 MapReduce framework based on a virtual cluster  On these virtual machines, we install the H a doop, which is the open source MapReduce framework [4   H a doop consists of a name node and several data nodes. When a MapReduce application is delivered to the name node it creates map and reduce tasks  and assigns them into the data nodes. Each data node executes its assigned map and reduce tasks. In our expe rimental system, we use the control domain as the name node whil e using virtual machines as data nodes  Now let us discuss the I/O behaviors of H a doop in virtualized environments. The input data of a M a pReduce application is divided into multiple chucks, w hose size is typically 128MB or 256MB. Each map task reads its chuck perform s  the map operation, and writes intermediate files by carrying out the spill and merge operations [8   E a ch  r e d u ce  task performs the shuffle, merge and reduce operations in sequen ce, and finally generates  output files  Note that the spill and merge operations make use of the buffer mechanism. They keep data in the DRAM buffer and flush  out all data when buffer is almost full \(specifically, when the size of the buffered  data become s larger than a threshold called   in H a doop [8    C o ns i d e r i n g t h e  large size of intermediate and output files, and the flushing out effect of the spill and merge operations, I/Os triggered  by a virtual machine tend to be bursty This t endency has also been observed in 15  I n  a d d it io n   th e n am e n o d e d is p at ch es a n d  schedules the map tasks on virtual machines at the same time It implies that the bursty I/Os are triggered  by multiple virtual machines at the same time  Since the virtual machines locate  on a single physical machine, the bursty I/Os generated by multiple vi rtual machines concurrently have a potential to cause  the I/O performance degradation. To estimate this effect quantitatively we measure the I/O bandwidth under the two different cases One is the case where a single virtual machine issues bursty I/Os  alone while the other is the case where 4 virtual machines issue bursty I/Os concurrently. For emulating bursty I/Os, we run the UNIX 221 DD 222  command on each virtual machine t hat accesses a file whose size is 1GB   Fig. 2 Performance degradation due to the I/O interferences among virtual machines  Figure 2 presents the measurement results In the  single virtual machine case, the I/O bandwidth is re ported as 140MB s which is close to  the upper bound supported  by our experime ntal disk. On the contrary, in the  4 virtual machines case, the I/O bandwidth drops to the 96.7MB s which is the 31% reduction compared with the singe virtual machine  case  Our sensitivity analysis has uncovered that the performance degradation is due to the I/O interferences among virtual machines. The control domain in XEN uses the CFQ  Complete Fairness Queuing I/O sched uler for  support ing  fair I/O services to virtual machines [16  I t s ch ed u l es I Os i n a  inte rleaved manner among virtual machines, handling a I/O from one virtual machine and the next I/O from the other virtual machine. In other words, I/Os triggered by a virtual machine is interfered by other I/Os triggered by different virtual machines  In the  control domain I/Os triggered by a virtual machine are managed by a  corresponding task, called  which will be described in detail in Figure 3. Therefore, the I/O interferences among virtual machines incur frequent context switches among the Blkba ck tasks. Besides, I/Os requested by different virtual machines usually have sector numbers whose gap is quite large. As a result the I/O interferences cause long seek distances in a d isk which will be further discussed in Table 2. These two overheads re sult in the performance degradation observed in Figure 2. Note that the degradation becomes more serious as the I/Os become bursty   III B URSTINESS AWARE I/O  S CHEDULER  To alleviate the performance degradation observed in Figure 2, we propose a new burstiness aw are I/O scheduler The key ideas of our proposed scheduler are as follows; 1 allows a bursty virtual machine to consume most of disk 306 


b andwidth for a given period exclusively to reduce the I/O interferences, 2\ when there are several bursty virtual machine s schedules them in a round robin fashion to support fairness at the coarse grained level, and 3\ reserves minimal  disk  bandwidth for non bursty virtual machines to avoid a  starvation situation  Figure 3 illustrates the overall structure of our proposed scheduler. It consist s of three components, namely      and    Also, it has three control parameters, namely    and     Fig. 3 Structure of the burstiness aware I/O sched uler   When a virtual machine requests I/Os, it delivers them to the corresponding Blkback task in the control domain. The Blkback task is a kind of daemon process actually performs I/O s  on a disk on behalf of  the related virtual machine. It sends the requ ested I/Os to the Block I/O layer that consists of the CFQ I/O scheduler and native device drivers. Our proposed scheduler locates between the Blkback task s  and the Block I/O layer, orchestrating the I/O flow between them  At first, the Burstiness Detecto r examines  I/Os managed by each Blkback task and determines whether the I/Os are bursty or not. For this purpose, we introduce  the control parameter B_threshold. When the total  bandwidth required by a Blkback task is larger than the B_threshold, the task is treated as bursty  When there are several bursty Blkback tasks, the Coarse Grained Dispatcher  schedules them in a round robin fashion The scheduled task is allowed to consume most of disk bandwidth during a given time quantum namely S _quantum   which is our second control parameter In Figure 3, we assume that the B lkback 1, 2 and 3 are determined  as bursty and scheduled by the Coarse Grained Dispatcher as shown the scheduling flow   Finally, the Starvation Handler  monitors the non bursty tasks and ha ndles their I/Os  if they are read requests But, the total I/Os handled are restricted under the M_reserved, minimal reserved bandwidth to decrease the I/O interferences caused by non bursty tasks This mechanism is devised to avoid the starvation of the non bursty tasks Note that a task may suffer from delayed  services  due to the restriction. However, the delayed requests enlarge  the required disk bandwidth, which eventually leads the task to be determined as bursty and managed by the Coarse Grained Disp atcher   If there is no bursty task, all I/Os are processed like the way as the original I/O scheduler does  IV E XPERIMENT S  We have implemented the burstiness aware  I/O scheduler in our experimental system depicted  in Figure 1  We use  the XEN hypervisor 4.1.4 as the virtualization software, Linux kernel 3.5.5 as GuestOS both for control domain and virtual machines. The Hadoop 1.1.0 is used as the MapReduce framework Our proposed scheduler is implemented in the control domain, using the blkio subsystem  supporte d by the control group mechanism   T hi s m e c ha n i s m a l l o w s us t o configure tasks as several groups and allocates I/O bandwidth to each group independently  Physical resources and virtual resources per each virtual machine are summarized in Table 1. This table also shows how we set the control parameters of the proposed scheduler in this experiment  TABLE I E XPERIMENTAL E NVIRONMENT  Virtualization  software  XEN 4.1.4  GuestOS  Linux 3.5.5  MapReduce framework  Hadoop 1.1.0  Workload  1GB Read/Write using 221DD\222 command  and \221FIO benchmark  Physical resources  CPU  AMD Phenom 231 II x4  Memory  8  GB  Disk  500  GB  Virtual resources per virtual machine  CPU  B ased on Credit scheduler  same credit  Memory  1  GB  Disk  100 GB  Type  Full Virtualization  Control Parameters  B _thres hold  2 MB/s  S _quantum  1 second  M_reserved  2 MB/s   Figure 4 presents the performance evaluation results   We run a benchmark \(DD or FIO\ on four virtual machines concurrently under the two different conditions. One is based on the original I/O scheduler  denoted as 4VMs in the figure and the other is based on  our proposed I/O scheduler \(denoted as 4VMs BA   Fig. 4 I/O bandwidth comparison   The results show that our proposal yields better performance, improving 17% for the DD benchmark and 23 307 


for the FIO be nchmark. The figure also reveals th at four virtual machines obtain  similar I/O bandwidth. It implies that, even though our scheduler allows a virtual machine to monopolize  most of Disk bandwidth  during the time quantum it supports fairness at a coarse gra ined viewpoint  We expect that the performance improvements observed in Figure 4 are owing to two reasons, one is reducing context switch overheads among Blkback tasks and the other is decreasing the seek distances in a disk. To validate the latter reason  we measure the sector distance  that is the sector number gap  between two consecutive processed I/Os In modern disks, the seek distance is proportional to the sector distance     TABLE II S ECTOR  D ISTANCE  AND E LAPSED TIME COMPARIS ON S   Total s ector  distance  Elap sed time   DD  FIO  DD  FIO  4VMs  12  2516E+11  8.91754E+11  49.3  48.6  4VMs BA  4.8461E+11  5.01637E+11  40.2  41.7  Reduction  Percentage  60.4  43.7  18.4  14.1   Table 2 presents the total  sector distance during the execution of each benchmark T he results show t hat, by reducing the I/O interferences, the proposed scheduler indeed reduce the overall sector distances. The table also presents the elapsed time of each benchmark The improvement of the I/O bandwidth  leads to boost the response time  V C ONCLUSION  In this  paper we explore the feasibility  of the MapReduce framework on virtualized environments. One concern  is the I/O bottleneck, which is caused by the I/O interferences among  virtual machines, especially during the processing of big data To mitigate this pr oblem we proposed a new I/O scheduler that can identify bursty virtual machines and give a chance for them to use most of disk bandwidth without violating fairness  We are considering  two  research directions as  future work  The first direction is  experime nting our proposal with real MapReduce applications  such as terasort and distributed grep  In current experiments, we emulate the big data processing using the DD and FIO benchmark with a large input file. Even though we conjecture that the I/O interferenc es are also observed in real MapReduce applications we want to verify it and extend our proposal if there are any distinct I/O behaviors The second direction is analyzing  the sensitivity of the control parameters used in the proposed scheduler  VI A CKNOWLE DGE  This work was supported by the Industrial Strategic technology development program\(10039143, Multi Gbps Parallel I/O Virtualization and DB Performance Optimization for the Data centric Computing on Many core System\ funded by the Ministry of Knowledge Econ omy, Korea   R EFERENCES   J.

The connection termination is initiated by the module \(Line 17 - Fig. 3\by sending a FIN message to the module. In return, the  module replies with a FIN+ACK message and then the  module replies with an ACK message IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  Real life data sets are essential for the evaluation of any defense system. Very few data sets representing real DDoS attacks are publicly available, mostly because of legal and privacy issues. This study is validated using two real world Internet traffic traces, each of them are available in the public domain For a real-world DDoS attack, we have used çThe CAIDA DDoS Attack 2007é Data set [24   T h is  da ta se t c o n ta in s  approximately one hour of anonymized traffic traces of DDoS attacks captured on August 4, 2007. This data set represents DDoS attacks where the attackers attempt to block access to the targeted victim by consuming computing resources on the victim and by consuming all of the bandwidth of the network connecting the victim to the Internet. The total size of the data set is 21 GB On the other hand, çThe CAIDA anonymized Internet traces October 2012é Data set [25 is th e  da ta set  re pr esen t i n g the normal traffic used in our work. This data set contains approximately one hour of anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's Equinix-Sanjose monitor on high-speed Internet links. The total size of this data set in one direction is 67.7 GB The characteristics of the CAIDA attack and normal data sets in terms of the traffic volume are presented in Fig. 4 \(black line\ and Fig. 5, respectively. Fig. 4 \(black line\ shows the CAIDA DDoS attack where after the initial 26 minutes, the traffic rate abruptly jumps and attains the maximum. This maximum is held for the remainder of the attack period. In DDoS attacks, the compromised machines \(bots\ are infected by malwares which are programed to direct traffic to the victim at their maximum capacity. In order to accelerate the damage the bot master triggers the bots simultaneously. On getting the commands from the bot master, bots start to forward the traffic to the victim. Therefore, the v ictim experiences a sudden burst in the incoming traffic over a relativity short period of time This causes the victim to exceed its maximum tolerable limits and thereby, forces the victim to slow down its normal operations, or even shut down in some cases. In contrast to this, the traffic rate of the normal traffic gradually increases over time, Fig. 5. Hence, it should be possible to use this difference in the rates of incoming traffic to identify the DDoS attack. The DDoS detection component is invoked at regular time intervals to analyze the rate of incoming packets. In this case, such a sudden change in the average incoming traffic is used as the evidence of a DDoS attack by the DDoS detection component \(in fact human experts and other systems also use this type of information\. As stated earlier, the traffic histories of individual traffic sources \(differentiating the individual traffic sources is performed by the IP traceback component\ are considered before rending a rate limit request to the  module. For example, a change from an average of 40,000 incoming packets over the first 25 minutes versus an average of approximately 1,500,000 packets over the first 27 minutes is taken as a sign of a DDoS attack Indeed, a good defense system for such DDoS attacks should be able to mitigate the impact of the attack and it should maximize the high survival rate of legitimate traffic. To achieve this, 3 parameters are considered Rate Limit  is the maximum rate of incoming packets from the attacker that the victim can tolerate. This parameter should be defined by the module before it establishes a connection to the module Increasing Rate In the slow start phase, the module should gradually increase the forwarding rate by  can be calculated as a fraction of the last forwarding rate before the module performs the congestion avoidance phase Waiting Time This parameter indicates the time intervals \(in seconds\ between each update in the forwarding rate during the slow start phase The desirable  and parameters should result in a higher incoming rate of the legitimate packets and a lower incoming rate of the attack packets. Moreover, it should enable a lower communication and bandwidth overhead. It should also enable a lower duration for the sl ow start phase that incurs less delay in the rate limit removal after the attack is over

E VALUATION RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH BY DIFFERENT VALUES OF and open source applications [26 to  f o rw ard all  t h e traffic to a computer, in this case the victim node. In addition we developed two programs, one as the module located at the victim end and the other as the module located at the edge router The parameter determines the attack rate reduction. The and the parameters do not have any impact on this Choosing the value of is a tradeoff between the receiving rate of legitimate and DDoS packets from the same subnetwork. While lower is more effective in reducing the attack, which is desirable, at the same time it reduces the incoming rate of the legitimate traffic, which is undesirable Vice versa, higher maximizes the rate of legitimate traffic but increases the impact of a DDoS attack. Selecting the  greatly depends on different network conditions and traffic patterns such as the victimês bandwidth, the CPU and memory capacity of the victim, the total incoming traffic from all the individual traffic sources, and the traffic history of the attacker network. We evaluated our system twice  by setting the  parameter to 10 Mb/s and 15 Mb/s, so when the incoming traffic rate exceeds these limits, the module starts the communication with the PF module to mitigate the impact of the attack. Obviously choosing higher values maximize the rate of the legitimate traffic, but also increase the impact of a DDoS attack Fig. 4 presents the incoming DDoS traffic rate to the victim, with and without using the proposed TDFA defense system. It shows that the cooperation between the and  modules is started around 26 th minute to control the incoming rate of DDoS packets. Our evaluation results show that our proposed system reduces the attack by 88% and 83% by setting 10 Mb/s \(red line\ and 15 Mb/s \(blue line respectively The parameter has a decisive role in the amount of communication overhead. As the increases \(increasing the time interval between each forwarding rate update\, the communication between the and the modules decreases which is desirable. The duration of the slow start phase can be calculated by Eq. 2  As can be seen in Eq. 2, the and the parameters have direct and inverse relations with the duration of the slow start phase, respectively. However, the parameter does not have any relation with the duration of the slow start phase. A higher and a lower incur more delay in the rate limit removal after the attack ends, which is undesirable. On the other hand the IR value should be kept small, so that the and the  modules can adjust the traffic rate around the value more accurately. Therefore, selecting an appropriate value for the parameter is a tradeoff between the communication overhead and the delay in the rate limit removal after the attack is over Since the DDoS traffic rate in the Caida datatset reaches the maximum in 50 seconds, the slow start phase duration should not exceed this period. So, in the worst case, 50 seconds after an attack is completed, the PF module removes the rate limit Note that if the system can tolerate more communication overhead, it is better to reduce the slow start phase duration as much as possible. We repeated our evaluation by setting the to  and seconds and the to to keep the slow start phase duration less than 50 seconds \(Eq. 2\. Table 2 shows the results of these evaluations. As you can see increasing or decreasing the parameter does not have high impact on the attack rate reduction. However, choosing the lower causes more communication and therefore more bandwidth overhead between the and the modules. On the other hand, higher increases the slow start phase duration and therefore, incurs delay in the rate limit removal after the attack completion. Selecting an appropriate value of is determined based on the priority of the lower communication overhead \(higher value\, or the lower latency in the rate limit removal after the attack completion Lower value\. Therefore, all the results presented in Table 2 are equally good. In short, different values of can be set based on the different priorities of the organization that manages the network Fig. 6 presents the incoming DDoS traffic rate with and without filtering between the 24 th and 30 th minutes \(the time period that the sudden burst happens\ at 1 second intervals. As shown in this figure, once the incoming attack traffic exceeds the 10 Mb/sec\ value \(this at 26.31 minutes\, the  module performs the congestion avoidance phase to halve the forwarding rate immediately. Then the forwarding rate increases gradually at each period \(in this case, 2 seconds by 0.5 Mb/s\ in the slow start phase. So it takes 20 seconds

  to reach to the RL again \(slow start phase duration\. Then the congestion avoidance phase is ente red. This is the reason why the forwarding rate decreases and increases alternately. This process is performed over and over until the end of the attack This is determined when the PF senses that the incoming rate is less than the forwarding rate \(the drop rate is zero In the proposed system, the filtering decision is made by the module at the victim end, so the module does not incur any overhead on the edge routers for making such filtering decisions. In addition, filtering is an embedded and a key feature of almost all the Internet edge routers, so there is no overhead related to installing such a feature on an edge router. The overhead of the modules on the edge routers is as low as computing the packet drop rate and communicating with the module by sending the ACK and the update messages. Therefore, a very low processing overhead \(in our experiments a few milliseconds\ incurred at the edge routers V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  One of the major defense chal lenges against DDoS attacks is how to control the attack traffic to preserve the quality of service of the legitimate traffic. To address this issue, we have proposed TDFA, a traceback based defense system against flooding attacks that make use of spoofed addresses. The proposed framework uses the strategy of detecting the attack as well as finding the source of the attack at the victim end, and responding to the attack at the source end. These tasks are carried out by the traffic adjustment module \(TF\, DFM IP traceback algorithm at the victim end, and the packet filtering module at the edge router of the source end, respectively The recovery process is also triggered if the traffic returns to normal. In this work, we have implemented and evaluated the proposed system, TDFA, against the real-world DDoS and normal traffic traces. Our results show that TDFA efficiently drops the attack packets at the source end of the attack, while imposing a low overhead on the edge routers participating in the defense. Moreover, the location of defense modules are fully in line with the location of DFM IP traceback modules making the scheme more deployable. For future work, we plan to implement and evaluate the se curing of the TDFA system itself. In the absence of an appropriate security mechanism, an attacker can deceive the edge router into doing wrong filtering A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research is supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada \(NSERC\ grant, and is conducted as part of the Dalhousie NIMS Lab at https://projects.cs.dal.ca/projectx R EFERENCES  1

 11    Figure 7: Cost estimated per subsystem \(bar chart on top\of one spacecraft  Small Satellite Cost Model \(SSCM\ based on inputs for a candidate nano-satellite mission \(bottom excel spreadsheet   The SSCM model was then used to calculate the total cost of developing and manufacturing only the first small satellite of mass 10 kg and other specifications listed  Figure 7 The cost calculated for every subsystem and the total cost of $15.08 million in FY 2010 is therefore a function of technological variables like power and pointing and not just mass  To check the sensitivity of technology used to cost we varied some of the input parameters and checked its effect on cost in FY97 $million. Changing the data rate from 10 kbps to 10 MBps to 1 GBps resulted in a cost of $11.35 11.4 and 11.45 million respectively Since COTS products will be used to support the communication link these cost estimates imply that there will be only a 100,000 difference in deploying a radio transmitter 10 kbps\ or deploying an optical transmitter \(1 GBps\ on the 10 kg nano-satellite While previous proposals have certainly supported the availability for laser technologies 50   t h e o p tical d e m o n s tr ati o n s  t h at ar e c u r r en tl y  b ei n g  developed by DLR in Germany and the Aerospace Corporation in the US 51  clea r l y  d e m o n s tr ate  th a t t h e  cost of optical technology is more than that Similarly changing the pointing accuracy from 0.1 0.01 to 0.001 degrees resulted in the cost increasing from FY97 $ 6.45 11.33 and 22.21 million respectively The technology to support 0.1 degrees \(sun sensors\ is different from that to support 0.001 degrees star trackers However current COTS quotations \(e.g. Blue Canyon technologies XACT show that it costs 100,000 for a nanosat star tracker system Integration may cost a few additional thousands but estimating it to 18 million more sounds a bit too much  The SSCM sensitivity study above highlights the need to have cost models that are more sensitive to different technologies and their associated complexities Complexity and risk assessment has been proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the form of their COBRA model  We used the COBRA model in our next study where the methodology and data sets are detailed in \([39   40    5 2     T h e d ata s et r elati v e to  w h ic h  co m p le x ities  ar e  calculated included 120 DoD and NASA missions from after FY89 excluded launch delays or failures and projects with heavy international cooperation. Complexity drivers include  Table 4  column 1 subsystem technical parameters e.g mass power performance technology choices\ and programmatic factors \(e.g., heritage, level of redundancy, foreign partnership  Forty such parameters are considered that are either continuous e.g mass power and represent a range of values bounded by a minimum and maximum, or discrete such as propulsion type \(none, cold gas, monopropellant bipropellant or ion engine\ that represent a finite number of choices    For our smallsat case study, the factors corresponding to spacecraft complexity as they proposed are listed in Table 4 along with the minimum and maximum value that the component takes within their data set The column  candidate nano-satellite which will be a part of a DSM  different 3D angles from the same ground spot as it formation flies in LEO 53  5 4 55    Fo r  ea ch  f ac to r   the complexity of the nanosat is calculated as a percentage of where the data point corresponding to the nanosat lies with respect to the data points for all the other space missions considered. For discrete data, the discrete rank of the data is assessed and then converted into a percentage The average complexity of the proposed nanosat is calculated to be 21.64 


 12  Table 4: Cost estimated for a spacecraft as a function of the relative complexity of its components with respect to components used in previous missions  Based Risk Assessment \(COBRA\ model. Inputs \(Data in Column 3\ are from a candidate nanosatellite mission    The map between complexity percentile and required mission cost and development time for successful missions green triangles is shown in Figure 8  using a green trend line. The missions plotted are among the 120 studied missions and equations are mentioned within the  attempted cheaper than or faster than this model predicts then there is a large probability of failure as highlighted by the red and yellow crosses on Figure 8  Using the above model the estimated cost for our candidate nanosatellite 10 kg mission is 35.824 million and the estimated development time is 35.074 months The high cost is in keeping with the intuition expressed in the data collection section that the cost of LEO small satellites are driven more by technology than mass so the utility of shrinking the satellite should be critically assessed and avoided if the mission technology is very state of art In such cases, micro satellites would win the performance to cost ratio battle    Figure 8: Predicted mission cost and development time as a function of relative mission complexity with respect to other missions evaluated by the Aerospace Corporation [39    4 0     5 2    M is s io n c o m ple x it y  is  a  function of component complexities as calculated in Table 4 The candidate mission is a LEO satellite measuring passive Earth reflectance as part of a DSM  We ran a sensitivity analysis for the COBRA model by varying the deltaV and pointing accuracy required by the candidate satellite It does a great job in predicting the increase in costs from 1 degree to 0.01 or 0.1 degree, by 


 13  estimating a $ 200-250 increase. It overshoots the COTS quotations by a slight margin but is certainly better than the SSCM estimate of  18 million more When the required delta-V is increased from none to 40 m/s to 80 m/s to 120 m/s the respective costs are estimated to be FY97 $ 35.79, 35.82, 35.85 and 35.88 million. Quotations from a 3D cold gas propulsion system printing company called AustinSat revealed that their 1U propulsion unit capable of providing 40 m/s of delta V costs 100,000 with 6DOF thrusters included and would scale almost linearly as more 1U units are added for 40 m/s of more delta-V  The COTS systems therefore cost more than what the COBRA model predicts. The model can thus be improved and made more suitable for COTS-supported small satellites if COTS data and figures were included in the data set to calculate complexity. Since we do not have the data set only the published Figure 8  we could not make the changes  Since many small satellite missions are collaborations between many organizations, the COBRA model could be improved by adding a foreign partnership complexity factor that captures the number of collaborators not just the nationality For example a recent paper 56   formulated a data supported method of capturing international cooperation related complexity using cyclometric  complexity where CGF  0.917  0.0575*CyclometricNumber and CyclometricNumber  f\(nodes, edges, outputs    Figure 9: Cost growth required to support increasing TRL for any component as published in [57    Small satellites are always pushing the boundaries of technology. It is very probable that some of its component values will fall out of range available from past missions In such a case, cost models of TRL transition such as the one shown in Figure 9  57  s h o u ld  b e in co r p o r ated  in to  the COBRA model for the relevant factors Although TRL transition correlates to the spending it does not follow traditional 80-20 rule The COBRA model also does not capture the structural complexity of a small tightly packed satellite which has been theoretically shown to drive development costs. Structural complexity can be quantified using a simple framework shown in Figure 10 35  34   an d  ca n  b e ea s il y  i n tr o d u ce d  i n  t h e COBRA model via a new factor and recalculating the data fit  Capturing the above development costs is important for small satellites whose costs are driven more by technology than by mass. Again, since we do not have the data set \(only the published Figure 8 we could not make the changes   Figure 10 Structural complexity metric introduced and validated in [35  a nd   3 4    5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify three major problems with current cost and risk models that limit their direct application to estimating the costs of DSMs They are the absence of reliable learning curve factors small satellite 20 kg costing tools and operations costing  Existing models and methodologies that may be applicable in part to DSMs have been identified and presented using an extensive literature survey We select ed  some appropriate methods and applied them to estimate the cost of small satellites and small satellite DSMs The exercise helped us point out valuable insights and/or inconsistencies in the results with respect to the data We also suggest methods to modify the models so that they become more suitable for small satellite DSMs  As future work the operations cost model and dynamic complexity of the mission is expected to be captured by a Systems Dynamics Model Re sults from model simulations can provide insight into the effect of design and operation decisions on lifecycle cost and risk expected to improve upon the Monte Carlo results The model results can guide the trade-off of cost with performance and can help in the se lection of a final point design for any given DSM
