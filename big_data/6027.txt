Using Advanced ML For Improving Surveillance Accuracy Tripti Meena Department of Electrical Engineering IIT Bombay India Email triptm7@gmail.com Abstract An increase in research over the past 60 years in the eld of machine learning widened its areas of application from merely making computers learn to play board games to analysis of big data Many algorithms have been developed that are now commonly used in various elds ranging from natural language processing to computational nance and has been brought to use commercially as well Recently there has been an increase in research on machine learning application in the area of automated video surveillance systems Most of these algorithms assume that both the training data and test data belong to same feature space with same distribution which might not always be true This constraint gave rise to the concept of transfer learning which uses the knowledge from the preoccupied knowledge from other related task This paper aims at improving the efìciency of a transfer learning based machine learning technique for object classiìcation MKTL framework It can be brought to use for multiclass object classiìcation in automated video surveillance systems Keywords Support Vector Machines transfer learning supervised learning   1I NTRODUCTION W ith the increase in crime levels over the last 10 years at many places public fear has grown for safety Security is one of the foremost necessities of a human being The installation of CCTV cameras as a control measure has proved to be effective to some extent A huge amount of data is produced in any video surveillance system In the traditional surveillance systems the recordings are monitored manually But this is a very strenuous task inviting a high risk of human errs In recent years there has been an increase in research in the area of automation of surveillance systems Machine learning approaches have also come into picture in addition to various image and pixel matching algorithms E.g agglomerative clustering reciprocal nearest neighbor pair K-nearest neighbor K means clustering and pixel and block based similarity check Machine vision focuses on how a machine can be made more intelligent Using the present machine learning techniques for object detection and classiìcation the surveillance videos can be analyzed for anomalies with minimal human assistance and only the events that are of interest can be brought to notice up to a certain limit in efìciency These techniques aims at developing system that can auto detect any suspicious condition based on some prior knowledge set Based on the availability of prior knowledge the machine learning task can be supervised learning unsupervised learning semi-supervised learning or transductive learning For surveillance systems supervised learning can be brought to use as set of labeled inputs in the training set can be made available An automated video surveillance system would typically consist of three major steps background removal object detection classiìcation Background removal in a video sequence can be done by extracting steady state component using techniques like frame difference average ltering using kalman lters hidden Markov model A lot of literature in image processing provides methods for object detection In this paper we focus on the object classiìcation part of the system Here we try to analyze an object classiìcation method that can be brought to use in a video surveillance system for computerizing the monitoring of the videos and alerting whenever a 2014 International Conference on the IMpact of E-Technology on US \(IMPETUS 978-9332-9026-40/14/$31.00 ©2014IEEE 34 


Fig 1 A system for video surveillance Fig 2 Object detection in surveillance video potential threat is detected The method that we are considering to be used for classiìcation of scene as a potential threat is the Multi Kernel Transfer Learning as proposed in paper with an impro v ement by using polynomial radial basis function kernels instead of the traditional radial basis function kernel as suggested in into the frame w ork 2O BJECT CLASSIFICATION USING M A CHINE L EARNING Object classiìcation is the task of detecting and classifying any given image of an object into one of the sets of known classes Transfer learning based object classiìcation algorithm has three major aspects  Feature representation  Classiìcation using a machine learning approach  Transfer learning 2.1 Feature representation Images consist of pixels which are basically numbers that represent a color A feature is a numerical representation of an image A good representative feature should have the following properties Repeatability distinctiveness/imformativeness locality quantity accuracy efìciency There are a lot of different features used for representing images Most common of them are color histogram SIFT PCA-SIFT 12 SURF  PHOG 15 LESH 16 GLOH 17 F o r our  Feature Merits Demerits Color Histogram Easy to evaluate Considers color ignores shape and texture of object SIFT Exhibits scale rotation invariance and invariance to afìne transformation Slow and not good at illumination changes SURF Very fast as compared to SIFT Not stable to rotation and illumination changes PCA-SIFT Size of the feature is small Not good at blurred images PHOG Good representation of local shapes easy to evaluate Ignores at area and cannot deal with noisy edge region TABLE 1 Different Feature descriptors current problem of object classiìcation SURF and PHOG features are used as input to the classiìcation algorithm as in 2.2 Classiìcation Algorithms A machine learning algorithm generally has a training set and a test set of data The data in case of images consist of the feature vectors Using the training data set models are derived that are used to classify a test data Different available supervised learning algorithms include linear classiìers SVMs quadratic classiìers k means clustering boosting decision tree neural networks Bayesian networks We here brieîy describe Nave Bayes classiìer SVMs and Multi-Kernel learning 35 


Naive Bayes Classiìer The Naive Bayes assumption is that all features are conditionally independent given the class label Given a set of variables X  x 1 x 2  x x k  the posterior probability for the event E i that belongs to the set of outcomes E  e 1 e 2 e 3   e k can be obtained using Bayes rule p  E i  x 1 x 2   x k   p  x 1 x 2   x k  E i  p  E i  1 where p  E i  x 1 x 2   x k  is the probability that X belongs to E i  Due to the assumption of statistical independence the probability p  X  E i  can be written as p  X  E i   k  j 1 p  x j E i  2 and hence the posterior probability as p  E i  X   p  E i  k  j 1 p  x j E i  3 Using Bayes rule a new test data X is labeled to the class that achieves the highest posterior probability Naive Bayes classìer works well when normal distribution is involved But it is not capable of solving more complex classiìcation problems Another classiìer that is complex and slow but capable of solving complex classiìcation problem is the support vector machines Support Vector Machine Classiìer SVM is one of the most commonly used binary linear classiìer A linear classiìer assumes that the data is linearly separable In SVMs the input data is seen as two sets of vectors in an n dimensional space These sets are then separated by a n  1 dimensional hyperplane in the space Many a times more than one such hyperplane exist So the one which maximizes the margin between the two sets is chosen Given a real vector  x as input to the classiìer the output score is given by y  f   w   x  f   j w j x j  4 where  w is a real vector of weights that is learned using training samples and f is a function that maps the input  x to a class based on the value of weighted sum of the features Binary classiìcation using SVM Let there be two classes Class 1  X  X 1 X 2  X n Class  1  Y  Y 1 Y 2  Y m Data points with known labels constitute the training set A Classiìer is trained on training set and then tested on unknown\(test set Z  Z 1 Z 2  Z k The decision function is given by F  x  w,x  b 5 where w and b are obtained using training set and F  x  is calculated for test set Based on the value of F  x   samples are classiìed using sign  F  x   The optimization problem consists of a loss and a regularization problem min w CL  w  y  R  w  6 i.e min w,b 1  2  w  2 2  C  i max\(0  1  y i  w,x i   b  7 Fig 3 Mapping into a higher dimension space for linear SVM classiìer If the input data is not linearly separable then it can be mapped to a higher dimensional space so that it becomes linearly separable as in gure 3 The function that maps the input data to a higher dimensional space is often referred to as kernel function k  X  X  R 8 Common kernel functions include radial basis function rbf polynomial kernel function\(poly sigmoid 36

algorithm which is an e xtension of AdaBoost algorithm is used for reweighing The feature representation transfer approach aims at nding good representation of the target domain The knowledge that is used to transfer is embedded in the feature representation that has been learnt The parameter transfer approach assumes that the already known model of the classes and the new model to be learnt have some common parameters so these parameters are transferred for modeling the new class The relational transfer approach assumes that the data is not independent and identically distributed and more than one relation can be used to represent them So it transfers the relation that is similar to both previously known class models and the new class data 3M ULTI K ERNEL T RANSFER L EARN ING The MKTL framework helps in learning a classiìer for a new class given only a few samples by making use of the already learnt classiìers for some different set of classes In it is assumed that the feature representation of the source and the target domain could be different and the modeling method could also be different Here we brieîy describe the MKTL as proposed in The MKTL model is meant for learning the classiìers for F  new classes given that the models for F classes apart from these F  classes are known The F classes are trained using some classiìer which is a function f  X  Z to predict the class to which a new test data belongs where X is the input feature space and Z 1  2   m given m classes The function f is given by f  x  arg max z  Z s p  x z  where x is the input feature vector and s p  x z  is the score function that denotes how conìdently the input x can be assigned to class z  If x i y i is the training set for the F  classes where x i s are the feature vectors and y i s the corresponding labels then the prior knowledge is obtained as the score function as predicted by the models of the F known classes i.e s p  x i z   z 1  2   F  So for the new class the score function is given by s  x y   w     x y  14 Fig 5 Score of a new class sample using prior knowledge models s  x y   w 0  0  x y  z  F  z 1 w  y,z     y,z   s p  x z  y  15 where w    is a hyperplane and          X  Y  H maps the input data into a higher dimensional space w  0 in the above equation represents the model parameters corresponding to  0  x y  which is the feature mapping function for input features x  Also w  y,z  represents the weightage assigned to the z-th prior model while predicting the input x as belonging to new class y where y 1  2  3   F   The optimization problem can be posed as nding the vector  w that minimizes the following min  w   w  C N  i 1 l   w  x i y i  16 where   w is the regularizer to avoid overìtting and can be given by   w  1  2   w  2 2 p 17 where  w  w 0  w 1  1   w  y,z    w  F  F   l is the loss function which is a convex and nonnegative function and for the multiclass classiìca38

Fig 12 Output of the No Transfer Prior-feature and MKTL model using prbf kernel and NaiveBayes classiìer 6A PPLICATIONS With the increase in recognition accuracy of the MKTL framework it can be brought to use for object classiìcation in an automated video surveillance system Due to the unconstrained prior model and transfer learning approach requiring very few labeled samples for training this approach will be a step forward from the traditional machine learning approach when employed in a surveillance system 7F UTURE W ORK In future a more robust probabilistic model for the prior knowledge representation will lead to further improvement in the accuracy of the MKTL framework The MKTL framework can be tested with more datasets to generalize it for different types of data used for testing and training 8C ONCLUSION We compared the performance of the MKTL model using SVM and Naive Bayes classiìer which showed a wide gap between the two models performance with the former outperforming the later The reason is the Bayes assumption of the features being independent We also attempted at modifying the Multi Kernel Transfer Learning framework by using prbf kernel instead of rbf kernel which turned out to be better representation of image features for obtaining the prior knowledge The proposed change has improved the recognition accuracy of the system by about 15 This has been possible by making use of the fact that the better the kernel function can map an input data into a higher dimensional space the better is the efìciency of the SVM classiìer R EFERENCES  Luo Jie T atiana T ommasi and Barbara Caputo Multiclass transfer Learning From Unconstrained Priors IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision ICCV  November 2011  F  R Bach G.R.G Lanckriet and M I Jordan Multiple k ernel learning conic duality and the SMO algorithm ICML  2004  P  Gehler and S No w ozin On feature combination for multiclass object classiìcation ICCV  2009  C H Lampert H.Nickisch and S Harmeling Learning to detect unseen object classes by between-class attribute transfer CVPR  2009  T  T ommasi F  Orabona and B Caputo Safety in numbers Learning categories from few exampleswith multi model knowledge transfer CVPR  2010  Ashraf A E A Zanaty  and Said Ghoniemy  Impro ving the classiìcation accuracy using support vector machines SVMs with new kernels Journal of Global Research in Computer Science JGRCS  February 2013  Sinno Jialin P a n and Qiang Y ang  A Surv e y on T ransfer Learning IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering  October 2010  Herbert Bay  T inne T uytelaars and Luc V a n Gool Surf Speeded up robust features ECCV Conference  2006  Ashesh Jain T utorial on SVM and Multi K ernel Learning MKL Internet:http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in  ee5070403 Tutorial.pdf Aug 25 2011 Oct 1  F  Orabona L Jie and B Caputo,çOnline-batch strongly convex multi kernel learning CVPR  2010  D G Lo we Object recognition from local scale in v ariant features ICCV  1999  Y a n K e Rahul Sukthankar  PCA-SIFT  A More Distincti v e Representation for Local Image Descriptors CVPR 2004  Qiang Y ang Introduction to T ransfer Learning Internet http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/conf/MLA07/ìles/YangQ.pdf 2007[Oct 1  Hill T  and Le wicki StatSoft Inc 2013 Electronic Statistics Textbook Tulsa OK StatSoft WEB http://www.statsoft.com textbook Oct 1  Na vneet Dalal and Bill T riggs,çHistograms of oriented gradients for human detection CVPR  2005  Sarfraz S Hell wich O.,çHead Pose Estimation in F ace Recognition across pose scenarios Proceedings of VISAPP Int conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications  2008  Krystian Mik olajczyk and Cordelia Schmid  A performance evaluation of local descriptors IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence  2005  W e n yuan Dai Qiang Y ang Gui-Rong Xue and Y ong Y u  Boosting for transfer learning Proceedings of the 24th international conference on Machine learning ICML  2007 41

   10   Figure 12:  Infrared Image of a Panel during Test   Figure 13:  Final LADEE Test   6  M AINTENANCE   I NSPECTION   AND R EPAIR  Receiving Inspection  Beyond testing, the LADEE team used tried and true methods of visual inspection and record keeping from receipt through launch.  The panel vendor accompanied the initial delivery of hardware to NASA ARC and participated in an on site inspection, thereby do cumenting the initial state of the hardware.  Throughout during Integration and Test \(I&T\, the LADEE test team performed their own visual inspections of the hardware.  This best practice resulted in the discovery of two panels with minor damage  Launch Site Inspection  Following shipment to the launch facility \(NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia\, the manufacturer performed an on site inspection and repair of the panels.  Roughly 15% of the array was found to have minor cracks and damage due to  handling \(Figure 14\.  During an extended stay at Wallops Island, the repair team was able to fix all affected panels with no issues \(Figure 15\.  The simplicity, portability, and ease of operation of the lamp test fixture made it easy to re evaluate all repaired panels prior to launch.  Note the inspections and final test were not part of the project\222s original \(observatory LAPSS test\ plan   Figure 14:  Damaged LADEE Solar Cell   Figure 15:  Cell Repair at the Launch Facility   7  M ISSION O PERATIONS  A ma jor assumption that enabled the entire risk mitigation process was the allocation of manufacturer\222s per panel LAPSS data for requirements verification, LADEE EPS modeling and mission operations tools.  Several factors can invalidate that assumption.  One obviously, is any damage and repair that could occur prior to launch.  Another is degradation; though LADEE is a short lifetime mission some level of radiation or micro meteorite damage will occur.  A final factor, shadowing, is less a function of the pan els themselves than the spacecraft geometry Protrusions in the spacecraft will tend to shadow portions of the array, and predicting that behavior can be extremely complex.  Neither the lamp test nor a LAPSS would completely account for shadowing.  All of  these factors feed into the need to continuously evaluate the health and performance of the solar array through mission operations  


   11 This would be relatively simple if the spacecraft\222s COTS avionics measured current from each panel, or even each switch.  Unfortunately this is not the case; only one measurement is made for the entire solar array system This design approach, while appropriate for a low complexity Class D system, is highly inconvenient for debugging any type of photovoltaic system failure   During Operational Readiness Training \(ORTs\, the LADEE EPS team developed a method to evaluate panel performance throughout the mission.  The approach illuminates the interdisciplinary nature and value of mission operations experience, even for the hardware designer.  In this case, the ORT campaign engendered collaboration between the EPS and Guidance, Navigation, and Control GNC\ teams that led to a solution.  The EPS team discovered that the GNC system design includes calculation and storage of the spacecraft sun vector as part of its attitude determination process.  As mentioned, the EPS subsystem records the solar array current and number of closed switches.  The EPS analysis tool simply combines the downlinked sun vector with the EPS data and a ge ometrical spacecraft model to determine an expected array current and the derived error \(Figure 16\.  Observation of the spacecraft over a combination of attitudes can be used to back out the behavior of individual panels, thereby updating the manufacture r\222s data   8  C ONCLUSIONS  The LADEE program applied true Class D risk tracking and mitigation techniques to address a major technical risk.  A project decision driven by resources, combined with redefinition of risk metrics, forced its staff to reconsider st andard practices and determine what was really necessary The process of test research development, execution, and risk closure took roughly 10 weeks \(Figure 5\.  The total cost was roughly 12% of the industry standard \(LAPSS solution in materials costs  and 12 labor hours per test Further, the theatre lamp approach is easy to train with and portable.  When combined with standard visual inspection it actually added value over the LAPSS approach in this application.  The test proved the system met powe r generation requirements 6 weeks prior to launch.  Post launch, interdisciplinary approaches proved useful to track performance of the array in flight.  Finally, the entire approach can be easily handed down to future missions   A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work  was performed under the direction of Joseph Camisa, who served as the LADEE EPS Lead until his retirement in mid 2013.  Additional notes of appreciation go to the NASA GSFC Power Group \(Code 563\, the Emcore inspection and repair staff, and the LADEE Syst ems Engineering, Project Management, and Integration and Test teams for their participation in this work        Figure 16 226 Mission Operations Tool Overlays Expected and Actual Generated Array Current
