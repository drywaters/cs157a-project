cost-effectiveness analysis of maintenance tasks within scheduled aircraft maintenance program development The paper is based on empirical studies of possible scenarios from aircraft failure to operational consequences in commercial airlines Empirical data was extracted through document studies and interviews guided by the application of an Event Tree Analysis ETA The analysis was performed together with experienced practitioners from both an aircraft manufacturer and commercial airlines which contributed to a continuous verification of the outcomes of the study The proposed methodology which is based on ETA is considered as a valuable support in the assessment of the 
operational consequences of failures within a MSG-3 framework The proposed methodology focuses on assessing the operational consequences of failures and associated economical losses Hence in order to enable an estimation of the maintenance tasks cost-effectiveness the methodology should be further developed to include a cost assessment of the applicable maintenance tasks The proposed methodology could be adapted as a support to those involved in the development of aircraft maintenance program The operational consequences and the probabilities of the proposed event tree can be quantified by the aid of historical data or expert judgment 
No other research paper or other available documentation dealing with the assessment of the cost of failures with operational consequences has been encountered by the authors Hence the proposed methodology fills this gap and provides a fulfillment of practitioners needs.12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION  1 2 THE ROLE OF FAILURE CONSEQUENCES IN MAINTENANCE TASK SELECTION  2 3 TYPES OF FAILURE AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES.3 4 OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURES 4 5 CURRENT PRACTICES IN AIRCRAFT LINE MAINTENANCE   5 6 STUDY

to customers has become a strategic issue However the airline business is large complex automated and integrated which mean that the consequences of failures are critical and include a high cost for system maintenance loss of productivity incidents and exposure to accidents It can also lead to annoyance inconvenience and a lasting customer dissatisfaction that can play havoc with the responsible organization's marketplace position Some of the above-mentioned consequences are due to unplanned corrective maintenance which are potentially harmful to the normal schedule of the aircraft In fact one of today's 
most important concerns among both manufacturers and airlines is how to provide a more reliable service and how to manage the consequences of unreliability which results from many different causes and which ultimately will results in aircraft unavailability One approach for achieving a good availability performance is to eliminate or minimize the probability of failures by designing the aircraft system with a high reliability performance Another approach is to design the aircraft with a good maintainability performance which means that it is easy to retain or restore the required 
functions of the aircraft and thereby reduce the consequences of failures A third approach for affecting the availability performance of an aircraft positively is to have a good maintenance support performance i.e a maintenance organization that is both effective and efficient in retaining and restoring the required functions of the aircraft 1 The ability of the maintenance organization to upon demand provide the required resources to maintain the aircraft is related to the aircraft itself the conditions under which it is used and the maintenance policy The maintenance policy 1 


describes the interrelationship between the echelons of the maintenance organization the indenture levels of the aircraft and the set of maintenance tasks to be applied on the aircraft The set of maintenance tasks to be carried out on different indenture levels of the aircraft are stated in the scheduled maintenance program 1 Preventive Maintenance PM tasks in a scheduled maintenance program are carried out according to prescribed criteria or at predetermined intervals In fact the role of PM tasks in a scheduled maintenance program are to cope with the failure process proactively to be sure of a safe and reliable operation of the asset at the lowest possible cost PM avoids the problems associated with corrective maintenance so as to eliminate waste and reduce asset life cycle costs In general the aim of any PM is to prevent or eliminate failure to detect the onset of the failure or to discover hidden failure 2 3 Sometime complete failure prevention might not be feasible In this case the aim would be to reduce the risk of failure to an acceptable level for the user or to mitigate the consequences of failure PM schemes are performed in the belief that they will improve component utilization In order to develop an effective and efficient scheduled maintenance program Reliability-Centered Maintenance RCM was introduced within the American aviation industry in the 1970s RCM is a systematic methodology used to identify the PM tasks necessary to realize the inherent reliability of equipment at lowest possible cost 4 The RCM methodology contains systematic decision logic for identification of the PM actions that are necessary to manage the failure modes that are causing functional failures in a given operating context The objective of RCM is to define maintenance tasks that are applicable and effective with respect to the type of failure and its associated consequences 5 6 By the combined efforts of the aircraft manufacturers regulatory authorities operators and the Air Transport Association of America ATA principles of RCM were implicitly incorporated into the MSG-3 methodology to justify task development 7 In the commercial aviation industry increasing emphasis is now being placed on using the MSG-3 methodology The reason is that it is a common means of compliance to develop minimum scheduled maintenance requirements in the frame of the instructions for continued airworthiness promulgated by most of the regulatory authorities In fact MSG-3 is a methodology to implement the RCM philosophy in the aviation sectors According to RCM if a failure does not have safety consequences3 the corresponding maintenance task must be cost-effective This means that the cost of performing the maintenance task must be less than the cost of the failure i.e the cost of operational loss and corresponding corrective maintenance 6 Though for failures with operational consequences the MSG-3 methodology requires that the task must reduce the risk of failure to an acceptable level However in order to assess the amount of risk reduction the total associated operational losses due to failure should be considered also in MSG-3 analysis Therefore assessment of expected operational consequences of the failure is an essential input for a cost-effective analysis However during the development of an initial maintenance program for a new aircraft the quantification and assessment of the cost of operational consequences is a great challenge This is due to a long list of uncertainties related to the large number of contributory factors inadequacy of service information and a lack of understanding about their influence Hence the purpose of this paper is to describe a methodology that supports an assessment of the operational consequences of failures in aircraft systems and its associated costs in order to facilitate a correct and efficient decision-making during cost-effectiveness analysis of maintenance tasks within scheduled aircraft maintenance program development 2 THE ROLE OF FAILURE CONSEQUENCES IN MAINTENANCE TASK SELECTION Within RCM and consequently MSG-3 it is recognized that it is the failure consequence or failure effect MSG-3 terminology and not the failure itself that is the key issue for all maintenance decision Hence the purpose of any maintenance action is to eliminate or reduce the failure consequences to an acceptable level and not to avoid the failures per se 8 9 Hence regardless of the methodology that is used to design a maintenance program the prime concern is whether the selected maintenance task is fulfilling its objectives or not Moreover designing to meet economical requirements and achieving competitive operation in both private and public sector organizations depends on prudently balancing what is technically feasible and what is economically acceptable 10 Thus the selection of a maintenance task needs to be supported by overriding criteria to recognize the fulfillment of the maintenance task's objectives In summary the development of a scheduled maintenance program consists of determining which maintenance tasks that are both applicable technically feasible and effective worth doing 2 3 Evident operational/economical and hidden non-safety consequences 2 


A maintenance task is applicable if it eliminates a failure or reduces the probability of occurrence to an acceptable level 11 The effectiveness of a maintenance task is a measure of the fulfillment of the maintenance task objectives which also is dependent on the failure consequences 6 9 In other words the maintenance task's effectiveness is a measure of how well the task accomplishes the intended purpose and if it is worth doing  1 According to Rausand  Hoyland 12 to be effective a PM task must reduce an expected loss to an acceptable level These losses may include injuries to people e.g flight crew and passengers environmental impact e.g air and noise pollution production losses e.g flight cancellation and equipment damages e.g damaged hydraulic pump Therefore the consequences of failure determine the priority of the maintenance activities or design improvement required to prevent the failure 9 Following this concept it is possible to identify the maintenance objectives more explicitly and consequently to devise the best possible task to correct the failure 3 TYPES OF FAILURE AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES The effect of failure depends directly on both the nature of the function that fails and the nature of the failure Depending on the nature and state of failure it may be recognized by the crew during normal operation or remain unrecognized Hence the first issue to be ascertained when analyzing failures and their consequences is to determine if the failure is evident or not The loss of an item's basic function may be evident but in many cases the item will have secondary or other characteristic functions whose failure will not be evident to the operating crew In fact a failure that has a direct adverse affect on the operational capability including critical failures will always be evident to the operating crew If the effect of a failure is not observable this means that the loss of function has no immediate consequence Sometimes a single failure results in an undesirable consequence In other cases a combination of several failures i.e a multiple failure is required to result in undesirable consequences Hence in order to determine if a preventive maintenance task can reduce the undesirable consequences to an acceptable level it is necessary to know whether a single or a multiple failure should be prevented 5 Hence the first step when classifying a failure is to determine if it is evident or hidden A failure that by itself is obvious to the crew while they are performing their normal duties is classified as an evident failure All evident failures are analyzed as single failures On the other hand a failure that is not evident to the crew while performing their normal duties is classified as a hidden failure A combination of one hidden failure and another failure or event that makes the hidden failure evident is classified as a multiple failure 5 The classification of failures into hidden or evident is vital for the evaluation of protective devices since their functions and failures are not apparent in isolation Hidden failures that are analyzed as part of a multiple failure are those that have no undesirable consequence when they occur on their own In these cases the objective of a PM task is to prevent the consequences of multiple failures When either evident or hidden failures occur the user is concerned about how the failure affects safety operations or economics Hence the evident and hidden classes of failures are further divided into the following failure effect categories 1 3]4 evident safety evident operational evident economical hidden safety and hidden non-safety economical/operational Failure modes having safety consequences involve possible loss of the equipment and its occupants Operational consequences adversely affect the operating capability of system and involve an indirect financial loss due to operation repercussions Failure modes having economical consequences do not prevent equipment operation and may involve the additional costs linked to aspects such as higher fuel consumption quicker degradation of equipment and more expensive corrective maintenance Evident failures that affect the safety or the operating capability have an immediate operational impact since the aircraft cannot be dispatched until they have been corrected The rectification of evident economical failures and hidden failures may be postponed since necessary corrective maintenance can be deferred to a time and location that suits operation 9 Failures having safety consequences definitely affect operation which means that they also involve operational consequences Since these failures involve possible loss of the equipment and its occupants they ultimately cost money and thereby also have economical consequences Hence failures with safety consequences are a subset of those with operational consequences which in turn are a subset of failures with economical consequences Moreover failures with operational consequences involve an indirect economical loss due to operational interruptions such as delays or altitude restrictions e.g leading to higher fuel consumption and the direct cost of maintenance Hence failures with operational consequences are a subset of the failures with economical consequences In summary since 3 4 This IEC standard is based largely on the tried and tested procedures in MSG-3 as expressed in IEC 60300-3-1 1999 3 


all failures with safety or operational consequences cost money they are a subset of the failures with economical consequences The classes and severity of failure consequences are illustrated in Figure 1 The closer to the center of the circles the greater the severity of the failure However the criticality of the failure also depends on the frequency of occurrence which is not illustrated in the figure The treatment of failures depends on their consequences which means that is necessary to identify the failure consequences As common practice the failure should be classified according to its most severe consequences For example a failure with both safety and operational consequences must be classified as a failure with safety consequences Figure 1 The severity of failure effects 4 OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURES In this paper failure modes with operational consequences are defined as failure modes that might reduce the operating capability of the aircraft to meet the intended functionality and performance requirements in the application in which the aircraft is operated The effect of these failure modes interrupts the planned flight operations and interferes with the completion of the aircraft's mission where operational interruption is an event by which the rate and quality of flight production is seriously affected In scheduled airline operation the operational consequences can usually be expressed in terms of the inability to deliver services e.g to passengers in a timely fashion These events are potentially harmful to the normal scheduled operation of the aircraft which could lead to additional cost of operational irregularities cost of unplanned maintenance et cetera Operational interruption can also cause cumulative problems not only for the day of operations but also for future planning as it sometimes has reactionary domain effect In general failures affecting aircraft flight altitudes landing and flight distances maximum take-off weight high drag coefficients or the routine use of the aircraft are also considered to have an adverse effect on the operating capability These events may lead to consequences such as flight delays or cancellation In some cases the flight crew has to refer to the abnormal or the emergency crew check lists if the operating capability is affected Hence based on the different situations the adverse effects of a failure on the operating capability may require actions including o The correction of failure prior to further dispatch o The use of immediate operational procedure in flight o The imposition of operating restriction o The use of abnormal or emergency procedures by the flight crew In general the assessment of whether an aircraft is approved to continue its services with a specific type of failure detected requires a consultation of relevant documents such as the Minimum Equipment List MEL technical limitations and allowances and the operation manual These documents give some relevant information on how long the aircraft can fly with the existing failure and what the imputed restrictions or necessary actions that must be fulfilled in order to permit the aircraft to remain in service If the above mentioned documents allow the aircraft to remain in service and continue its normal operation with certain items inoperative GO items the failure will not have any operational consequence since the correction of the failure can be deferred to an appropriate time There are also situations where the MEL allows the aircraft to fly with certain items inoperative GO IF item However this might require some action before departure e.g the activation of a system This action will take time and might affect the flight In some other cases the aircraft might be operational with a failure present but it will reduce the operational capability and induce some operational restrictions It has to be noted that GO and GO IF items may introduce extra risk in case of additional failure in subsequent flights However a failure that requires immediate correction NO GO item does not necessarily interrupt regular operation For example if a failure in an aircraft system can be rectified during the normal transit time at a line station it 4 


causes no delay or cancellation of subsequent flights In this situation the only economical consequence is the cost of corrective maintenance This could be achieved by good reliability or maintainability characteristics e.g by equipment redundancy accessibility modular design Line Replacement Units LRU or Built-in Test BIT systems that enhance the trouble shooting procedure and rectification which reduces the maintenance downtime Moreover airlines policy and procedures training availability of required resources and level of maintenance practices highly contribute to decrease down time needed to rectify the failure during normal transit time Failures with operational consequences may cause different operational impact on ground or in the air The impact on ground may include delays related to flight dispatch ground turn-back back to gate aborted take-off aircraft substitution and flight cancellation The impact in air may include in-flight turn-back diversion go around touch and go and re-routing All of these consequences result in direct financial losses mostly due to the additional unexpected costs related to the o Flight crew e.g extra flight labor substitution of crews by stand-by crews crew overtime and hotel o Ramp and airport e.g additional cost of ground equipment and gate staff overtime and airport fees o Aircraft itself e.g depreciation associated fuel burnt cost extra aircraft utilization and maintenance charges navigation charges and aircraft substitution o Passengers e.g penalties and compensations rerouting of passengers luggage complaints hotel refreshments transportation and possible loss of revenue if the interruption leads to flight cancellation These consequences also result in some indirect economical losses mostly due to customer dissatisfaction passenger illwill and loss of opportunity i.e the inability to use the aircraft as planned Moreover it sometimes has reactionary domain effects and could cause cumulative problems not only for the day of operations but also for future planning All of the mentioned consequences involve economical losses in addition to the cost of the maintenance necessary to correct the failure The magnitude of the operational consequences of a particular failure mode depends mostly on the type and nature of the failure the phase of flight operation in which the failure occurs e.g prior to dispatch taxi take-off climb cruise descent approach and landing and the expected time duration for the rectification of the failure e.g less than 15 minutes more than one hour et cetera It also depends on the size and type of the aircraft the management policy of the operating airline and its maintenance support system Therefore developing a universal model for assessing the cost of the operational consequences of a failure is difficult and includes large uncertainties 5 CURRENT PRACTICES IN AIRCRAFT LINE MAINTENANCE Aircraft failures are classified according to deferrable or non-deferrable items Failures that are related to deferrable items are those that are non-critical with regard to aircraft safety i.e the aircraft can continue its normal flight with the failure present 14 If the time limited failure is not corrected within the allowed time the aircraft is no longer in airworthy condition and thus can be grounded by national authority Hence airlines set goals for the allowed number and type of deferrals for each particular type of aircraft Once a failure is corrected it will be taken off the list of deferrals In general if any failure happens on the ground i.e prior to dispatch the pilot reports the failure by means of a pilot report pireps in the aircraft technical logbook which requests the maintenance engineers to correct the problems Maintenance engineers perform a troubleshooting based on the pireps to fix the problem In this case the assessment of whether a failure is deferrable or not requires consultation of the Minimum Equipment List MEL The MEL grants allowances to fly with certain items inoperative if the loss of function does not affect safety and depending on the item it may invoke additional limitations or time limits before maintenance must be performed For example if the radar is out it is acceptable to take-off as long as the radar will not be required for that flight A close examination of the weather along the planned route will answer that question Another example is the engine anti-ice system which is not a particularly essential system in non-icing conditions If the MEL document allows the aircraft to remain in service with certain items inoperative GO items only and the pilot accepts to fly in this situation the correction of the failure will be deferred to a proper time Hence the failure will not have any operational consequence as the necessary maintenance will be postponed GO IF items also may have operational consequence linked to MEL consultation and maintenance action like inhibition/flight preparation Hence the flight crew will initiate boarding procedures and the aircraft will take-off 5 It establishes the aircraft equipment allowed to be inoperative under certain conditions for a specific type of aircraft with an acceptable level of safety The MEL contains the conditions limitations and procedures required for operating the aircraft with these items inoperative 5 A Minimum Equipment List MEL is an approved document created specifically to regulate the dispatch of an aircraft type with inoperative equipment 


In some situation the MEL allows deferring the required maintenance and the aircraft to fly with certain items inoperative GO items but it imposes some type of operational restrictions such as reduced speed altitude restriction or a restriction on the use of specific systems In these cases the aircraft may be operational with a certain type of failures but its operational capability is reduced which results in increased operating costs primarily due to increased flying distance or fuel consumption There are situations where the MEL allows the aircraft to fly with certain items inoperative but it requires the maintenance crew to do some preliminary action such as activation or deactivation of a system GO IF This takes time to implement and might affect the regularity of flight operation In some other case the aircraft might be operational with a certain type of failure present but as its operational capability is reduced it requires some operational restriction This might in turn result in additional operating costs mostly due to high fuel consumption or increased flight time See Figure 2 CheckELstatusl Yes I Figure 2 Unscheduled maintenance and MEL Minimum Equipment List consultation procedure maintenance engineers perform troubleshooting based on the pireps as mentioned above In some other cases that failures affect the flight requires the pilot to take some action with consultation of the FM FCOM QRH or making use of his/hers experience In these cases either some operational restriction may be necessary or continued aircraft operation is prohibited since the failure requires immediate maintenance Depending on the phase of flight during which the failure occurs the latter situation may require the pilot to perform return to gate aborted take-off in-flight turn-back or diversion to another airport than the planned one If the aircraft is in landing mode the occurrence of a sudden failure in some systems may reduce the capability of the aircraft to complete the landing mission Hence in some situations the pilot may perform a touch-and-go 6 STUDY APPROACH A literature review was performed to find available methodologies and models that support the assessment of the cost of failures with operational consequences within the aviation industry However no systematic methodology or model for this purpose has been identified Fortunately there are systematic methodologies for reliability and risk management available as well as some studies of the cost of airborne and ground delays of passenger aircraft In order to illustrate the operational consequences of aircraft failure the Event Tree Analysis ETA was chosen as an appropriate methodology One major reason for this selection was that the supporting tool i.e the event tree can be applied in order to illustrate the combination of events leading to ultimate operational consequences Cause-Consequence Model of Failures The process of a failure begins with a set of basic events which are known as initiating events that perturb the system 20 If the initiating event cannot be managed at an early stage of occurrence it will lead to a number of so called undesired events See Figure 3 If the failure occurs while the aircraft is in flight the assessment of whether necessary crew procedure is deferrable or not requires a consultation of the Flight Manual FM Flight Crew Operating Manual FCOM Quick Reference Handbook QRH and the pilot's experience Ultimately two different scenarios may occur if the failure is recognized in relation to a flight i.e either the failure has an effect on the operating capability or not If the failure does not affect to the flight the pilot normally reports the failure by means of a pilot report pireps in the aircraft technical logbook When the aircraft arrives at the next airport the In RCM analysis the initiating events which are the initial cause of failure are known as failure modes and are defined as the specific physical condition or state that causes a particular functional failure Failure modes represent the primary focus of the RCM analysis 5 This might include human errors e.g over loading of equipment failures of a technical item e.g rupture of an 0-ring or maybe environmental impact e.g corrosion or unexpected high ambient temperature For RCM purpose undesired events are considered as failures RCM further defines failure as any identifiable deviation from the original condition that is unsatisfactory to the user 6 


As Figure 3 shows a failure is naturally the start of a possible undesired consequence In this context the term consequence is defined in a very broad sense including all events causing any type of loss The loss or unexpected consequence to be considered may include injury or loss of life air and noise pollution high repair cost loss of system or equipment delay or flight cancellation et cetera see Figure 3 RCM can be seen as a reliability and risk management methodology since it aims at reducing the rate at which failures occur and faults are present as well as reducing or mitigating possible consequences Furthermore RCM as well as other general approaches to reliability and risk management includes the identification of hazards the objects that could be harmed and also the current controls for reducing the frequency or consequence of unwanted events The most important part of risk analysis is risk identification Only those risks that have been identified can be managed in a systematic and conscious way However identification is not enough cf the discussion in 15 There is also a need for action using risk evaluation to take appropriate operation and maintenance decisions regarding risk reduction and control thus ensuring that the system stays in a safe state regarding both technical and organizational parts 16 In order to achieve above mentioned discussion RCM analysis seeks to identify maintenance tasks that will prevent the consequences that result when failure modes are allowed to occur 5 In this regard one important support to the RCM analysis is the Failure Mode  Effects Analysis FMEA methodology which aims at determining possible Undesired   Basic event events e.g failure mode e.g failure system states under the assumption of the presence of certain failures Other well-known inductive methodologies for risk identification are Preliminary Hazards Analysis PHA Hazard  Operability Studies HAZOP and Event Tree Analysis ETA The basic events are often identified and modeled by fault tree analysis If failure rate and other necessary data are available for the basic events the fault tree analysis will provide estimates of the frequency of occurrence of the various undesired events see Figure 3 17 The possible consequence chains starting from an undesired event are often identified and modeled by ETA see Figure 3 Depending on the type of failure the outcome of the ETA will be a set of possible consequences such as delay high repair cost or injury to the people or loss of life If necessary input data are available for the barriers and physical models the ETA will provide frequencies or probabilities of the various consequences Event Tree Analysis ETA ETA can be used for qualitative as well as quantitative reliability and risk analyses 18 19 20 ETA is widely used for facilities provided with engineering accident mitigating features in order to identify the sequences of events which lead to the occurrence of specified consequences following the occurrence of an initiating event It is appropriate to apply an ETA in case where the successful operation of a system depends on an approximately chronological but discrete operation of its subsystems e.g subsystems should work in a defined sequence for operational success 20 or when there are a Fault Tree Analysis FTA Event Tree Analysis ETA Figure 3 Cause-consequence model of failure adapted from 17 7 


number of safety functions or barriers affecting the outcomes of the initiating event 19 The event tree is a commonly used graphical tool supporting the ETA methodology The event tree is traditionally a horizontally built structure that starts on the left with what is known as initiating event The initiating event may describe a situation where a legitimate demand for the operation of a system occurs The development of the tree proceeds chronologically with the requirement on each subsystem being postulated The first subsystem requirement appears initially on top of the tree structure in the event tree headings 20 The event trees are usually developed in a binary format e.g the events are assumed to either occur or not occur or to be either a success or a failure 21 At a branch point the upper branch of an event usually shows the success of the event and the lower branch its failure Hence certain subsystems may not be necessary given the occurrence of some preceding events However there may also be cases where a spectrum of outcomes is possible in which situation the branching can proceed with more than two outcomes 20 The probabilities in an event tree are conditional probabilities i.e the probability of a subsequent event is not the probability obtained from tests under general conditions but the probability of the event under the conditions arising from the chain of preceding events 21 The outcome of each sequence of events or path is illustrated at the end of each sequence This outcome describes the final outcome of each sequence whether the overall system succeeds fails initially succeeds but fails at a later time or something else The logical representation of each sequence of the event tree can also be shown in the form of a Boolean expression The logical representation of each event tree heading and ultimately each event tree sequence is obtained and then reduced through the use of Boolean algebra rules If an expression explaining all failed states is desired the sum of the reduced Boolean expressions for each sequence that leads to failure should be obtained and reduced However if the branching of the event tree has more than two outcomes the qualitative representation of the branches in the Boolean sense is not possible The quantitative evaluation of event trees is straightforward and similar to the quantitative evaluation of fault trees 20 7 PROPOSED EVENT TREE ANALYSIS ETA Depending on the situation in which a failure occurs the integration of the following criteria drives the ultimate state of the operational situation and the deviation from its normal state that leads to the possible operational consequences o the possibility of detection of loss of functions by operating crew in terms of evident or hidden failure and its detectability during normal operation of aircraft o the nature of the failure in terms of adverse affect on operating capability o the possibility to dispatch an aircraft with an item inoperative o the possibility to continue a flight with an inoperative item o the phase of the flight in which the failure occurs and o the pilot's decision In fact the combination of these criteria determines the extent to which operational action is required to keep the aircraft in operation or if needed to be restored to its normal operating state immediately This may include immediate maintenance action prior to dispatch or it might be necessary to consider operational restrictions such as reduced flight altitude It may also be necessary to follow emergency or abnormal procedures such as aborted take-off in flight turn-back diversion or touch-and-go when aircraft is airborne Based on the above discussions two different types of criteria have been identified that are displayed in the proposed event tree the operational phase where failure occurs and the effect of failure on operating capability The first criterion includes the five different states that indicate the operational phase where the failure occurs i.e prior to dispatch take-off climb cruise and approach and landing In each state two different events may occur either the failure occurs or not A Yes means that the failure occurs during the operational phase while No means that the failure does not occur during the specific operational phase See Figure 4 The second criterion includes three different states which indicate the extent to which the failure affects the operating capability of the aircraft The first state indicates the situation where the failure requires some immediate action to be taken e.g performing corrective maintenance or to follow some specified operational procedures Hence Yes means that the failure does not have any immediate effect on the operating capability i.e required corrective maintenance could be deferred However No means that an immediate action is required i.e the required corrective maintenance or operational procedure is not deferrable 8

The second state describes the need to impose any operational restrictions which are mandated by procedures or by pilot decision Hence No means no operational restrictions while a Yes means that some operational restrictions are necessary Finally the third state describes whether some emergency or abnormal operation is applied which is mandated by procedures or by pilot decision Here Yes means that emergency or abnormal operation must be applied while No means that an emergency or abnormal procedure is not necessary Both criteria are related to the failure and function characteristics which are given as input to the ETA One presumption is that only failure effects with possible operational or economic consequences according to MSG-3 should be included in the analysis The failure characteristics also include the rate of occurrence which will affect the outcome of the analysis The characteristics of the failure will also advice whether the occurrence of failure will be recognized by the crew or not As standard design practice if the failure has any operational consequences it should be evident to the crew The combination of different events Yes or No within the states of the two criteria operational phase and operating capability will create different scenarios that in turn will determine the ultimate operational consequences Based on the possible combination of events 25 different scenarios were identified which will lead to the following classification of consequences no operational consequence airborne and/or ground delays and emergency or abnormal operation Out of the 25 different scenarios that were identified there are six scenarios with no operational consequences One of these scenarios is when the failure never occurs i.e scenario 25 The other five scenarios where no operational consequences occur are where the failure's associated maintenance is deferrable and there are no necessary operational or abnormal restrictions i.e scenarios 2 6 11 16 and 21 Hence the only difference between these five scenarios is the operational phase where the failure occurs There are 14 event scenarios where the consequences are some sort of delay i.e scenarios 1 3 4 5 8 9 10 13 14 15 18 19 20 and 24 Out of these there are five scenarios where the operational consequences are manifested as only airborne delay i.e scenarios 1 5 10 15 and 20 These scenarios are related to the occurrence of a failure that is related to deferrable items but that requires some operational restrictions Abnormal procedures contribute to operational consequences in scenarios 7 12 17 and 22 All these scenarios are related to failures with non-deferrable items that have some sort of operational restrictions and necessitates emergency and abnormal procedures by the flight crew The main difference between the scenarios is the phase of flight where the failure occurs In scenarios 7 and 12 the failure occurs prior to dispatch or during takeoff respectively The two scenarios 17 failure occurs during cruise and 22 failure occurs during approach and landing result in diversion Also there are situations such as scenario 23 in which the aircraft is in landing mode and the occurrence of a sudden failure in some systems may reduce the capability of the aircraft to complete the landing mission Hence the pilot may perform a touch and go 8 ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED ETA In order to illustrate the proposed ETA and to demonstrate the application of the constructed event tree an Avionic Ventilation System AVS of a hypothetical twin-engine single aisle aircraft has been selected The associated data were gathered from particular airlines and then altered for confidentiality reasons to represent typical scenarios Avionic Ventilation System A VS The AVS is used to cool different avionics equipment AVS comprises different components such as computer blower extract fan sensors filter and valves One of the most important functions of the AVS computer is to control the AVS system's valves to open and close and fans to turn on or off The skin air inlet valve is installed in the fuselage skin to provide an outdoor air supply gateway for AVS on the ground see Figure 5 Figure 5 on the ground the valve is 10 _10 Fan Skin air inlet valve schematic diagram This valve is electrically operated but i Filter Air flow Valve can be manually overridden When the aircraft is 


fully open and in flight the valve is fully closed One of the functional failures which might occur with an AVS system could be defined as Skin Air Inlet Valve fails to close at take-off power setting Taking off with the Skin Air Inlet valve open instead of closed damages the avionics ventilation ducts and may have potential effects on both cabin pressurization and degradation of avionics ventilation performance If the valve is not function properly at take-off power setting prior to take-off a warning message appears on the cockpit display unit so that cockpit crew will be aware of the fault prior to take-off Therefore the conditional probability of detection of failure prior to take-off is 100 see Figure 6 This failure has no catastrophic or safety effect on the aircraft and its occupants However in order to avoid associated effect on cabin pressurization issues and to protect damage to the system the MEL advises that the valve should be closed manually on the ground and the related electrical connection should be isolated This is an immediate action which is required to fly with an inoperative Skin Air Inlet Valve within a certain limited time without any operational restrictions see Figure 6 Therefore the aircraft has to be returned to the ramp/gate so that the maintenance crew can perform these actions before further dispatch Hence this failure is classified as an evident failure with operational effect Based on the proposed ETA the only possible scenario is number 4 which results in the operational consequence Ground delay at departure see Figure 6 In order to quantify the rate at which operational consequences occur the frequency of failure failure rate or intensity should be multiplied by both the conditional probability of occurrence of this failure in different operational phases states 1.1 to 1.5 and the conditional probability of adverse affect of the failure on the operation capability states 2.1 to 2.3 This may be expressed as in Equation 1 The failure rate of Skin air inlet valve fails to close at take-N 1 2 3 4 S inariret vaKefailstD dcs 1 2 1 iec.lity  eah phaseofflight 1.4 Cuse 15 lArcax h  Ii adrg 2 Efedof failueon opering apability 2.1 Ddab 22 23 1 p e U6rng aFerabcn abromni restricicrn prcecdre Ria ID Takedfl 0imb takeoff Yeslow_ 260\260\260 Oocunof failure during 0 ca 0 a 0 Oper.iornl Cancieia m Ar1xmeclde I Nbcperaicnnipat I A rbcrnecblay Grardcalja 4 daeLre I G I_dddajdt"I I Figure 6 Proposed ETA of the hypothetical AVS system K Annual cost of scenario per aircraft Aircraft/year Rate of occurrence of each operational consequence scenario K Rate of occurrencj of scenario per FH Failure rate X Unit cost of ground delay al departure per FH x Conditional probability of states in criteria 1 x Conditional probability of states in criteria 2 t Duration Average annua2 X of delay X utilization X J 0 J 0 FH/yearJ 2 Quantity Per Aircraft QPA 2 11 11 1.2 1.3 


off power setting is 1 12e-5 per Flight Hour FH based on historical data The conditional probability of states in criteria 1 prior to take-off is estimated to 100 as the failure will be evident to the crew prior to take-off The conditional probability of states in criteria 2 nondeferrable with no operational restriction is estimated to 100 as the failure is not deferrable and it does not impose any operational restrictions as the aircraft is not allowed to take-off with the failure present according to the MEL Hence the rate of occurrence of scenario number 4 for AVS is 1.12e 5 per FH X 100 X I100  1.12e 5 per FH The outcome of the ETA on the hypothetical AVS system and the applicable values for each probability which has been gathered from historical data and expert opinions is shown in Figure 6 In order to estimate the cost of associated consequences standard average cost can be used for different operational consequences which normally are provided by the manufacturer or airlines For this specific case i.e scenario number 4 the assumptions made are displayed in Table 1 as advised by experienced practitioners Table 1 Cost Figures of some Type of Operational Consequences Consequences Magnitude Cost Long more than 30 min 70 min Ground delay Short less than 30 min 30 min Long more than 30 min 58 min Airborne delay Short less than 30 min 28 min The annual total cost for each consequence scenario for whole aircraft could be estimated in accordance with Equation 2 Hence the annual cost of scenario number 4 considering 3,000 FH of utilization per year is estimated to 1.12e per FH x 60 min/60 lhr delay time x 70 min x 60 min  420 hr x 3,000 FH year x QPA 1 The proposed methodology could also be adapted as a support for cost-effectiveness analysis of candidate maintenance tasks during the development of aircraft maintenance programs However the analysis documentation also constitutes an important part of the knowledge base which is also useful for design operation and maintenance of the aircraft In order to implement the proposed methodology and achieve valuable results accurate and sufficient data and information are needed as input data for the analysis This information is related to the technical system and its reliability e.g failure modes and their frequency of occurrence and maintainability performances e.g Built-in Test Equipment modularization and Line Replaceable Units Other information that is needed is related to aircraft operation and associated procedures given in formal documents such as the MEL FM FCOM and QRH Also information about the maintenance support performance is necessary The operational consequences and the probabilities of different events included in the proposed event tree can be quantified by the aid of historical data or expert judgments However an exact quantification and assessment of the cost of operational consequences of failures is a challenge due to a long list of influencing factors and inadequacy of required information One example is the challenge to determine a good estimation of the failure rate which requires the collection of data from the world fleet This collection of data is difficult since removal data do not necessarily imply a failure or since subsequent test level has difficulties to duplicate test results achieved at preceding test levels i.e no fault found events Another reason is that even if there is a failure it is not always possible to link the reported failure to the functional failure or failure mode identified in the MSG-3 analysis When there is a lack of historical data expert judgments can be a good source of information To support an effective extraction of the field experts knowledge there are systematic methodologies available e.g pair wise comparison 14.14 aircraft/year 9 DISCUSSION The scenario descriptions using the event trees give a detailed picture of the possible operational consequences of different failures in aircraft system during operation Hence the proposed methodology is considered as a valuable support in the assessment of the operational consequences of failures 12
