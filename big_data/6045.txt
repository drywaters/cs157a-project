1  Big Data as an e-Health Service Dr. W. Liu School of Science and Technology Georgia Gwinnett College Dr. E.K. Park VP for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies California State University - Chico Abstract  Big Data is transforming healthcare business an d ultimately society itself, as e-Health becomes one of key driving factors during the innovation process.   We investi gate BDeHS Big Data e-Health Service\ to fulfill the Big Data applications in the e-Health service domain.  In this paper we e xplain why the existing Big Data technologies such as Hadoop MapReduce, STORM and the like cannot be simply appl ied to e-Health services directly  We then describe the a dditional capabilities as required in order to make Big Data services for e-Health become practical  Next we report our desi gn of the BDeHS architecture that supplies data operation man agement capabilities regulatory compliance and e-Health m eaningful usages  Keywords Big Data Technologies e-Health Solutions  Big Data as a Service Service Support Infrastructure e-Health Data Operation Management; Regulatory Compliance  I   I NTRODUCTION  Digital healthcare solutions have promised to trans form the whole healthcare process to become more efficie nt less expensive and higher quality[1~8   I n  t h e  c o n t e x t  o f eHealth  numerous flows have generated slightly les s than 1,000 peta bytes of data now and may reach about 1 2 ZBs by 2020 in our own estimates\ from various sources such as electronic medical records \(EMR\ systems, mobilized health records MHR  personal health records  PHR mob ile health care monitors genetic sequencing and predic tive analytics as well as a large array of biomedical se nsors and smart devices The electronic medical record EMR initiative has resulted data streams from all types of patients at  the hospital insurance companies and doctorís office A single patient stay generates thousands of data elements including diagnoses, procedures, medications, medical supplie s, digital image lab results and billing These need to be va lidated processed and integrated into a large data pools to  enable meaningful analysis   Multiplying this by all the patientstays across the health processing systems and comb ining it with the large number of points where data is gener ated and stored and the scope of the big data challenge begi ns to emerge Outside the care provider facilities external heal th data are patient generated including social media self quantification including use of smartphones/wearabl e sensor information on patients heart rate brain activity  sleep patterns temperature muscle motion and numerous other clinically useful data points high-throughput and  systemwide measurement systems of many biological body pa rts and their states as well as other health-related i nformation being carried among associates parties of insurance  government reporting and so on  Additional externa l data are in the e-Health communication and support infra structure sources including the National Health Information N etwork NHIN Health Information Exchanges HIE Health Information Organizations HIO and Regional Health  Information Organizations \(RHIO As sources and volume of information increase so w ill expectations in utilizing those large volume of e-H ealth data to reduce costs, boost outcomes and improve treatme nt.

They hav e to be treated as semi-structured data as far as end-to end system flows are concerned   A patient-support system can gather store and deli ver medical information e.g electronic patient and medical records to patients and doctors remotely including medical history allergies vaccinations  appointments, and invoices as well as inquiry suppo rts Inside the vendor systems there are no guarantees that all data sets are standard compliant   A clinical-support system can gather, store and ret rieve patient medical information for internal use by physicians and healthcare workers delivering servic es at the point of care. The admin and supervisory person nel can have access to backend processing of resources  insurance claims and billings.  A number of exchang ed networks have been under development to ensure user level standards  But the system level data have no t been standardized   A research-portal system can gather store and anal yze patient medical information used by researchers and for government Centers for Disease Control reporting. T he research systems also support new scientific discoveries in seeking better disease management regimes and monitoring public health.  The informat ion will be fed into future e-Healthcare application developments   A national health information network 20  g e n e r a t e s communicational data about the underlying communication session functions  Some of the interfaces are standardized by NHIN and data flows could be well recognized   An operational environment to implement policy and security functions as well as usage accounting/char ging functions 21  i s  e s s e n t i a l  t o  h a n d l e  t h e  p e r f o r m a n ce data in order to meet the overall operational management functional requirements including QoS benchmarks, security audit trails and tracking logs  B  Big Data Solutions and Products Big Data research requires knowledge about standard s filters, meta-data, techniques for storing, finding analyzing visualizing and securing data, and sector-specific editing of data The predominant current technologies include MapReduce, Hadoop, STORM and alike with combination s or extensions 1  STORM Storm is a free and open source distributed realtim e computation system 23   S t o r m  m a k e s  i t  e a s y  t o  r e l iably process unbounded streams of data. Storm can be use d with any programming language usually Java but also Py thon and others as well  Storm integrates with the mes sage queuing and database technologies A Storm topology  consumes streams of data and processes those stream s in arbitrarily complex ways, repartitioning the stream s between each stage of the computation however needed.  Stor m may achieve processing of over a million tuples process ed per second per node as necessary for e-Health global fl ows To do realtime computation on Storm a topology i s created which is a graph of computation Each node  in a topology contains processing logic, and links betwe en nodes indicate how data should be passed around between n odes  Figure 2.  Illustration of STORM Architecture Storm can integrate with any source of message queuing and database connections  It can also gene rate its

Hapoop Processing Systems Hadoop scales across a small cluster to large clust ers A small Hadoop cluster will include a single master  and multiple worker nodes The master node consists of a JobTracker TaskTracker NameNode and DataNode A slave or worker node acts as both a DataNode and TaskTracker.   A name node contains the processing logics and a JobTracker server can manage job scheduling In clusters of the Hadoop where the MapReduce engine i s deployed against an alternate file system the Name Node secondary NameNode and DataNode architecture of the  HDFS in Hadoop are replaced by the file-system-spec ific equivalent Hadoop is used by many companies as a highperformance scalable and relatively low-cost optio n Vendors such as EMC IBM and Oracle have commercialized Hadoop, and aligned and integrated i t with the rest of their database and analytic offerings The batch processing nature allows e-Health informatics be pr ocessed off-line to generate reports and research discovery   But it cannot be directly used in real time to correlate t he e-Health data within the 15 seconds interval as shown in som e of Big Data research and development [25   3  MapReduce Hadoop was derived from Google's MapReduce and Google File System GFS papers 26  a n d  t h u s  i t  i s  important to understand the foundations to avoid re inventing the wheel in this regard MapReduce is a computational paradigm where the application is divided into mappers and reducers wh ich may be executed or re-executed on any node in the clust er In addition, it provides a distributed file system tha t stores data on the computing nodes providing very high aggrega te bandwidth across the cluster  It enables applicati ons to work with thousands of computation-independent comp uters and petabytes of data However for non-splitable compressed files such as e-Health DICOM image files, they may have to flow i nto a single mapper thus reducing the effectiveness of Bi d Data processing capability Additional tools have to be incorporated into the ecosystems.  Those tools in t urn have to be trained for e-Health files rules causing anot her layer of complexity Besides the technology limitations in each of speci fic Big Data foundation technologies or tool sets, the Big Data applications in health have focused too much on off line informatics.  In order to generate on-flight e-Heal th big-data services, QoS and service level agreements have to become a native support capability in the underlying e-Hea lth service infrastructure 4  Programing Tools Besides the general Big Data solution paradigms it  is worth mentioning the e-Health specific big data programming tools known as MUMPS 27   w h i c h  s t a n d s  for Massachusetts General Hospital Utility MultiProgramming System  MUMPS or simply M is a multi user strongly imperative language designed to mani pulate and control massive databases It is used in the hi gh availability, high reliability niche of the compute r market which includes banking and hospitals It provides s imple data abstractions in which all data values are str ings of characters and all data can be structured as multi ple dimensional arrays M data structures are sparse u sing strings of characters as subscripts M is itself a language combined with a database engine.    The application field of M is very specific to high demand and high performa nce databases that require support for sparse data 
984 


4  The initiative of deploying EHRs in all US hospital s now brings M programming into the mainstream  This  becomes a major enabler for mapping and flows of bi g data services   Further programming constructs are requ ired to develop key analytics algorithms to power many of t he big data applications collaborative filtering trend p rediction and anomaly detection  Algorithms include Dimensi on reduction curse of dimension nearest neighbor sea rch similarity search SVD singular value decomposit ion LSI Latent semantics indexing Random walk recur sive linear regression, and so on C  Additional e-Health \(Big Data\ Capabilities The BDeHS provides the services to access organize  and glean discoveries from huge volumes of e-Health digital data  In order to augment the Big Data foundations  to the ecosystems of e-Health we identify additional key capabilities necessary for BDeHS services 1  Data Federation and Aggregation The various types have been described in the previo us section and those sources reflect the fragmentatio n of eHealth data among the various stakeholders includi ng payers providers labs ancillary vendors data ve ndors standards organizations insurance institutions and  regulatory agencies Solutions for big data will br eak the traditional model in which all data is loaded into  a warehouse Data federation will emerge as a solutio n in which the big data architecture is based on a colle ction of nodes within and outside the enterprise and accesse d through a layer that integrates the data and analyt ics Additional central data collection points are emerg ing as HIE, RHIO and NHIN work to facilitate the exchan ge of healthcare data 2  Security and Regulatory Concerns This is the most fundamental requirements that distinguish the Big Data services for e-Health  Th ey deal with additional challenges such as privacy securi ty and legal concerns as well as questions about authenti city accuracy and consistency The entire healthcare system can realize benefits f rom democratizing big data access and the cloud 2  m a k es exposing and sharing big data easy and relatively inexpensive However significant security and priv acy concerns exist including the Health Insurance Port ability and Accountability Act HIPAA A credentialing pro cess could facilitate and automate this access but ther e are complexities and challenges Since providers patie nts and other interested parties such as researchers need v arious secure accesses data security policies have to con trol by group role and function Finally the security of the data once it leaves the cloud also needs to be assured 3  Data Operational Management The operational management capabilities 8,9,11  include data interoperability management at a globa l scale information timeliness to meet service level agreem ent, and operational support architecture to constantly auto matic and improve the quality of services Big data solution architectures have to be flexible  enough to cope with not only the additional sources but also the evolution of schemas and structures used for transporting and storing data To ensure analytics are meaningful accurate and suitable metadata and sem antic layers are needed that accurately define the data a nd provide business context and guidance including appropriat e and inappropriate uses of the data This evolution of s tandards will eventually improve interoperability and data q uality Data timeliness is a challenge in various healthcar e settings such as clinical decision support whethe r for making decisions or providing information that guid es decisions Big data can make decision support simpl er faster and ultimately more accurate because decisio ns are based on higher volumes of data that are more curre nt and relevant  As the data points and decision points a re going beyond the humanly availability during a very limit ed window for clinical decision support response time  has to be capped to run a report or analytic query. Carefu l attention to data and query structure, scope and execution is needed to ensure that the constraints of the processing windo ws are observed while still obtaining the best possible an swer In the Big Data ecosystems streams of e-Health dat a containing complex and varied events without an overarching structure need to be addressed In this  case those events have to be turned into meaningful meas ures in real time that are in turn suitable for rapid ana lysis Security of data is inherently built-in when e-Heal th regulations were designed for promoting e-Health ro ll outs As the operational infrastructure becomes extremely  complex operational management has become an integ ral part of the BDeHS when we design the solutions III  S OLUTIONS OF B IG D ATA S ERVICE FOR E H EALTH  Our Big Data for e-Health Service solutions are evo lved from our research of interoperable \(data\ flows as defined in 3,8,9  i n t o  s t r e a m s  a s  i l l u s t r a t e d  i n  t h e  F i g u r e  4 below  Figure 4.

5  A  Big Data Flows in e-Health Streams Our new solution provides data streaming federation  and decision points in supplement to the original f lows of eHealth adaptation and message routing [3,8,9   The center of the concept is around application flo w set-up procedures that detail the processing stages including data fork points, stream joints, as well as event a nd message logging  All of which are specified in a policy fo rmat that controls the in-flight processing of data A protoc ol command \(e.g., transform/send/store data\ may be tr iggered by a protocol type and the policy ID established du ring the flow setup processing A data flow in this e-Health environment is mapped into a stream with additional processing stages  F irst data formats are adapted via adaptation gateways into a common format as required by the e-Health metadata model while security policies are tagged along with the flows Data Federation is extended into our own e-Health adaptation gateways [3,11   w h i c h  a d m i t  d a t a  f l o w s  into the processing nodes with e-Health data processing logi cs filtering logging aggregation exploratory and i terative analysis regulatory checkpoints and so on  Insi de the BDeHS infrastructure processing nodes can further feed into another adaptation gateway for further flow an alysis so that information may be further correlated with oth er flows Data sinking gateways provide the exit points of th e eHealth data flows when anomalies e.g adverse tre atment or drug effects\ are detected on flight or when e-H ealth data security events have to be reported.  Data logs fro m relevant flows can be directed into certain exit gateways so  that aggregation can formulate dynamic solutions that re quire immediate decisions e.g responses to the spread patterns of an epidemic\.  In addition, aggregated data repo rts can be generated at any stages of the e-Health data stream s In between the data entries and exits a number of middle storage and processing stages supply data replications and parallel processing logics for add itional data segmentation summarization security and hea lth regulation policy enforcement filtering data transformation,  header and trailer expansion, mess age split or union, state synchronization, and coordination w ith other distributed processing nodes One key benefits of our solution approach is in e-H ealth Data Consistency Data adaptation and mappings prom ote consistency in self-reported data across the health care system to eliminate local discrepancies and increas e the usefulness of data  As e-Health becomes global sol utions we plan to come up with new ways to further the ada ptation layer to facilitate global scale usages Aggregatin g data regionally and globally also provides healthcare re searchers with larger populations for clinical studies trend ing and disease monitoring for epidemics, as well as early detection and the potential for improved results Another benefit is in its flexibility to deal with Regionalization and/or Globalization of flows. Exte rnal data will come from different medical systems in various regions and countries Effectively working across these dis parate data repositories can help identify local knowledge and best practices and leverage them regionally and globally  The BDeHS e-Health-flows deal with increasing mobil e Health application traffic as well  Demand for ubi quitous access to information mandates mobility and other technologies that provide access on demand As data  becomes more current, it can be forked out of the f lows into the mobility adaptation gateway into the hands of p eople with an immediate need for it such as for clinical  decision support. Quality of care and improved outcomes will be the ultimate benefits B  Security and Regulatory Compliance Secure BDeHS service payloads and information flows  have to be part of an e-Health solution.  Possible messages with security concerns include summary of patient r ecord exchange terminology mediation message handling includes transformation, routing, logging and cont ent based filtering secure data delivery and confirmation of meaningful usages Security framework in e-Health was already establis hed in [8    O n c e  a  s e c u r e  e H e a l t h c a r e  a s s o c i a t i o n  i s  established both end points may invite others to participate in a MPMD Multiple Participations and Multiple Drop-offs eHealthcare flow  The e-Healthcare Service Associat es Identifier\(s\ are correlated together so that each entity has the visibility to the relevant portion\(s of the commun ication payload while linking the total messages intended for different recipients  When the data streams are ro uted into any Big Data analytic engines patient-indefinable information are removed according to BDeHS security  policies following the intent and security level of  the steam sink points The major benefit of ID-removal ensures access to s ome de-identified data can simultaneously improve level s of selfreporting as well as data sharing  For example Pa tient ID credentials instead of the detail ID Name Addre ss information\ are no longer presented from clinical offices to the lab facilities  Sending only the essential mi nimum credential data that are pre-agreed upon among the  eHealthcare processing parties also enhances perform ance of rapid forking of the streams into Big Data processi ng clusters When we allow security associations with multiple entities, an issue has to be addressed as different parties may want to view a different subset of the records on-t he-fly in order to collaborate in the care process.   For exa mple, some portions of the patient records may not be relevant to another e-Healthcare party e.g such as the lab with a pr ocessing entity that only needs a patient identity without t he details of patient records 
986 


6  The issue of sending only a portion of relevant dat a set can now be achieved As multiple parties in secure eHealthcare association\(s and with their different roles and different access privileges being supported the en d-to-end streams set-up in BDeHS manages the potential growt h of many combinations among these join/sink points The  solution allows both individuals and the parties wi th which they are doing business to have higher-assurance tr ansactions without needing to exchange the details of informat ion as the security policy managers will take over those dispa rate works When the BDeHS processing nodes recognized the communication message contains HIPPA conformance required fields additional logging actions are inv oked before a node can process or send the payload forwa rd.  As such, regulatory compliance specific actions are ca rried out during the flow   An example of e-Health network p olicy action is to do packet inspection inside a data str eam to check the principal parties and the so called busin es associates as defined in HIPPA and HIGHTEC Acts and then to be conformant with HIPAA security rule of e nsuring the appropriete log entries will have a whole messa ge instead of a partial MDMP stream C  Data Operational Management and Data Timeliness Because not all e-Health Big Data flows are batch process we need to develop realtime flows that mee ts QoS such as time constraints and throughput requiremen ts in order to provide on-flight e-Health event detection  and aggregation analysis The current BDeHS capabilities include policy actio ns further combined with QoS actions as future traffic patterns are identified with routing of e-Health contents be ing further improved.   In other words, any routing policies ma y further reference application-oriended policies that have t o be satisfied before the routing can be applied 1  Centralized QoS Monitoring Monitoring the BDeHS performance is the essential step in provisioning additional storage clusters an d networking resources to guarantee QoS of e-Health B ig Data applications  QoS Service Managers are devise d to control and coordination of the end-to-end overall Big Data stream service views The QoS manager handles end-p oint performance parameter requests. During a BDeHS flow the QoS manager also monitors and assists in enforcemen t of end-to-end transmission performance via accessing to logs and reports of functional performance feedback 2  BDeHS Service Profile Management The best way to manage a wide variety of e-Health application flows is to maintain a number of BDeHS service profiles that can easily be converted into the requ ired action policies to provision and setup the big data stream s Service profiles describe how to provision services for a specific domain or functionality such as e-Health participation levels priorities acceptable usage parameters end-to-end test setup, and so on.  The services des cribe the specific interfaces to be used among interconnectio n participants to locate and exchange health informat ion.  All are governed by QoS parameters which in turn suppor t service level guarantees 3  Data Interoperability Management Our solution architecture is flexible enough to cop e with not only the additional sources but also the e volution of schemas and structures used for transporting and st oring data To ensure analytics are meaningful accurate and suitable metadata and semantic layers are supporte d that accurately define the data and provide business con text and guidance including appropriate and inappropriate u ses of the data This evolution of standards will eventual ly improve data quality IV  S UMMARY  We have presented a new BDeHS Big Data for Health Service approach to bring healthcare flows and data/message management intelligence into the ecosy stems for better stream processing operational managemen t and regulatory compliance  By asserting security contr ol into the service layer with native e-Health features our solutions ensure regulatory compliance Additional key benefits of our BDeHS operational features include   Big Data Stream setup and provision to support application flow associations data federation and aggregation along the streaming paths, partitioning of eHealth messages along the processing   Security to meet stringent e-Health environments an d regulations is an integral part of the infrastructu re Multiple flows can be managed by a common MPMD model.  End-to-end regulatory oversights can be guaranteed   Quality of Service guarantees includes realtime processing reconfiguration and enhancement of processing cluster and network capacity data interoperability management as well as reporting capabilities The BDeHS service solution as reported in this pape r has supplied the much needed detailed guidelines fo r overall Big Data services to achieve the meaningful usages of eHealth global solutions R EFERENCES  1  W Liu and E.K Park e-Health AON Application Or iented Network IEEE International Conference on Compute r Communication Networks, BMAN Workshop, Nausa, Baham as, July 2013 2  E.K.

performing online 3 A third survey was conducted, replicating the questions asked of parents in the first survey.  In this survey, parents were first informed about what students actually did online The survey was performed in the United States and Japan.  Results are summarized in the next section Table 11 shows that Japanese parents are significantly less aware of the activities that are done by online information service providers than their US counterparts are.  Approxima tely one third are aware that searches are tracked, and approximately one fourth are aware that ema il can be linked to other online activities.  More than 75% of US parents are aware that searches are tracked, and 40% or more are aware that some form of integration is performed across different online services  Table 12 shows that both US and Japanese parents would strongly prefer that their childrenês online activities be free from data mining.  However, Japanese parents are significantly more tolerant of the possibility that studentsê email may be data mined even if the email is provided by the studentsê school district.  This may in part be explained by their belief that their students are less likely to engage in inappropriate behavior online Our data \(not reported here due to length limitations cerned about data mining th eir studentsê online behavior.  A significant fraction of students have engaged in inappropriate behavior online or are aware of students who have.  As we have discussed in section 4 above nothing learned about online behavior is truly anonymous. Japanese parents do appear to have less reason for concern, given the apparently better behavior of Japanese students online.  However, self-reported data on sensitive subject areas are always imperfect, and differences in cultural norms may partly explain differences in the data on self-reported student activities  Additionally, studentsê have their own attitudes towards being profiled and to having their online activities tracked and integrated, and may consider this an invasion of privacy.  St udentsê strongly disapprove of tracking and integrating their online behavior, as summarized in tables 13 and 14

What data are consumers willing to trade in exchange for convenience and services online? Would they be as willing to engage in this trade if their privacy rights were more protected and if they had the ability to exercise meaningful control over their data 
    
Consumersê preferences would suggest that the default privacy settings should be no tracking without explicit permission and no in tegration without explicit permission.  Government s should hold firms accountable for violations and should ensure that violations are visible when they occur.  Governments should ensure that consumers can know exactly what companies have done, so that they can protect themselves, register displeasure, and change vendors if they deem it necessary to stop violations of their privacy.  Our data also show that the public is not widely aware of criminal violations of privacy, such as the WiSpy scandal in the US or iPhone hacking in the US, or Google Analytics violation of EU privacy laws Given that these violations are strongly counter to consumersê preferences perhaps they should receive greater attention and be more severely punished when they occur Many have argued that consumersê use of systems that compromise their priv acy do so fully informed and accepting the reduction in personal privacy as a free trade and a fair exchange for services rendered Clearly, we do not believe this to be the case, and clearly we do not believe that consumers are fully informed or have offered informed consent.  As Jay  We believe that any policy regulations enacted should have the following characteristics Regulations should treat companies equally regardless of their industry classification.  Telecommunications companies, regulated common carriers, and information services providers should have comparable obligations Regulations should be consistent.  If letters are protected, then emails and texts should be protected as well.  If information stored in remote electronic data storage facilities is protected, then information stored in remote electronic cloud data storage facilities should be protected as well Companiesê policies should be transparent.  Users should know what they are giving up, in exchange for çfree services.é  Users should understand the loss of anonymity associated with data mining and targeted ads.  Users should understand how the information gathered can be used, both for them and against them The fact that a service is free is not sufficient justification for obscuring the risks associated with that service.  No tobacco company could successfully argue that it was not subject to regulation because it provided its tobacco products free of charge to public school students.  Similarly providing information services free of charge does not eliminate the need to provide products that are safe and that observe all relevant regulations We are still conducting focus groups and experiments in additional locations.  Data analysis is also ongoing

Figure 6 Memory hierarchy behaviors among different workloads DataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average L2 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 21 while that for HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 4.8 5.1 14 and 16 respectively Among BigDataBench  most of the online service workloads have the higher L2 cache MPKI on the average 40 except Nutch server 4.1 while most of the of\003ine and realtime analytics workloads have the lower L2 cache MPKI on the average 13 except BFS 56 Third the average L3 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 1.5 while the average number of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 2.4 2.3 1.4 and 1.9 respectively This observation shows that the LLC L3 caches of the processors Xeon E5645 on our testbed are ef\002cient for the big data workloads corroborating the observation in DCBench  The ef\002ciency of L3 caches also can explain why the 003oating point intensity of BigDataBench on the Xeon E5645 is higher than on the Xeon E5310 only two levels of caches The TLB behaviors are shown in Figure 6-2 First the average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 0.54 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 0.006 0.005 0.06 and 0.08 respectively The more ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench may be caused by the complex third party libraries and deep software stacks of the big data workloads Second the average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is also higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 2.5 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 1.2 0.7 2 and 2.1 respectively And we can also 002nd that the numbers of DTLB MPKI of the big data workloads range from 0.2  Nutch server  to 14  BFS  The diversity of DTLB behaviors re\003ects the data access patterns are diverse in big data workloads which proves that diverse workloads should be included in big data benchmarks  Lessons Learned  On a typical state-of-practice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that L3 caches of the processor are ef\002cient for the big data workloads which indicates multi-core CPU design should pay more attention to area and energy ef\002ciency of caches for the big data applications The high number of L1I cache MPKI implies that better L1I cache performance is demanded for the big data workloads We conjecture that the deep software stacks of the big data workloads are the root causes of high frond-end stalls We are planning further investigation into this phenomenon by changing the software stacks under test e.g replacing MapReduce with MPI 7 Conclusion In this paper we presented our joint research efforts with several industrial partners on big data benchmarking Our methodology is from real systems covering not only broad application scenarios but also diverse and representative real-world data sets We proposed an innovative data generation methodology and tool to generate scalable volumes of big data keeping the 4 V properties Last we chose and developed nineteen big data benchmarks from dimensions of application scenarios operations algorithms data types data sources software stacks and application types Also we reported the workloads characterization results of big data as follows 002rst in comparison with the traditional benchmarks the big data workloads have very low 


operation intensity Second the volume of data input has non-negligible impact on micro-architecture characteristics of big data workloads so architecture research using only simple applications and small data sets is not suf\002cient for big data scenarios Last but not least on a typical state-ofpractice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that for the big data workloads the LLC of the processor is effective and better L1I cache performance is demanded as the big data workloads suffer high L1I cache MPKI 8 Acknowledgements We are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd Dr

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
