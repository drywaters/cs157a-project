Abstract 
Ecology is nowadays an interdisciplinary collaborative and data-intensive science therefore discovering integrating and analysing daily-produced data is necessary to support researchers to investigate complex questions ranging from single particles to animals to the biosphere As a consequence 
ecology-related multimedia content has been produced massively in recent years for example the Xeno-canto project 
1 2 
and the Pl@ntNet project respectively collected 140,000 audio records of 8,700 bird species and about 60,000 thousand images covering thousand of plant species to be used by scientists or professionals Unfortunately a manual analysis of such amount of generated data is impossible automatic analysis tools combined with highperformance computing HPC solutions are therefore heavily demanded for making sense of such big ecological data In this paper we present a case study of large-scale video processing on HPC facilities for underwater sh monitoring in the context of the 
Fish4Knowledge project

I I NTRODUCTION With the recent progress in digital cameras storage capabilities and high-speed computer networks ecology-related multimedia content is nowadays routinely and massively generated This enabled long-term and reliable environmental monitoring through remote-sensing platforms as in the 
 where a system to analyse long-term underwater camera footage has been developed The paper is meant to report on the employed hardware/software architecture the design and deployment of the parallel job manager and the problems encountered during the whole process from load balancing to job submission policies to bottlenecks 
case of the underwater domain where cameras have been effectively employed to study marine wildlife In particular  recent projects in the underwater domain have generated visual data at an astonishing rate for instance in the 
 10 underwater cameras have been recording videos for 12 hours a day in the last four years resulting in about 200 TB of raw video data If on one hand the recent technology progress has facilitated the data collection process on the other hand it is impractical and even impossible for human operators to manually analyse this bulk of data For this reason tools for automated video analysis able to achieve high performance in terms of accuracy are needed and resorting to high

performance computing HPC solutions becomes inescapable since processing data on such a large scale is unfeasible on 1 http://www.xeno-canto.org 2 http://www.plantnet-project.org 3 http://www.ìsh4knowledge.eu single machines Recently various approaches have exploited HPC in ecology most dealing primarily with either supporting observatory networks for data storage and sharing 5 or computational models for environmental forecasting However to the best of our knowledge no existing system has tackled the problem of on-demand or real-time ecological data processing To this end this paper aims at reporting the case study of large-scale underwater video processing for the system 
developed within the 
 which aims at supporting marine biologists in their research on coral reefs targeted at studying sh population and biodiversity  tasks which so far have been performed by employing divers to manually count the sh in a speciìc area  and infer sh population s uctuations The automatic processing system relies on computationally-intensive video analysis tools for producing meaningful information e.g sh species counts running on a thousand-node computing cluster provided by the Taiwanês National Center for Highperformance Computing with Load Sharing Facility LSF as a job submission/queue manager This system differs from

to run on cores belonging to different physical hosts without the need of writing code for host communication Each host is equipped with a 48-core 2.3 GHz CPU and 128 GB RAM The rst design decision concerned the parallelization strategy either on the video processing algorithms i.e parallelizing the internal mechanics of the code or on the video data i.e launching as many serial s as possible Two main reasons led us to parallelize at the data level only rst of all the algorithms have been designed and written to run single-threadedly thus a complete rewrite would be impractical for our objectives Moreover the level of parallelization is limited since due the high number of core requests the cluster infrastructure rarely assigns more than 20 cores to a single job whereas typical parallel architectures for image processing provide thousands of cores able to perform simple operations such as GPUs rather than few powerful cores The second reason concerned the fact that the cluster management system does not guarantee that all cores assigned to a job would belong to the same physical machine Since core communication in a parallel video processing algorithm needs to be performed dozens of time per second networking might have become a bottleneck As a side note since we mentioned GPUs it is worth explaining the reason why we did not use them The GPU implementation of our fastest sh detection algorithm ViBe  on a 2496-core machine pro vided a 70-times speed-up with respect to the execution on a serial architecture However since we could run 600 simultaneous processes on the cluster we would have needed at least 9 such GPU cards to achieve the same performance Furthermore the speed-up was veriìed on the motion detection algorithm only which represents the smallest fraction of the computation since the sh tracking and recognition modules are considerably slower and less apt to parallelization Once decided to keep running serial s while maximising the number of simultaneous running process issues on how the cluster would handle that many requests and the extent of the queue management and wait overhead were considered  The interface for the submission of jobs to the cluster consists in a set of command-line applications provided by the LSF job queueing system A job could be submitted to several different  each queue deìnes its own job submission policy  most importantly the and number of cores per job For example there are queues which allow to assign a single core to each job most appropriate for our serial approach while others require each job to be assigned to more than one cores and this may lead to an efìciency problem since s are not able to exploit core parallelism In order to handle this issue we revised the original workîow as follows when the creates a new  the latter is also given information on the number of cores available for it and launches simultaneous s In this way it is ensured that no cores are left unused even with queues requiring multiple cores per job  As mentioned above each queue also has a limit on the maximum number of cores that can be used at a given moment when that limit is reached additional jobs are marked as until other jobs complete and cores are freed However fair use policy requires not to queue too many jobs when the core limit is reached since this prevents other users who might just want to run a one-time job from gaining access to the cluster in reasonable time since they would have to wait for all previously queued jobs to be started and nish Therefore the was modiìed so it would be aware of the total number of available cores understand when that limit is reached and if necessary stop creating new s for a while  Administration policy imposes a delay of a few minutes from 3 to 5 between two consecutive job starts in a given queue According to Table I 3-5 minutes is a considerable amount of time with respect to a total VPE execution time especially for the low resolution videos This limitation may cause only very few processes to run at the same time in spite of the large number of cores available The solution to this problem was to lengthen the lifetime of s Since the execution time of s is practically xed it only depends on the resolution of the input video the only way is to pack several consecutive runs inside a single  In practice each is parameterised by a value  which instructs it to launch s in sequence to keep the job running for enough time This idea together with the solution for the rst issue see above led to the following internal workîow Rather than running a single at a time executing a set of simultaneous s herein referred as  on a dedicated core each For times launching sequentially a i.e wait for the completion of the previous block to start the next one This guarantees that 1 all assigned cores are used and 2 the minimum running time for the whole is at least equal to the duration of a consecutive single s In the actual implementation in order to handle the case when in a block some s complete before others thus leaving cores unused the does not manage sequential VPE blocks internally but It periodically checks for the number of used cores up to  if there are free cores it launches a new  and keeps track of the number of s executed up to that point When the number of launched s reaches  it quits This second solution maximises core utilisation while keeping the job lifetime of approximately the same length as in the case of sequential VPE blocks 
Serial and multi-core jobs Maximum number of cores per queue Delay between consecutive jobs

The execution of a on a video provides as output the sh detections and trajectories in the processed video This information is currently stored in a MySQL database version 5.5.28 for further analysis The server machine is equipped with a Dual Intel X5650 2.67 GHz CPU 144 GB RAM and 2 TB FC connecting to a SAN storage The main tables involved in the video processing are those containing sh detection and tracking results table called  and the lists of all existing videos   and already processed videos   In detail the database interactions for each video processing are 1 selection of the video to be processed by the querying the and tables and 2 saving of processingês results to the database writing the table The issues arisen when dealing with the database can be summarised as follows  After the completes processing a video the results are to be written to the database Because of the high number of parallel processes the time needed to insert a single sh detection to the database may take a few seconds which multiplied by the number of processes up to 600 and the number of sh instances per video in the order of hundreds or thousands depending on the video unavoidably would cause the database server to become unresponsive In order to minimise the number of database queries for results insertion we modiìed the ORM Object-relational mapping software employed to interface the to the database so that it caches insertion queries rather than executing them immediately and runs a single big query inserting all cached rows at once In this way we are able to drastically reduce the number of queries performed by a factor of 100 i.e the maximum number of cached queries The only risk is that a failure e.g due to timeout in the query may cause the loss of several sh detections instead of just one However the testing phase of this approach showed that very rarely and only for very short times queries queued in the database server We did not use solutions based on federated tables because they show several limitations the performance when doing bulk inserts is slower than with other table types and federated tables do not support indexes and this is necessary for querying large tables  When the starts a  it has to provide the latter with the video to be processed By video we mean both the video identiìer ID and the video le path The video ID is retrieved by querying the and tables to nd the rst chronologically video not processed yet After the video ID is retrieved it is passed to the which updates the table to prevent other s from processing the same video However since the video ID retrieval and the update are not performed atomically i.e the video ID is selected other processes could read the database the VPE updated  the probability that multiple processes would select the same video ID is high given the number of parallel jobs To handle this problem we introduced a new auxiliary table called so that when the looks up the next video to be processed it also checks if that video is in the table if it is then the skips it and looks for the next one otherwise it conìrms the video ID selection and puts it into  This guarantees that a video ID is selected only by a single  However what if the VPE processing that video fails for some reasons and does not manage to process it In this case no other s would process that video again since it is in the table To avoid this we added a timestamp eld into the table so that the reservation only holds for a while In other words a reserved video could be selected again if a few days have passed since its reservation and it has not been marked as completed in   Given the size of the table about 550.000 records and the increasing size of the and tables after a while the query for the selection of the videos to be processed may start taking too long this causes the same problem occurred for the insertion of sh detections i.e database queries would queue faster than they are being processed For this reason we modiìed the behaviour of the for what concerned the video selection rather than querying the database to get a single video ID for a newly started  it now selects the video IDs in advance for s it would be starting during its lifetime i.e as deìned above Assuming value used in our case this reduces the number of queries by about two orders of magnitude The nal workîow of the system applying the modiìcations described above to the simple model in Fig 1 resulted in the schema depicted in Fig 2 The main difference from the previous scheme is that also s internally manage multiple background to keep all cores busy and the retrieval of video IDs is performed only once at the beginning rather than for one at a time IV R ESULTS The processing of the historical video dataset on the supercomputer described in the previous section took 70 days the estimated time on a single core was about 12 years using 600 cores 24 hours a day The design strategies described previously were necessary because the rst version of the workîow see Fig 1 would unavoidably end up overloading the system At the video processing completion the table had about sh detections and the whole database size consisted of about 300 GB Therefore the automatic video

Fig 2 Final workîow for the master and slave processes and VPE subprocesses analysis executed on the supercomputer allowed us to turn about 200 TB of raw video data into 300 GB of useful information ready to be explored by marine biologists V C ONCLUSION In this paper we introduced the problem of large-scale underwater video processing and analysed the technical difìculties and challenges of dealing with a huge amount of videos in reasonable time The context of this work concerns the use of underwater cameras for automatically monitoring sh populations thanks to the use of sh detection tracking and recognition software running on the captured videos However the large number of video clips more than 500,000 10-minute videos since 2009 and the kind of processing to be performed which takes longer than the actual duration of the videos made it impossible in terms of time required for processing to run the video analysis software on common generalpurpose PCs For this reason we resorted to massive parallelcomputing infrastructures to execute the video analysis algorithms in order to reduce the processing times However simply increasing the number of available cores turned out to be just not enough to solve the large-scale processing task as many other problems arose from administrative usage policies of the cluster to database synchronisation and bottlenecks To tackle all these problems a suitable system workîow was designed and proved to work effectively on the given scenario It is important to point out that such workîow may be suitable to other applications e.g for human video surveillance with a processing pipeline video capture target identiìcation statistical analysis similar to the one here presented since the knowledge on the visual appearance of the targets may be encapsulated inside the target detection tracking and classiìcation algorithms The source code of the algorithms is freely available online 7  As future work on this topic we plan on investigating algorithm-level parallelisation instead or beside the data-level one and intelligent workîow designs which are able to select the computer vision algorithms used to process a video in accordance to user requirements on the accuracy of the results or the speed of computation In conclusion combining automatic analysis tools and HPC facilities allowed us to distill the initial massive raw video data about 200 TB and to present it to the end-users in a coherent and concise form thus providing a very powerful tool and a big dataset containing billions of detected sh the rst ecological dataset of that size for marine biologists to carry out exhaustive and never done before research on underwater life R EFERENCES  W  K Michener and M B Jones Ecoinformatics supporting ecology as a data-intensive science  vol 27 no 2 pp 85Ö93 Jan 2012  J R Jensen  2nd ed Prentice Hall May 2006  D Pelletier  K Leleu D Mallet G Mou Tham G Herv  e M Boureau and N Guilpart Remote high-deìnition rotating video enables fast spatial survey of marine underwater macrofauna and habitats  vol 7 p p e30536 2012  M K eller  D S Schimel W  W  Har gro v e and F  M Hof fman  A continental strategy for the National Ecological Observatory Network  vol 6 no 5 pp 282Ö284 Jun 2008  T  K Kratz P  Arzber ger  B J Benson C.-Y  Chiu K Chiu L Ding T Fountain D Hamilton P C Hanson Y H Hu F.-P Lin D F McMullen S Tilak and C Wu Toward a global lake ecological observatory network  University of Joensuu Finland Fall 2006  G G Moisen E A Freeman J A Blackard T  S Frescino N E Zimmermann and T C Edwards Jr Predicting tree species presence and basal area in utah A comparison of stochastic gradient boosting generalized additive models and tree-based methods  vol 199 pp 176Ö187 2006  C V  P attengill-Semmens and B X Semmens Conserv ation and management applications of the reef volunteer sh monitoring program  vol 81 no 1-3 pp 43Ö50 Jan-Feb 2003 n/a  C Spampinato Y  H Chen-Bur ger  G Nadarajan and R B Fisher  Detecting Tracking and Counting Fish in Low Quality Unconstrained Underwater Videos in  2008 pp 514Ö519  C Spampinato D Giordano R Di Salv o Y H J Chen-Bur ger  R B Fisher and G Nadarajan Automatic sh classiìcation for underwater species behavior understanding in  2010 pp 45Ö50  E Beauxis-Aussalet S P alazzo G Nadarajan E Arslano v a C Spampinato and L Hardman A video processing and data retrieval framework for sh population monitoring in  ser MAED 13 ACM 2013 pp 15Ö20  O Barnich and M V an Droogenbroeck V iBe a uni v ersal background subtraction algorithm for video sequences  vol 20 no 6 pp 1709Ö24 Jun 2011 7 http://sourceforge.net/projects/ìsh4knowledgesourcecode

the policy updating Proof We prove the correctness for each operation in our scheme as follows  LSSS Structure/Threshold Gate Updating  The secret s is re-randomized under the new access policy such that the correctness is guaranteed by the secret sharing scheme  Attr 2 OR  Suppose c j is the coefìcient chosen for x j during the decryption We can simply get the coefìcient c n  1  c j  a m for x n  1 when the new attribute x n  1 is chosen instead of x j during the decryption  Attr 2 AND  Suppose c j is the coefìcient chosen for x j during the decryption under the previous access policy To decrypt the ciphertext under the new access policy we still choose c j as the coefìcient for x j and set the coefìcient c n  1   c j a m for x n  1   AttrRmOR  This operation will not affect the coefìcient choices of the remaining attributes in the OR gate  AttrRmAND  The same as threshold gate updating B Completeness Proof Theorem 2 Our scheme is complete for updating any types of access policies Proof The proposed policy updating method is designed based on access policies with LSSS structures i.e it can convert any  M    LSSS structure to a new one  M       For any access tree policy which is constructed with several threshold gates and a set of attributes we have proposed an operation to update a threshold gate to any other threshold gate by converting the threshold gates into LSSS structure Thus our scheme can also update any access tree policy Considering the boolean formula is a special access tree only with AND and OR gates we propose a more efìcient method to update the policy with boolean formulas Any new boolean formulas can be derived from the previous boolean formulas by iteratively doing the operations Attr 2 AND  Attr 2 OR  AttrRmAND and AttrRmOR  Therefore our proposed operations are complete for updating any access policies C Security Proof Our access control scheme is constructed on prime order groups because the group operations on prime order groups are much faster than the ones on composite order groups In this section we will prove that our dynamic policy access control scheme is secure in the generic bilinear group model  12 13 and random oracle model 14 Ho we v e r  our scheme can also be easily extended to be provable secure in the random oracle model by using groups with composite orders Theorem 3 Our scheme is secure in the generic bilinear group model and random oracle model if no polynomial time adversary can get non-negligible advantage in the security game deìned in Section II-C Proof Our access control scheme is constructed based on the CP-ABE method with primer group order CP-ABEPrimer in which is pro v e d t o b e secure under generic bilinear group model and random oracle model At an intuitive level this means that if there are any vulnerabilities in the scheme then these vulnerabilities must exploit speciìc mathematical properties of elliptic curve groups or cryptographic hash functions used when instantiating the scheme Let A be an adversary who can break our scheme with non-negligible advantage and we will construct an A  such that it can break the CP-ABE-Primer scheme in with non-ne gligible advantage Different with the security game in in our security game the adversary returns a tuple of policies   M  1    1      M  q    q   together with two messages  m 0  m 1   and the adversary receives an encryption of M b under each of these policies Moreover our security game also allows the update key query for the challenging messages  m 0  m 1  between two access policies  M

involve with the challenge data if we consider the encryption random numbers are the same in encrypting m 0 and m 1 this is because only one challenge message is chosen by the simulator by tossing a

give the deìnition of access structures in ABE systems then we introduce two types of access structures that are well used in constructing ABE schemes LSSS Structure and Access Tree Structure Deìnition 3 Access Structure  Let  P 1  P 2    P n  be a set of parties A collection A 015 2  P 1  P 2    P n  is monotone if  B  Cif B  A and B 015 C then C  A  An access structure respectively monotone access structure is a collection respectively monotone collection A of non-empty subsets of  P 1  P 2    P n   i.e A 015 2  P 1  P 2    P n      The sets in A are called the authorized sets and the sets not in A are called the unauthorized sets In attribute-based encryption scheme the role of the parties is taken by the attributes Thus the access structure A will contain the authorized sets of attributes We restrict our attention to monotone access structures A LSSS Structure Deìnition 4 Linear Secret-Sharing Schemes LSSS  A secret-sharing scheme  over a set of parties P is called linear over Z p f 1 The shares for each party form a vector over Z p  2 There exists a matrix M called the share-generating matrix for   The matrix M has l rows and n columns  Algorithm 5 AccessTree Input T  A threshold tree Input s  The secret to be shared Output a set of shares  s 1    s l  1 Let q x be a polynomial for node x  2 Set q root  0    s  3 Set degree d root   k root  1  k root is the threshold value of the root 4 Let rest of points in q root be randomly chosen 5 for all x  T do 6 Set degree of q x as d x   k x  1 7 Set q x  0  q parent  x   index  x   8 Let rest of points in q x be chosen randomly 9 end for For all i  1    l the i-th row of M is labeled by a party   i    is a function from  1    l  to P  When we consider the column vector v  s  r 2    r n   where s  Z p is the secret to be shared and r 2    r n  Z p are randomly chosen then Mv is the vector of l shares of the secret s according to   The share  Mv  i belongs to party   i   Every linear secret sharing-scheme according to the above deìnition also enjoys the linear reconstruction property Suppose that  is a LSSS for the access structure A  Let S  A be any authorized set and let I  1  2    l  be deìned as I   i    i   S   Then there exist constants  w  Z p  i  I such that for any valid shares   i  of a secret s according to  we have  i  I w i  i  s  These constants  w i  can be found in time polynomial in the size of the share-generating matrix M We note that for unauthorized sets no such constants  w i  exist B Access Tree Structure An access tree is deìned as a tree T  where every noleaf node x represents a threshold gate  k x  num x   num x is the number of its children and every leaf x is described by an attribute att  x  and a threshold value k x  The function parent  x  denotes the parent of the node x in the tree T also deìnes an ordering number for each child node and the function index  x  returns such a number associated with the node x  Policy Checking  To determine whether or not an access tree T is satisìed by a set of attributes S  the policy checking algorithm recursively computes as follows If node x is a nonleaf node it returns 1 iff at least k x children return 1 otherwise returns 0 If x is a leaf node then it returns 1 iff att  x   S  otherwise returns 0 Tree Implementing  The secret s to be shared is rst assigned to the root node of the tree by using a random polynomial q root with q root  0  s  The rest of the nodes are used to distributed this root polynomial amongst the other nodes as smaller degree polynomials as illustrated in

is 1.39 kg and the mean associated with the treatment group using the thrusters-only ACS is 2.49 kg The computed Fvalue is 16.96 which corresponds to an experimental p-value of p  3  91 002 10 000 4  Since the experimental p-value is much less than the signi\002cance threshold one can say that the data shows a statistically signi\002cant difference between the two control modes in fuel consumption This extremely low p-value is indicative of a statistical fuel savings associated with using a blended control mode This result makes physical sense because CMGs use only electrical power for maneuvering Therefore when the CMGs are being used to control attitude no thrusters are being 002red which implies that no fuel is being consumed Rejecting the null hypothesis supports the idea that a blended control mode can provide the user with a comparable experience at an average fuel savings of 45 and a maximum of 84 shown in Table 3 Table 3 226 Fuel Consumption Data Control Mode  Subject Combined RCS Only j Fuel Saved j 050kg\051 050kg\051 050%\051  1 3.07 3.49 11.89 2 0.60 1.97 69.66 3 1.32 1.81 26.89 4 1.26 1.83 31.05 5 0.65 1.88 65.65 6 0.46 2.92 84.22 7 1.14 2.91 60.88 8 1.73 3.14 44.91 9 1.19 2.29 48.02 10 1.19 2.58 53.98 11 2.32 2.81 17.17 12 2.33 2.78 16.13 13 0.83 1.94 57.31 The electrical power required by the batteries would come from a rechargeable source and could be used on several missions Also by 002ne tuning the gains to a speci\002c astronaut's choosing the system can be highly adaptable as far as work platform stiffness response time desired overshoot The CMGs provide a continuous control mechanism compared to the discrete on-off times of the thrusters and can eliminate errors associated with attitude or pointing requirements whereas a thrusters-only ACS can only work within the limits of a particular deadband set by the control system As a result the combined control mode provides a much smoother response to attitude disturbances than the thrusters Figure 14 shows box plots with the 002rst second 050median\051 and third quartiles of the data as well as the minimum and maximum On the left are the results from the combined ACS while on the right are the results from the RCS only ACS Figure 14 demonstrates that the entire 002rst through third quartiles of the combined ACS are below the 002rst quartile of the RCS thrusters only ACS Figure 15 plots the fuel consumption data for both control modes for each of the subjects The fuel consumption data reveals many interesting things such as the variation between subjects on the amount of fuel needed for the same control mode 050i.e subject 1 and subject 3 use a different amount of fuel for the RCS only control mode\051 Also the data shows that there is always a reduction in fuel used when switching Figure 14 226 Fuel Consumption Box Plot Figure 15 226 Plot of Fuel Consumption vs Subject 050Both Control Modes\051 between the RCS only control mode and the combined control mode 050the difference between the vertical lines\051 5 C ONCLUSION The use of real-time visualization software for simulation validation and testing is an extremely bene\002cial tool The graphics can provide insight into the behavior of the system During the initial setup actual thruster plume models were used to show which thrusters were being commanded by the ACS The observed behavior of the jets facilitated the veri\002cation of the DCM transformation between the Jetpack's body and asteroid's ACI coordinates Also the incorporation of graphics gave a more robust complete feeling to the simulation environment Pairing the graphics component with the VR Lab hardware 050helmet gloves 6-DoF electromagnetic tracking etc.\051 produced an immersive environment for algorithm testing since the subject could actually sit down and feel as if he/she were piloting the actual Jetpack system Current work already under progress and future work include modifying the simulation for various CMG architectures modeling CMG power consumption and selecting an optimal CMG size based on parametrically varying CMG parameters 050i.e 003ywheel speed 003ywheel inertia and gimbal rate\051 and a Monte Carlo sim framework Overall the combined ACS proved to be the preference of the 10 


human subjects Also from a design standpoint the combined control mode is also the preferred choice CMGs use electrical power which in turn reduces overall fuel consumption and extends mission life with the same given amount of propellant CMGs also are a continuous control actuator and therefore achieve a much 002ner pointing resolution than the thruster's discrete control actuator model By varying the control system gains one can create a much stiffer work platform and/or a faster response time depending upon the particular preference of the user Including four CMGs in a pyramid con\002guration provides a level of redundancy while also simplifying the steering law A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank NASA Johnson Space Center and in particular the VR Lab for their gracious support and help during this effort The members of the VR Lab helped with overall EDGE design and interface requirements They also helped with initial setup hardware integration and testing of the pre-existing hardware This work was supported by the Draper Laboratory Internal Research and Development 050IR&D\051 program We are very grateful for the support and acknowledgment from our Draper colleagues R EFERENCES   B Chapman A Crenshaw A Guertin and C Gwennap 0502013\051 A v ailable http://poe.olin.edu/poe2013/s  engr2210groundbots/Mechanical  Subsystem.html   N S Bedrossian J Paradiso E V Bergmann and D Rowell 223Redundant single gimbal control moment gyroscope singularity analysis,\224 Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics  vol 13 pp 1096\2261101 1990   M Jackson and R D McDonald 223Draper simulation analysis tool 050dsat\051 Graphical object simulation techniques and tools for simulink,\224 in AIAA Modeling and Simulation Technologies Conference and Exhibit  Providence Rhode Island Aug 2004   M.Carpenter B Cohanim K Duda J Rize C Dopart J Hoffman K Jackson and et al 223Next-generation maneuvering system with control-moment gyroscopes for extravehicular activities near low-gravity objects,\224 in AIAA International Conference on Environmental Systems  Vail Colorado Jul 2013   Metecs 0502010\051 Onli A v ailable http://www.metecs.com/products-edge.php   J Harrington 0502013\051 Available http://www.ascensiontech.com/realtime/rt\003ockofbirds.php   C Ericson Real-Time Collision Detection  New York NY Focal Press 2005   R Winkler and W Hays Statistics Probability Inference and Decision 0502nd edition\051  New York NY Holt Rinehart and Winston 1975 B IOGRAPHY  Jared Rize received his B.S in Mechanical Engineering 050Aerospace concentration\051 in 2012 from Lehigh University He is currently an M.S student in Aeronautical/Astronautical Engineering at MIT He is currently a Draper Laboratory Fellow at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Cambridge MA His current research activities include design and development of control laws for spacecraft or space vehicles with blended attitude control actuators Michele Carpenter is a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory She received a B.S in Astrophysics from UCLA in 2002 and a Ph.D in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Cornell University in 2009 Her Ph.D research focused on the dynamics and control of gyroscopically actuated space robotic systems At Draper she specializes in Guidance Navigation and Control algorithm development and analysis for strategic and space programs Prior to her graduate work she spent two years working in the Ballistic Missile Defense division at MIT Lincoln Laboratory Bobby Cohanim is the Mission Design Group Leader and a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory He joined Draper Laboratory in September 2006 He has led several space and autonomy R&D efforts while at Draper Before coming to Draper Bobby also worked at JPL He received his B.S from Iowa State University in Aerospace Engineering 0502002\051 his S.M in Aero/Astro from MIT 0502004\051 and ScD in Aero/Astro from MIT 0502013\051 Jeffrey Hoffman is Professor of the Practice of Aerospace Engineering in the Aero/Astro Department at MIT He received a B.A in Astronomy from Amherst College 0501966\051 a Ph.D in Astrophysics from Harvard 11

  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
