The innovation is in the risk mitigation.  Instead of defaulting to accepting zero risk, LADEE\222s budget and schedule forced its personnel to consider what is truly necessary to guarantee mission success.  The resulti ng approach is not perfect, but good enough to retire the photovoltaic subsystem technical risk at a massive cost savings.  It is the re evaluation of conventional, risk averse and high cost methods that forms the heart of this work  Addressing the Risk  From the power system team\222s perspective, the risk to requirement #EPS 4 was secondary to the lack of a proper end to end power generation subsystem test.  The solar panel manufacturer already performed LAPSS testing on individual panels; the compiled res ults of which exceed the EPS 4 requirement. [6 T he s p i r i t o f t he r i s k w a s t ha t e ve n though each component of the subsystem passed its respective testing, the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Specifically, the EPS team cited the fol lowing possible causes of system level failure   Incorrect or swapped solar panel connectors.  Will manifest as mis mapping panels to solar array switches   Damage or degradation to the COTS PCB carrying the solar array switches   Proper harness connectio ns, but corrosion or degradation leading to an increased harness resistance Would only manifest at higher currents and lead to a power loss or shift in the panel\222s current \221knee.\222   An individual string within a panel is degraded damaged, or failed follow ing delivery and installation   A software bug in the code driving the solar array switches.  Will manifest as closing a switch to the wrong solar array segment   Improper connections or software for measuring the PRT temperature sensors embedded in selected solar panels   Improper connections or software for measuring the Coarse Sun Sensors embedded in selected solar panels  The standard LAPSS test method, appropriate to Class C and higher missions, would expose any and all of the above failure modes NASA ARC does not have an on site facility, and the funding \(~$100k\ and months to construct and calibrate were simply not available.  Even if it were available, a singular LAPSS test has limitations of its own Subsequent panel damage due to handling may  not be revealed until post launch.  The two months to ship the 


   6 spacecraft and perform the test are costly and risk prone The EPS team therefore needed a low cost, quick turn approach.  A review of the detailed risks reveals none is particularly sophisti cated or necessitating high technology Most are related to functionality only, and the performance requirements do not imply that efficiency characterization is even necessary.  Therefore, a LAPSS facility would be overkill.  The team simplified the proc ess by making a key decision   Formally verify requirement #EPS 4 using the manufacturer\222s per panel LAPSS test data   The test results are consistent across each panel type and will also be used for system modeling and initial mission operations allocati ons  The general process for an end to end test can now be boiled down to the following basic flow: [7  1  Set up a lamp aligned with the center of a single panel at a safe distance from the panel  2  Configure the avionics\222 software to open all solar array switches, save the switch and segment associated with the panel under test  3  Warm up the lamp \(covered\ for one minute \(nominal  4  Quickly remove the cover, and record the spacecraft solar array current  5  Continue to illuminate the spacecraft, monitoring cur rent and temperature until the system stabilizes Abort if safety limits are violated  6  Power off the lamp  7  Move the lamp to the next panel and repeat the process Maintain the same lamp configuration and distance for consistency  Selecting and Tuning the Lamp  Picking the lamp system was largely driven by the type of bulb required; it and subsequent tuning required the most engineering effort in the activity.  Initially, the LADEE team used a small, handheld halogen lamp.  Unfortunately, the panels only  generated about 30mA using this light, or 3% of their rating.  The initial impulse was to simply find a higher wattage lamp.  On further investigation, the spectrum generated by halogen is not the best solution for testing solar panels.  Sunlight, especia lly without atmospheric attenuation or distortion, can be approximated by Planck\222s blackbody equation  A ny  m a n made bulb will differ from the ideal sunlight spectrum to some degree; however, a halogen bulb will tend to generate less UV and more infrar ed than sunlight.  This translates into less energy transformed to current, and more energy manifested as heat Therefore, a very high power halogen lamp is required to generate current close to a panel\222s rating, at the risk of overheating the panels.  Th at said, halogen is attractive as a solution in that many inexpensive and portable COTS options are available.  Further research into theatre lighting revealed metal halide lamp systems as another option Specifically, metal halide bulbs are typically use d in high power theatre lamps sold as \221sunlight\222 lamps.  These lamps are designed to simulate sunlight for indoor filming or photography  Fortunately, lamps of this type are easily rented by theatre supply houses.  The EPS team rented a couple lamps at a  relatively inexpensive rate \(~$750 per week\ and ran experiments on a flight qualification panel \(Figure 7 Relatively few NASA engineers are theatre lighting operators; the qualification \(qual\ panel was ideal for this experiment.  The qual panel is a factory tested unit from the same lot as the flight panels; any results translate easily to the spacecraft test.  Being a non flight spare panel, testing can occur outside of a cleanroom environment, with plenty of space and no major concerns regarding dam age or degradation.  The team built a panel test fixture and mounted the whole assembly to an optical bench Connections were provided measuring current and embedded sensor temperature \(Figure 7\.  Testing involved iterative adjustment of the lamp distanc e, focus, and on time to find a combination of single panel spot size and sufficient current, at a safe temperature.  Table 3 shows the parameters the team chose for a safe system test: [7  Table 3:  Lamp Configuration Parameters  Parameter  Value for Flight  Test  Height  Varies based on spacecraft orientation Align with panel center  Distance to Panel  No closer than 36 inches  Lamp Focus  Roughly 15% spot for 25% de rated current with a spot size of one panel  Illumination Time  1 minute warm up with scrim  cover installed, followed by up to 3 minutes with scrim removed    Figure 7:  Experimenting with the Qualification Panel  


   7 The team settled on an 1800W Hydrargyrum  Medium arc Iodide \(HMI; i.e. metal halide\ lamp system, with ballast and adjustable stand.  Figure 8 shows the scaled lamp spectrum over laid onto a 6000K blackbody spectrum 8  9  T he t o t a l p ur c ha s e p r i c e f o r t he  s ys t e m i s  1 1 k w i t h a  three week lead t ime  Selecting the Current  The amount of current required for a \221passing\222 test was the matter of some debate.  Ideally, the maximum panel current would be generated so as to meet the EPS 4 requirement by test.  However, the theatre lamp is not that prec ise; slight variations in warm up time, distance, and focus can produce large swings in panel current.  The lab experiments also showed that some cases can generate currents in excess of the design value.  To eliminate risk of hardware damage, the flight t est requires a minimum of 500mA generation, and a target of 80% of the manufacturer\222s LAPSS measurement 7  T hi s va l ue i s l a r ge e no ug h t o e xp o s e a n y  s ub s t a nt i a l  power losses in signal path, and to cause a failed string to clearly result in an out of fami ly measurement  Hardware and Personnel Safety  Thermal 227 In addition to safely de rating the current generation, several safety aspects required resolution prior to the first flight test.  Though the metal halide bulbs better approximate the sunlight spectrum, they still generate infrared.  Both the panel and surrounding flight hardware require real time monitoring to prevent thermal related damage.  Only 40% of th e LADEE panels carry embedded temperature sensors.  To maintain hardware safety, the test requires use of a calibrated, handheld thermal imager.  The specific imager used \(Fluke Ti25\ is essentially an infrared digital camera.  The entire panel can be moni tored and saved for offline analysis.  The test limit for panel temperature is 70\272 Celsius, driven by the mounting bushings.  This proved good for nominal safety measurements, but limited for precision use due to surface reflections  Contamination 227 LADEE is a contamination sensitive mission due to the presence of mass spectrometers and optical instruments.  All spacecraft activities occur in 10k clean tent, and instruments are continuously bagged and purged.  Theatre lamp systems are not necessarily design ed for a clean room environment.  The rental lamps see heavy usage, and often have peeling paint.  New lamps outgas substantially, and must be burned in prior to test in the clean tent     Figure 8:  Test La mp Spectrum  


Optics 227 Though the lamp is, roughly speaking, meant to simulate sunlight spectrum and intensity, most of the optical hardware on the spacecraft is not designed to look directly into the sun.  LADEE\222s body mount panels are r ight next to the payloads; for protection, all instruments were shielded with reflective blankets.  LADEE\222s star trackers can withstand sunlight, and did not require protection  Personnel Safety 227 Regarding personnel safety, precautions were necessary.  On e of the strengths of the metal halide bulb is less infrared and more UV; unfortunately human eyes are sensitive to UV radiation.  Further, the light reflects easily and can cause headaches even when personnel avoid looking at the bulb.  Fortunately, an in expensive, stock solution was available.  Most standard safety glasses meet the ANSI Z87.1 standard for UV protection.  Welding glasses also meet the standard, and often provide fitted wrap around protection.  To meet personnel safety, the project purchased a dozen glasses and required all personnel to wear them during test. [7  D eb r i ef s a n d p l acar d s s er v e t o  notify all staff   5  T EST R ESULTS  The first test occurred just after final observatory integration, and was straightforward to execute.  The test tim e was about four hours, and required three staff to operate.  The EPS 4 295W requirement was not met due to de rating the lamp.  Figures 9 and 10 are time series of all panel currents and temperature sensors during the test Figure 11 shows a typical \221ste p\222 current signature for each panel type.  Note the signature shows evidence that the lamp warm up persists beyond one minute.  All panels measured above the 0.5A requirement, with most between 70 75% of maximum.  Typical panel temperatures hovered around 45\272 Celsius \(Figure 12\, with the hottest at about 59\272 Celsius The test was considered a success, and LADEE Risk #87 was subsequently closed  LADEE project management was sufficiently happy with the test that it approved purchase of a new lamp system The test proved to be simple enough in execution that the test rig could be taken to the launch site for evaluation prior to encapsulation.  At t he final observatory test \(Figure 13 the team attempted verification of the 295W requirement Enough thermal margin was available to relax the generated current de rating from 25% to roughly 10%.  Recall that only one panel can be tested at a time; anal ysis combines superposition of results with the spacecraft rotation and orientation outlined in Figure 3.  The average observatory power generation meets the 295W requirement \(Table 4 Three sides of the spacecraft fell less than 10% short of the require ment.  However, the level of residual risk was considered appropriate for a Class D mission and no further testing was required  Table 4:  EPS 4 Closed by Test  Minimum Power  Maximum Power  Average Power  Requirement  270.9W  339.7W  310.4W  295W     Figure 9:  Solar Array Test Currents

   10   Figure 12:  Infrared Image of a Panel during Test   Figure 13:  Final LADEE Test   6  M AINTENANCE   I NSPECTION   AND R EPAIR  Receiving Inspection  Beyond testing, the LADEE team used tried and true methods of visual inspection and record keeping from receipt through launch.  The panel vendor accompanied the initial delivery of hardware to NASA ARC and participated in an on site inspection, thereby do cumenting the initial state of the hardware.  Throughout during Integration and Test \(I&T\, the LADEE test team performed their own visual inspections of the hardware.  This best practice resulted in the discovery of two panels with minor damage  Launch Site Inspection  Following shipment to the launch facility \(NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia\, the manufacturer performed an on site inspection and repair of the panels.  Roughly 15% of the array was found to have minor cracks and damage due to  handling \(Figure 14\.  During an extended stay at Wallops Island, the repair team was able to fix all affected panels with no issues \(Figure 15\.  The simplicity, portability, and ease of operation of the lamp test fixture made it easy to re evaluate all repaired panels prior to launch.  Note the inspections and final test were not part of the project\222s original \(observatory LAPSS test\ plan   Figure 14:  Damaged LADEE Solar Cell   Figure 15:  Cell Repair at the Launch Facility   7  M ISSION O PERATIONS  A ma jor assumption that enabled the entire risk mitigation process was the allocation of manufacturer\222s per panel LAPSS data for requirements verification, LADEE EPS modeling and mission operations tools.  Several factors can invalidate that assumption.  One obviously, is any damage and repair that could occur prior to launch.  Another is degradation; though LADEE is a short lifetime mission some level of radiation or micro meteorite damage will occur.  A final factor, shadowing, is less a function of the pan els themselves than the spacecraft geometry Protrusions in the spacecraft will tend to shadow portions of the array, and predicting that behavior can be extremely complex.  Neither the lamp test nor a LAPSS would completely account for shadowing.  All of  these factors feed into the need to continuously evaluate the health and performance of the solar array through mission operations  


   11 This would be relatively simple if the spacecraft\222s COTS avionics measured current from each panel, or even each switch.  Unfortunately this is not the case; only one measurement is made for the entire solar array system This design approach, while appropriate for a low complexity Class D system, is highly inconvenient for debugging any type of photovoltaic system failure   During Operational Readiness Training \(ORTs\, the LADEE EPS team developed a method to evaluate panel performance throughout the mission.  The approach illuminates the interdisciplinary nature and value of mission operations experience, even for the hardware designer.  In this case, the ORT campaign engendered collaboration between the EPS and Guidance, Navigation, and Control GNC\ teams that led to a solution.  The EPS team discovered that the GNC system design includes calculation and storage of the spacecraft sun vector as part of its attitude determination process.  As mentioned, the EPS subsystem records the solar array current and number of closed switches.  The EPS analysis tool simply combines the downlinked sun vector with the EPS data and a ge ometrical spacecraft model to determine an expected array current and the derived error \(Figure 16\.  Observation of the spacecraft over a combination of attitudes can be used to back out the behavior of individual panels, thereby updating the manufacture r\222s data   8  C ONCLUSIONS  The LADEE program applied true Class D risk tracking and mitigation techniques to address a major technical risk.  A project decision driven by resources, combined with redefinition of risk metrics, forced its staff to reconsider st andard practices and determine what was really necessary The process of test research development, execution, and risk closure took roughly 10 weeks \(Figure 5\.  The total cost was roughly 12% of the industry standard \(LAPSS solution in materials costs  and 12 labor hours per test Further, the theatre lamp approach is easy to train with and portable.  When combined with standard visual inspection it actually added value over the LAPSS approach in this application.  The test proved the system met powe r generation requirements 6 weeks prior to launch.  Post launch, interdisciplinary approaches proved useful to track performance of the array in flight.  Finally, the entire approach can be easily handed down to future missions   A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work  was performed under the direction of Joseph Camisa, who served as the LADEE EPS Lead until his retirement in mid 2013.  Additional notes of appreciation go to the NASA GSFC Power Group \(Code 563\, the Emcore inspection and repair staff, and the LADEE Syst ems Engineering, Project Management, and Integration and Test teams for their participation in this work        Figure 16 226 Mission Operations Tool Overlays Expected and Actual Generated Array Current
