large number of instances the computational time r equired to apply Genetic Algorithms f or generating Fuzzy Rule-Based Classi\002ers increases considerably  mainly due to the 002tness e v aluation Another important problem associated to these kinds of data sets is an undesired increase of the obtained model complexity  These tw o problems can be addressed by using Instance Selection techniques which aim to obtain a r epresentati v e subset of input data with a lo wer size with r espect to the original set while maintaining or e v en impr o ving the classi\002cation accuracy f or new input data The aim of th is study is to analyze a wide range of Instance Selection techniques together with a Genetic Fuzzy Rule-Based Classi\002cation system namely the Fuzzy Association Rule-Based Classi\002cation Model f or High-Dimension al Problems in order to disco v er which r eduction method or family of methods outperforms the others The r esults on 36 differ ent I nstance Selection methods sho w that a particular family of them is v ery pr omising since the complexity of the obtained models is signi\002cantly decr eased while accuracy is maintained in comparison with the original model without Instance Selection This pr o vides a 002rst experimental framew ork f or further de v elopments on this type of methods which seems to be v ery appropriate f or I nstance Selection on classi\002cation problems addressed by applying e v olutionary lear ning of linguistic Fuzzy Rule-Based Classi\002ers as a kind of pr e-pr ocessing that can help to signi\002cantly decr ease the complexity of the obtained models I  I NT R ODU C T I ON A classi\002cation proble m consists of a set P of objects to be classi\002ed and a set L of labels or classes to be assigned to them The aim is to assign one label to each object so that the input-output relationship is consistent with the set of observ ed data describing the problem Classi\002cation problems can be addressed by using different approaches An interesting possib i lity is using Fuzzy RuleBased Classi\002ers FRBCs which perform the classi\002cation Supported by the Spanish CICYT Project TIN2011-28488 the Andalusian Excellence Re gional Project TIC-6858 and t he European Project 238819 under FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-2008 Marie Curie Action Netw orks for Initial T raining task by means of fuzzy rules usually associated to linguistic terms The automatic generation of this kind of Fuzzy RuleBased Systems FRBSs from data samples can be considered as an optimization or search process that can be managed by using Ev olutionary Algorithms EAs and in particular Genetic Algorithms GAs  2 GAs ha v e been so e xtensi v ely and successfully applied to learn FRBSs in recent years that the term Genetic Fuzzy Systems GFSs has been introduced to denote them  4 5 The optimization process aims t o 002nd the appropriate FRBS structure and parameters by coding them or a part as chromosomes that e volv e in order to 002nd the optimum with respect to a 002tness function typically an error associated to the system One of the major dra wbacks in learning linguistic FRBSs when considering datasets with a large number of instances is the 002nal complexity of the obtained models since learning techniques usually tak e into account all the instances and try to co ver all of them Further  the computational time required by the 002tness e v aluation could be a problem in the particular case of using GAs Ho we ver  we w ould lik e to point out this latter is not the main aim of our contribution since scalability issues can be addres sed by considering appropriate scalable GFSs  7 Many different approaches ha v e been used to address these problems F or e xample data reduction techniques aim to obtain a representati v e subset of input data which has a lower size than the original one b ut can pro vide a similar or e v en higher classi\002cat ion accurac y for new input data Data reduction processes can be performed in se v eral manners e.g with Instance Selection IS techniques  9 which can be di vided into tw o types depending on the aim pursued by the reduction if the set of selected instances will be used as the reference data to instance-based classi\002cation then the approach is called Prototype Selection PS 10 On the other hand if the subset will be used as input or training set of an y data mining algorithm for building a model then the approach U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright WCCI 2012 IEEE World Congress on Computational

rules inherent in a database 2 selecting a small set of rele v ant association rules to construct a classi\002er  Association rules are e xpressions of the type A  B  where A and B are sets of items and A  B  013  This implies that if all the items in A e xist in a transaction then all the items in B with a high probability are also in the transaction and A and B ha v e no common item Fuzzy association rules 18 are a generalization of association rules and e xtend the types of relationships that may be represented f acilitate the interpretation of rules in linguistic terms and a void unnatural boundaries in the partitioning of attribute domains 19 The FARC-HD method aims to learn FRBCs that include a compact set of fuzzy association rules and present high classi\002cation accurac y  with a low computational cost The method is based on t h r ee stages which will be brie\003y described in the follo wing subsections A Stag e 1 Fuzzy Association Rule Extraction In the 002 rst stage a search tree is used to list all the possible fuzzy itemsets of a class The root or le v el 0 of a search tree is an empty set All attributes are assumed to ha v e an order  002rst setting the fuzzy items of the 002rst v ariable then the fuzzy items of the second v ariable and so on The oneitemsets corresponding to the attributes are listed in the 002rst le v el of the search tree according to their order  The children of an one-item node for an attribute A are the tw o-itemsets that include the one-itemset of attribute A and an one-itemset for another attribute after attribute A in the order  and so on No repeated itemset appears in the tree Each itemset is e v aluated with respect to a minimum support and a minimum con\002dence an itemset with a support higher than the minimum support is a frequent itemset and an itemset with a con\002dence higher than the con\002dence's threshold has reached the quality le v el demanded by the user  Therefore if the support of an n-itemset in a node A is lower than the minimum support it does not need to be e xtended more Lik e wise if a candidate item set generates a classi\002cation rule with con\002dence higher than the minimum con\002dence it is again unnecessary to e xtend it further  Once all frequent fuzzy itemsets ha v e been obtained the candidate fuzzy associat ion rules are generated by setting the frequent fuzzy itemsets in the antecedent of the rules and the corresponding class in the consequent and this process is repeated for each class The number of frequent fuzzy itemsets e xtracted depends directly on the minimum support which is de\002ned for each class using the distributions of the classes o ver the dat a set This stage generates a large number of rules which can hardly handled by human users T o simplify the understanding of the model the depth of the trees and so the length of the fuzzy rules is limited to a 002x ed v alue B Stag e 2 Candidate Rule Pr escreening Ev en though the order of the associations is limited in the association rule e xtraction the number of rules generated can be very lar ge In order to decrease the computational cost of the genetic post processing stage the use of subgroup disco very based on an improv ed weighted relati v e accurac y measure wWRAcc is considered to preselect the most interesting rules by means of a pattern weighting scheme 20 This scheme treats the patterns in such a way that co vered positi v e patterns are not deleted when the current best rule is selected Instead each time a rule is selected the algorithm stores a count i for each pattern of ho w many times with ho w many of the selected rules the pattern has been co vered W eights of positi v e patterns co vered by the selected rule decrease according to the formula w  e j  i   1 i 1  In the 002rst iteration the same weight w  e j  0  1 is assigned to all target class patter ns while in the follo wing iterations the contrib utions of patterns are in v ersely proportional to their co v erage by previously selected rules In this way the patterns already co vered by one or more selected rules decrease their weights while uncovered target class patterns whose weights ha v e not been decreased will ha v e a greater chance of being co vered in the follo wing iterations Covered patterns are completely eliminated when the y ha v e been co vered more than k t times Thus in each iteration of the process the rules are ordered according to a rule e v aluation criteria from the best to the 


w orst The best rule is selected co vered patterns are reweighted and the procedure repeats these steps until one of the stopping criteria is achie v ed either all patterns ha v e been co vered more than k t times or there are no more rules in the Rule Base RB This process is repeated for each class C Stag e 3 Rule Selection and Lateral T uning A GA is used to perform a rule selection process and a tuning process which are applied to the RB generated by the previous stage The rules are described by means of the linguistic 2-tuple representation 21 which allows the lateral displacement of the labels by adopting only one parameter  This implies a simpli\002cation of the tuning search space that eases the deriv ation of optimal models In this way  membership functions achie v e a better co vering de gree while maintaining the original shapes Thus accurac y is increased without a signi\002cant loss in the interpretability of the fuzzy labels In this approach the t uning is applied to the le v el of linguistic partitions global approach so that the pair  X i  l abel  takes the same 013 displacement v alue in all the rules where it is considered In the following the main characteristics of the genetic approach are presented a genetic model b codi\002cation and initial gene pool c chromosome e v aluation d crossover operator and e restarting approach a CHC Genetic Model the approach proposed in 22 considers the use of a speci\002c GA namely the CHC algorithm 23 This genetic model employs a mechanism of selection of populations so as to perform an adequate global search P parents and their corresponding of fspring compete to select the best P individuals which will tak e part in the next population The CHC approach mak es use of an incest prev ention mechanism and a restarting process to encourage di v ersity in the population instead of the well known mutation operator  b Codi\002cation and Initial Gene P ool to combine the rule selection with the global lateral tuning a double coding scheme for both rule selection  C S  and lateral tuning  C T  is used 017 F or the C S part each chromosome is a binary v ector that determines when a rule is selected or not 017 F or the C T part a real coding is considered This part is the joint of the 013 parameters of each fuzzy partition Finally  the whole chromosome C is coded in the follo wing way C  C S C T  T o mak e use of the a v ailable information all the candidate rules are included in the population as an initial solution c Chr omosome Evaluation to e v aluate a determined chromosome penalizing a large number of rules the classi\002cation rate is computed and the follo wing function is maximized F itness  C    H its N 000 016 001 N R initial N R initial 000 N R  1  0  1 where  H its is the number of patterns correctly classi\002ed N R initial is the number of candidate rules N R is the number of selected rules and 016 is a weighting percentage gi v en by the system e xpert that determines the trade-of f between accurac y and complexity  If there is at least one class without selected rules or if there are no co vered patterns the 002tness v alue of a chromosome will be penalized with the number of classes without selected rules and the number of uncovered patterns d Crosso ver Oper ator the crossover operator depends on the chromosome part where it is applied 017 for the C T part the Parent Centric BLX PCBLX oper ator is considered an operator based on BLX\013  This operator is based on the concept of neighborhood which allows the of fspring genes to be around the genes of one parent or around a wide zone determined by both parent genes 017 In the C S part the half uniform crossover scheme HUX is used The HUX crossover e xactly interchanges the mid of the alleles that are different in the parents the genes to be crossed are randomly selected from among those that are different in the parents This operat or ensures the maximum distance of the of fspring to their parents exploration In this case four of fspring are generated by combining the tw o from the part C T with the tw o from the part C S  The tw o best of fspring obtained in this way are considered as the tw o corresponding descendants e Restarting Approac h to get a way from local optima this algorithm uses a restart approach In this case the best chromosome is maintained and the remaining are generated at random The restart p r ocedure is applied when a threshold v alue L is below zero which means that all the individuals coexisting in the population are very similar  I V  E X P E R IM ENTAL R E S UL T

augmented naive Bayesian networks as a basis for performance diagnosis Their work is different from ours in the way we detect the possible performance improvement As we combine several rules our approach is capable of giving a more detailed analysis of the location of the improvement Syer et al use co v ariance matrices to detect de viations in thread pools that indicate possible performance problems The focus of their approach is on thread pools while ours is not limited to a particular architectural pattern Malik et al ha v e presented an approach for narro wing down the set of performance counters that have to be monitored to automatically compare load tests by using statistics Their technique also ranks the performance counters based on their importance for load tests Their work focuses on selecting metrics i.e the dimension reduction problem while our work focuses on analyzing those metrics instead Jiang et al analyze log 002les to see if the results of a new load test deviate from previous ones This allows developers to analyze the impact of their changes Nguyen et al address a similar problem namely the problem of 002nding performance regressions The focus of these approaches is on analyzing whether a change had the desired effect on performance while our approach focuses on 002nding what to change Pro\002ling Pro\002lers are tools which collect run-time information about software such as the amount of memory used or the number of instructions executed More advanced pro\002lers analyze the run-time bloat e.g unnecessary new object creations Pro\002lers assist system administrators in the way that they help identify the block or method which uses the most resources and hence may form a bottleneck Bergel et al e xtend pro\002ling with the possibility to detect opportunities for code optimization Using visualizations they advise developers on how to refactor code so that it will run faster Their advice is based on principles such as making often called functions faster In general while there are methods for decreasing the amount of data and instrumentation 21 e x ecution pro\002ling introduces considerable overhead due to the large amount of data that needs to be monitored In addition because pro\002lers usually analyze hot code e.g the code that uses the most CPU cycles they are not always directly suitable for detecting all possible performance improvements Finally  it is possible that man y sites must be monitored in a distributed environment Therefore while execution pro\002ling plays an important role in performance maintenance its use should be minimally Our approach can assist in reducing the execution pro\002ling overhead by pinpointing the hardware on which pro\002ling should be done Using Heat Maps for Performance Maintenance Heat maps have been used for performance analysis before  b ut we ha v e e v aluated our approach in an industrial setting and on multi-server data IX C ONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed a technique for detecting performance improvement opportunities PIOs using association rules and performance counter measurements We have implemented this technique together with several novel techniques for the visualization of performance data in an open source tool called W EDJAT  We have evaluated W EDJAT  the novel visualization methods and our approach in a 002eld user study with three performance experts from industry for a large-scale industrial SaaS application The results of the user study show that W EDJAT helps them to perform performance maintenance easier and faster In short our paper makes the following contributions 017 An approach for using heat maps to analyze the performance of a system and exploit performance improvement opportunities 017 The open source tool W EDJAT  which assists during the performance maintenance process 017 A 002eld user study in which W EDJAT and the idea of using heat maps for performance analysis are evaluated by three performance experts from industry In future work we will focus on improving the usability of W EDJAT and the coverage of the used rule set In addition we will keep on extending W EDJAT with several new visualization methods Finally we will perform a more extended evaluation of our approach in which we will a do a true/false positive/negative analysis of our results and b assign more complex tasks to solve to the experts ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors would like to thank Exact for providing the funds and opportunity to perform this research Further support came from

Figure 6 is not as signicant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
