Automatic User Steering for Interactive Data Exploration Kyriaki Dimitriadou Brandeis University Waltham MA USA f kiki g cs.brandeis.edu s upervised by Olga Papaemmanouil Abstract 227The amount of data that have 003ooded databases during the last few years have created several new problems for the data management community to address One of the most prominent is the discovery of new and interesting information that is hidden in the underlying big data sets As of now in order to explore these data sets users begin with a few general queries 
study their output and iteratively issue more speci\002c ones until they discover interesting information This is an onerous process that requires time and effort In this thesis we are developing an automatic data exploration framework that will make the discovery of new information in a vast data space both effective and ef\002cient Our system asks users for their relevance feedback on strategically collected samples in an interactive manner steers them towards the interesting parts of the database and eventually formulates the query that retrieves their data of interest Our preliminary results are encouraging and allow us to persevere in the development of such a system 
I I NTRODUCTION Traditionally data management applications are designed around the archetype that users have a clear and precise idea of their dataset and know exactly the knowledge they want to gain out of their data However as the amount of data increases scientists do not have such a clear understanding of the underlying database Thus a new type of applications has emerged namely Interactive Data Exploration IDE applications where users iteratively issue multiple queries with varying predicates until they are led to discover interesting information These 224exploratory sessions\224 can last many hours and even days and can be detrimental to human productivity 
and resource conservation As an example of an IDE application the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which maps the sk y  has g athered up to no w approximately 1328 TB of data and includes information for around 260 million stars and 208 million galaxies To make sense of this data scientists start with a few general queries with high selectivity study the query results re\002ne their queries based on those results and decide what their next query will be They iteratively perform this long-running multi-step process until they are satis\002ed with their 002ndings in which case they can draw their 002nal conclusions There are several problems in the above process that scientists have to deal with Due to the vast exploration 
space scientists do not clearly comprehend the contents of the database and thus it becomes very dif\002cult to identify the exact data objects they are interested in Furthermore writing a query to retrieve the interesting data can still be hard when the schema of the database and the data itself are very complex or when the user has poor query writing skills In addition to that due to the lack of proper tuning user queries have a long response time which slows down the process of exploration Finally manually reviewing returned query results and identifying the relevant data objects before making a decision about the next steps further increases the user effort and overall overhead of the exploration process 
because query replies can be too large and/or unsatisfying Motivated by these problems we envision a system that will address the above challenges of big data exploration and will eliminate the need for expensive ad-hoc exploratory queries In a nutshell our system will navigate users through the database and will steer them towards the 223trajectories\224 of the data that are of most interest to them To achieve that the system will iteratively ask the users for their relevance feedback on selected tuples will generate a model that predicts their interests using machine learning algorithms and will 002nally formulate a selection query that retrieves all the relevant data to their search 
Our research aims to integrate machine learning algorithms and database optimization techniques in the task of interactive data exploration While machine learning algorithms can be used to model user interests they are not concerned with how to steer users along interesting trajectories or how to minimize the cost of data acquisition to improve the user interactive experience Our system addresses these drawbacks by leveraging the unique characteristics of exploration workloads In this thesis we will develop a suite of algorithms and techniques that draw insights from machine learning algorithms to guide the exploration of a big data space and leverage the knowledge of exploration patterns to optimize query processing inside the 
database II A PPROACH Our system explores the data space by iteratively showing to the user strategically selected tuples and letting the user decide if those are interesting or not to him After the user classi\002es these tuples the system uses machine learning techniques and speci\002cally decision trees to classify the rest of the data space to interesting and non-interesting areas and formulates a query that projects the user's interests based on the information

Fig 1 Automatic Interactive Data Exploration Framework that he has provided In each iteration the system strives to select the appropriate tuples to show to the user aiming to improve the accuracy of the formulated query The user can explicitly stop this process whenever he feels satis\002ed with the query that the system has formulated In the next section we provide a more detailed description of the various steps of our framework Figure 1 A Interactive Automatic Data Exploration Initially the system chooses a 002rst batch of samples from the entire data space to show to the user Initial Sample Acquisition and the user is asked to provide his feedback on this set of samples User Relevance Feedback  Our relevance feedback system is binary an item can only be classi\002ed as relevant or irrelevant The labeled samples are used as an input training set to our data classi\002cation algorithm Our system uses a decision tree algorithm to predict a model that classi\002es the whole database as relevant/irrelevant to the user based on that training set Data Classi\002cation  The model that the decision tree generates is expressed in simple classi\002cation rules which can be then interpreted to a query that selects the objects that are relevant to the user's search In Figure 2 we can see an example decision tree based on the SDSS data and its translation to a selection query This decision tree is generated for a user that is interested in galaxies with brightness in the red wavelength between 13.55 and 14.82 and in the green wavelength smaller than 13.74 For the moment we assume numerical attributes while future work will focus on categorical data as well At this point the user could possibly stop the process if he was satis\002ed with the query that the system formulated in this iteration If that is not the case then the system needs to build a more accurate query to re\003ect the user's interest To achieve that the system needs more feedback from the user on a different set of samples Selecting this next batch of samples is crucial these samples need to be the most informative and accuracy yielding samples in the whole data space In order to 002nd them the system launches a series of space exploration steps explained below with each step returning the appropriate samples from the database Space Exploration  After the system identi\002es the new sampling set it presents it to the user for labeling at which point a decision tree is generated based on all of the samples that the user has labeled up to this iteration Fig 2 Translation of a decision tree to a selection query When the iterative process completes the system translates the 002nal model built by the decision tree classi\002er into the user's extraction query that retrieves all the data that are characterized as relevant to him B Space Exploration Phases In order to ef\002ciently and effectively explore the data space the system deploys three phases which build upon each other the Object Discovery phase the Misclassi\002ed Exploitation phase and the Boundary Re\002nement phase Object Discovery Phase The objective of this phase is to identify new interesting data objects from unexplored areas of the data space These objects need to be well distributed in the data space so that the user can examine representative tuples from as many different areas as possible To achieve this we divide the data space into g equal width grids where each grid de\002nes a different data area and we select one random tuple close to the center of each grid to represent this area to the user for labeling The number of grids we are going to construct depends on the number of samples we want to spend on this phase If our exploration space consists of d attributes and the number of samples we have for this phase is n then we want to break down the domain of each attribute into b  d p  n equal width ranges to build the g grids here g  n since we select one tuple from each grid For our system we keep a pre-built set of grids with different values for b to satisfy users that wish to invest different levels of effort in the system If a user has labeled all the samples for the grids built with value b 0 and he wishes to further explore in more depth the data space then we carry on to present the user with the next set of tuples drawn from the grids where b 1  b 0  Misclassi\002ed Exploitation Phase The previous phase identi\002es single points of interests one per each grid explored The Misclassi\002ed Exploitation phase leverages this information in order to turn these points of interest into areas of interest by increasing the relevant samples in our training set Typically the classi\002cation rules that a decision tree outputs contain a prediction error meaning that a subset of the training samples will be misclassi\002ed i.e the decision tree assigns them to the opposite class It is usually the case that points of interest discovered from the previous phase get misclassi\002ed as irrelevant because the irrelevant class dominates our sample set Therefore we need to reinforce our training set with more 321 


tuples that are similar to the interesting misclassi\002ed tuples  false negatives  in order to provide enough information to the decision tree to formulate the interesting areas In our framework we measure similarity in terms of distance we assume that interesting tuples will be located close to each other in the data space forming interesting areas Thus this phase selects a number of random tuples around each false negative sample to present to the user In this fashion we strive to increase in the next iteration our training set with samples from the relevant class by having the user examine and classify objects that are similar to his interesting ones Boundary Re\002nement This last step adds samples to our training set that improve the accuracy of an already built decision tree by striving to re\002ne the boundaries that separate the two different classes of data relevant and irrelevant To achieve this we represent boundaries as hyperectangles in a multidimensional space de\002ned by the classi\002cation rules of the decision tree and we aim to iteratively re\002ne these boundaries by selecting samples that belong to both classes Such samples are located around the boundaries of the formulated relevant hyperectangles Therefore given a set of boundaries we collect random samples across the domain of each attribute in our data space making sure that each sample is in close proximity to the boundary of the relevant area This approach is applied across all the boundaries of the relevant hyperectangles allowing us to shrink/expand each dimension of the relevant areas Our optimizations include dynamically regulating the number s of samples we gather around each boundary and progressively adapting our sampling areas in each iteration As the percentage of change of a boundary increases from one iteration to the other so does s since this reveals that the boundary is not correctly de\002ned yet and we need more samples to re\002ne it Moreover we avoid sampling areas that have high overlap in between iterations in order to present the user varying samples from different data areas In this way we increase the accuracy of the 002nal query we formulate for him III P RELIMINARY R ESULTS Queries We performed a preliminary set of experiments on a real data set drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey For our experimental purposes we studied the query workload issued to the SDSS database over a period of time We observed that 90 of the queries issued to the database selected one single area of interest and that the predicates used in these queries had an average coverage of 3.4 of their domain Thus in our target query set we included queries that select one area with domain coverage i.e relevant area size between 1-9 Speci\002cally we experimented with small  medium and large relevant areas Small areas have attribute ranges with average width of 1-3 of their normalized domain while medium areas have width 4-6 and large ones have 7-9 Experimental Setup We implemented our framework on JVM 1.7 and run our experiments on an Intel PowerEdge R320 server with 32GB RAM The database size we used is 11GB and our exploration space had 2 attributes A covering index Fig 3 Predicted query accuracy for increasing complexity of one relevant area was also used that included these attributes The database we used is MySQL 5.5.32 Evaluation Metrics In our experiments we measure effectiveness using the F measure metric which is the harmonic mean of the recall i.e percent of relevant objects we retrieve and precision i.e percent of irrelevant objects we retrieve of our 002nal extraction query In our experiments we report the F measure we converge to when the use has classi\002ed up to N number of tuples User Simulation Given a target query we simulate the user by executing the query to collect the exact target set of relevant tuples We use this set to label the new sample set we extract in each iteration as relevant or irrelevant depending on whether they are included in it or not Moreover we use this set to evaluate the accuracy of our 002nal predicted extraction queries Results Our preliminary results are really encouraging Figure 3 reveals the F measure of our predicted query when we increase the target query complexity by varying the size of the relevant area from large to medium and small  Naturally labeling more samples improves in all cases the accuracy As we can see with only 200 tuples we achieve an F measure higher than 60 and with labeling 400 samples we reach an F measure higher than 89 for the less complex case of a large relevant area As the query complexity increases the user needs to label more samples at least 800 for small areas and 600 for medium areas to get highly accurate predictions greater than 82 but even an acceptable set of 400 samples offers accuracy higher than 60 in all cases These numbers show a great improvement over the thousands of objects scientists need to review before ending up with their 002nal query that selects their data of interest in our experiments our target query selectivities range between 2  957 000 26  817 objects The results regarding the user's wait time in between iterations are also motivating Our system performs better when the size of the relevant area is small with an average of 1.2 secs wait time per iteration As the size of the relevant area increases to medium the average time per iteration increases to 1.5 secs and 002nally when the size of the relevant area is large the overhead raises to an average of 1.8 secs This small extra time when we are dealing with less complex queries leads to a higher accuracy Due to space limitation we omit this graph IV C HALLENGES  F UTURE D IRECTIONS In this section we brie\003y sketch some of the future directions we plan to undertake in our research 322 


Interactivity Providing an interactive experience to the user is a prerequisite for our system Since each of our three exploration phases Section II-B increases our labeled sample set with new tuples using queries to retrieve them from the database these queries need to return results as fast as possible in order for the user's wait time in between iterations to be minimal One direction we plan to take to achieve that is sampling The queries for all of our three phases select random tuples from different areas of the data space The amount of data that exist in those areas is not important to our cause as long as a few exist for the user to label In fact the less data that exist in the data space the faster our queries are going to run Therefore this offers us a great chance to study various sampling techniques to minimize the volume of the data and expedite our queries but without a loss in the accuracy of the 002nal query we formulate for the user Although sampling has been studied before in order to approximately answer queries 3 4 it presents a ne w challenge in our setting since the query workload that our phases generate is unique and different from what previous works in the 002eld have studied Past User Interactions Past user interactions with the system create a wealth of information that if studied and used carefully could possibly help with the 223exploratory sessions\224 of new users For example if we deem that the exploration paths queries that are generated in each iteration of two users are similar then we can use the knowledge we have gained from the 002rst user to jump ahead in the exploratory session of the other user and predict data trajectories or more attributes that could be interesting to him Furthermore user interaction histories could be used to proactively fetch and cache samples from the database and in that way speed up the data exploration of new users Multiple aspects of query workloads as a sequence have been studied in the past  ho we v er within our frame w ork we ha v e the chance to develop new optimization algorithms that harness interaction histories to facilitate interactive data exploration Understanding the Query Output A signi\002cant part in the exploration process is to help the user understand the data that the predicted query is selecting for him This is important in order to assist the user in drawing conclusions regarding the selected data Furthermore it would help him label the next set of samples if he is not satis\002ed with his conclusions and he wishes to continue the process Towards this goal the system should provide insightful statistics about the areas that the user is interested in such as the average of speci\002c columns min max sum etc based on indications by the user or previous similar queries related to these areas helping him in that way to get a clearer view of the data the formulated query has selected for him Although query suggestions based on previous queries have been studied before we belie v e that turning those previous queries to useful information about the predicted areas and doing so interactively offers a promising research direction Furthermore retrieving statistics regarding the formulated areas means issuing more queries to the database which will be a challenge to achieve without affecting the user's wait time in between iterations Data Visualization Data visualization is a natural extension of an exploration system such as the one described here When coming to graphical interface graphs and images are easier to mentally grasp than raw text and numbers Therefore a research challenge would be to try to visualize samples and present them for labeling to the user in an easily comprehensible format For example data that deal with geographical information could be presented to the user as points on a map or data that contain chronological information could be directly visualized as points on a time chart Data visualization has seen signi\002cant support by the data management community ho we v er the main challenge in our set ting w ould be to try and integrate data visualization into our system given its interactive and multi-dimensional character V R ELATED W ORK A related body of work focuses on the development of 223Query-By-Example\224 and front-end interf aces that assist in query formulation These systems do not attempt to understand user interests and to retrieve 223similar\224 data tuples Query relaxation techniques have also been proposed for database exploration 12 13 14 These solutions focus on adjusting the query parameters to reach a cardinality goal and therefore cannot characterize user interests or reduce the number of tuples shown to the user for labeling Moreover relevance feedback techniques have been studied in the 002eld of active learning but they target different types of data ranking of documents e.g image retrie v al 16 and usually examine each sample in the database before presenting it to the user which is not feasible in the case of an interactive system In the y f acilitate query formulation using past SQL query templates Idreos et al present a vision towards a system for interactive data processing tasks that reduces the time spent on data analysis These works do not focus on predicting user interests or 223similar\224 data tuples In the y require the user to specify in adv ance the attributes and value assignments used to learn queries which are assumptions we cannot make in our work Finally our vision for automatic interactive navigation in databases was 002rst introduced in VI C ONCLUSIONS We described an automatic data exploration system that is crucial for identifying interesting data objects in huge and complex datasets that one encounters in many big data applications Our system signi\002cantly reduces human effort on data exploration as users are methodically steered through the data by providing their feedback on selected samples Such automated steering fully exploiting user interests while grounded in rigorous learning theory assists users in discovering new interesting data patterns It also eliminates expensive ad-hoc exploratory queries leading to further improvements in user productivity and resource conservation 323
