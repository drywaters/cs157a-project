There is an increasing demand for multimedia processing solutions through flexible and highly parallel architectures H.264 [1  v i d e o  c o m p re s s i o n  s t a n d a rd  p l a y s  a n  i m p o rt a n t  ro l e  i n  today\222s consumer market Motion estimation ME is a key technique in most algorithms for video compression. It is one of the most compute intensive subroutines of H.264. Compared to fixed block-size ME FBSME H.264 supports VBSME 2  which provides better estimation of small and irregular motion fields and allows better adaptation of motion boundaries 
resulting in a reduced number of bits required for coding prediction. In motion estimation, each frame of a video sequence is divided into fixed number of non-overlapping square blocks For each block in current frame, best matching block is searched within the previous frame In most block matching algorithms the sum of absolute differences SAD is used as the main metric VBSME requires support for 7 block patterns 16x16 16x8 8x8 8x4 4x8 4x4 Supporting this feature is a challenging task in terms of resource utilization when implementing the application on hardware Due to its highly parallel nature and algorithm\222s demand for a flexible solution, a reconfigurable architecture poses as an ideal candidate to respond to this compute intensive routine 
Based on the historical perspective implementation of motion estimation has evolved through general purpose processors[3  4   5    A S IC 5   6   7   8   9    F P G A  1 0    a n d  coarse grained reconfigurable architectures [11   1 2    1 3     1 4    Existing architectures either only support FBSME or implement VBSME with redundant hardware While new processor advances including VLIW SIMD and out of order execution have provided some advances in exploiting parallelism within applications the processor\222s inherently sequential and generic architecture limits the ability to efficiently exploit potential parallelism within highly concurrent types of algorithms Alternatively application specific instruction set processors ASIPs allow designers to custom the microprocessor by 
adding custom instructions and execution units within the processor However such extensions are similar to VLIW or SIMD approaches and are still limited to the data access through the processor\222s register file Several ASIC based approaches have been proposed for variable block size block matching algorithms to reduce computational complexities However some of these architectures 5   6    7   are not capable of processing all the block sizes specified by the H.264. As an alternative, Yap [8  p ro m i s e s  t o  s u p p o rt  a l l  b l o c k  sizes Architecture is formed of 16 processing elements PEs interconnected as a 1D systolic array where each PE computes a 4x4 SAD.

Therefore this architecture has high area overhead which can be improved by using a flexible routing architecture Coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures RaPiD[14   MATRIX[12   Ch E S S  1 3    RA W  1 1   h a v e  b e e n  i n t ro d u c e d  t o  overcome some of the drawbacks of lookup table based finegrained reconfigurable architectures, such as FPGAs.

level processing elements PEs with generic reconfigurable interconnect network. While fewer configuration bits are needed for the PEs fully utilizing the functionality of each PE is difficult leading to significant under utilization of coarsegrained fabrics. This can be avoided by tailoring the architecture to the computation characteristics of the algorithm with application specific hybrid grained processing elements interconnected through a tuned routing architecture 


In sections 2 and 3 we give an overview of existing ASIC and coarse grained architectures and analyze their perf ormance on VBSME with respect to processing power and resource  utilization metrics Section 4 introduces the new a rchitecture section 5 presents implementation results and secti on 6 outlines the conclusion 2  ASIC BASED APPROACHES ASIC based architectures can be broadly classified into different categories depending upon various metrics such as t opology of processing elements and methodology for accumulatio n of SADs etc. Based on topology, the architecture can b e classified as 1D and 2D systolic arrays 1D architectures 8 15 16  consist of 1D systolic array of processing elements  They are simpler in structure but use a large number of regi sters for storing partial SADs and thus suffer in area and hi gh latencies owing to the sequential computation and accumulatio n of SADs 2D architectures [6, 7  c o n s i s t  o f  p r o c e s s i n g  e l e m e nts connected in a mesh-based architecture and SAD computations a re directmapped. [6  d o e s  n o t  s u p p o r t  b l o c k  s i z e s  s m a l l e r  t h an 8x8. This architecture uses a smaller 2D array So the parti al SADs are calculated and added sequentially This results in greater latencies. [7  d o e s  n o t  s u p p o r t  V B S M E   I t  u s e s  a  l a rge number of storage registers to store reference pixels Als o loading of reference pixels in the propagation registers cause s long latencies Based on methodology for accumulation of SADs the architectures can be classified as partial and para llel sum SADs In partial sum SAD architectures 6   r e f e r e n c e  p i x els are broadcasted and SAD computation for each 4x4 subblo ck is pipelined In this architecture each processing el ement computes one pixel difference accumulates it to th e previous partial SAD and sends the computed partial SAD to t he next processing element. This kind of architecture uses large number of storage registers due to the accumulation of par tial SADs in each processing element. In parallel sum SAD archit ectures, all pixel differences for a 4x4 sub-block are computed concurrently and thus added in one clock cycle. In this architec ture, reference pixels are reused between different processing elem ents which decrease memory bandwidth requirements. The directi on of data transfer among different processing elements depend s on the search pattern adopted In this paper we discuss 9  i n  d e t a i l  w h i c h  p r o m i ses to have lower latency and higher throughput over other exis ting VBSME architectures till date. [9  c o n s i s t s  o f  1 6  s eparate SAD  modules Figure 1a\  to process sixteen 4x4 motion vector s. It also consists of a chain of adders and comparators  VBSME processor to compute larger SADs  PE array  Figure 1b which forms the computation element of each SAD mod ule is constructed by cascading four 1D arrays Figure 1c  Each 1D array consists of a 1D systolic array of 4 PEs. Eac h PE computes 1 pixel SAD. This circuit operates by scheduling th e columns of the current 4x4 subblock  current_block_data_i  through a delay line and broadcasting two sets of search blo ck columns  block_strip_A and block_strip_B on each clock cycle. Four block matching operations can be performed concurre ntly in one SAD module. The produced 4x4 SADs are then sent thr ough a fixed series of adders and comparators to produce 4 x4 motion vectors The 4x4 SADs are also sent in parallel to four sets of adders and comparators to produce 4x8, 8x4 SADs. Th e two 8x4 SADs are then again sent through a set of adders an d comparators to form 8x8 SAD 16x8 8x16 and 16x16 SADs are computed similarly This adder/comparator based  chain of events form the adder tree structure 9  h a s  s e p a r a t e  S A D  m o d u l e s  f o r  4 x 4  s u b b l o c k  c o m p u tations with separate input ports for loading current block  and search region data Thus it does not support reuse of sea rch data between modules. This increases the amount of data transactions from the memory. Also, the VBSME is supported by a fixed set of adders based on a large adder tree leading to re source wastage An intelligent routing scheme that uses sa me set of adders to compute different motion vectors each tim e is needed to overcome the wastage Also this architecture do es not support other fast search algorithms like diamond s earch hexagonal search etc 3  COARSE-GRAINED ARCHITECTURES  In general coarse-grained reconfigurable fabrics a re composed of high-level functional blocks with generic reconf igurable interconnect network In this section we provide a brief review and analysis of ChESS RaPiD and MATRIX architectur es for implementing motion estimation algorithm We carefu lly chose these three architectures for an investigation base d on granularity. They vary in granularity from 4-bit, 8 bit to 16- bit processing elements and buses and thus help in prov iding a     a\ SAD Modules b\ PE Array c\  1D Array Figure 1: Hierarchical 1D systolic array architectu re with 4 processing elements \(PEs\ forming 1D arra y and 4 1D arrays forming a module  


broad view about mapping of motion estimation algor ithm on coarse-grained architectures The ChESS [13  a r c h i t e c t u r e  i s  a  r e c o n f i g u r a b l e  a r i thmetic array targeted mainly for multimedia applications The fu ndamental computation component is a 4-bit ALU with 16 instru ctions The routing structure is based on 4-bit buses. Each ALU has a switchbox adjacent to it which serves as a crosspoi nt with 64 connections  Hence it needs about 64 bits to confi gure the switches and connections. Since each ALU has a corr esponding switchbox associated with it the routing area consu mes up to 50% of the total area. If we map the motion estimat ion algorithm on the ChESS architecture and try to exploit full p arallelism SAD computation for a 16x16 array would require a 5 12 ALU ChESS array MATRIX 12  i s  y e t  a n o t h e r  c o a r s e g r a i n e d  r e c o n f i g u rable computing architecture composed of 2D array of iden tical, 8-bit functional units overlaid with a configurable netwo rk Each functional unit consists of an 8-bit ALU memory an d control logic MATRIX also has a generic routing architectu re Mapping the motion estimation algorithm on the MATR IX architecture for a 16x16 block would require a 256 ALU MATRIX array. The MATRIX array with 8-bit functiona l units would require one functional unit for one pixel dif ference calculation The performance result for motion esti mation algorithm if mapped on a 256 ALU MATRIX array is  M x 0.8M\/256 x 17 x 17  c l o c k  c y c l e s  c o n s i d e r i n g  a  f r a me size of M x 0.8M. Also, support for VBSME in these architectu res would involve huge routing complexity which is difficult to implement owing to the generic nature of routing architecture  RaPiD 14  i s  a  c o a r s e g r a i n e d  a r c h i t e c t u r e  m a i n l y  targeted for DSP applications It consists of 1D array of functi onal units ALUs, multipliers, Registers and RAMs\. The comple te RaPiD array contains 16 of these cells The functional un its cells in RaPiD are interconnected using a set of ten segment ed buses that run the length of the datapath. The buses in d ifferent tracks are segmented into different lengths. The implement ation result for motion estimation as provided in the paper for a block size of 8x8 is 272+32M+14.45M2 clock cycles considering a frame size of M x 0.8M The implementation details show t hat the available parallelism in the system has not been ex ploited to the fullest extent. For a 16x16 SAD, only the row-wise differences are computed in parallel The column wise differenc es are computed sequentially which decreases the performan ce to a great extent. This is because the linear array form of architecture fails to exploit this parallelism Also there is hu ge underutilization of resources as one cell comprisin g of 3 ALUs is being used for computing just one difference per clock cycle Though no such information has been provided in the  paper even if we assume that the second ALU is being used for adding the differences in a pipeline, the third ALU remain s unutilized Also, the ALUs are 16 bit, and the SAD computation involves 8 bit operation which again adds to underutilization  Also the reference frames considered are 8x8 So the archit ecture does not support SAD calculation for smaller block sizes  The algorithm does not require ten buses for routing. S o it leads to underutilization of routing resources too Also th e real time video performance on a standard 720 x 576 image is about 12 frames per second using 100 MHz clock. So, the perf ormance is quite poor with a huge dissipation of energy. The p aper does not talk about supporting VBSME by the architecture This analysis shows that existing generic coarse gr ained architectures are not capable of responding to the computation demands of the motion estimation algorithm Hence there is a need for application specific coarse grained archit ecture with intelligent NoC mechanism tuned for motion estimati on algorithm 4  PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE 4.1  Hybrid Architecture Overview  We propose a 2D architecture formed of three types of processing elements \(CPE, PE2 and PE3\ as shown in figure 2 Architecture contains 16 CPE”s 4 PE 2”s and 1 P E 3 Each “CPE” \(figure 3\ has a PE 1, Network Interface NI\ and a NoC router and each node is labeled as “CPE \(x,y where \(x,y represents grid coordinates Each PE2 is represente d as PE 2\(z where z identifies the processing element A“CPE  receives current and reference block from main memo ry through its 32-bit data input ports labeled as  current_data_\(x,y  and  reference_data_\(x,y where x and y are [1,2,3 or 4    In ME, given a current frame \(CF\ and its reference frame \(RF CF is first divided into non-overlapping macroblock s of size 16x16. Each macroblock associated with a search reg ion in RF is then partitioned into 16 4x4 sub-blocks labeled as \(x,y\. “PE 1 is responsible for block–matching operations SA Ds of a 4x4 sub-block and its search region PE 1 generat es a 4x4 SAD which is then fed into PE2 PE2 is capable of g enerating 4x8, 8x4 or 8x8 motion vectors based on the type of block size Similarly PE3 is capable of generating 8x16 16x8 a nd 16x16 motion vectors Architecture by default supports fu ll search data transfer between adjacent CPEs with zigzag p attern Figure 12 Other fast search algorithms like diam ond or hexagonal pattern search require reference blocks t o be transferred between adjacent/non-adjacent processin g elements Hence NI packetizes reference block data forming a  message and based on the search pattern inserts the routing information in header packet of the message. Then, NoC router t ransfers data from source PE to destination PE depending on the r outing information. This data transfer takes place through bi-directional edges between CPE”s In the following section we introduce hybrid PEs and routing mechanism and discuss their operation principles In section 4.5 we detail the functional ity of all the modules using examples Memory Interface MI CPE”s request reference blocks from main memory through MI. MI computes memory add resses of those blocks based on the search pattern It als o holds memory address of sixteen current frames that are  already in the CPEs  MI receives data_load_control 16 bits  and reference_block_id 5 bits signals where data_lo ad_control identifies the CPE and reference_block_id identifie s the requested block MI then feeds the Main Memory with  the address of that requested block 4.2  Configurable Processing Element \(CPE 4.2.1 PE 1 Figure 3 shows the structure of PE1 1,1 It is co mposed of 5 hybrid adders sixteen 8 bit subtracters sixteen 8  bit current pixel registers \(CPR\ and sixteen 8 bit reference p ixel registers RPR Subtracters calculate absolute difference be tween a 


search pixel and a current pixel. Adders then gener ate 4x4 SAD and comparator COMP checks whether the current or  the previous SAD is smaller and produces 4x4 motion vec tor If block size is larger than 4x4, then current SAD is sent to PE2 For full search, demultiplexers are used to load th e data into the RPRs based on the direction of movement in the sear ch window to support ziz-zag pattern.  For all other search p atterns data is loaded through RPRs 1, 2, 3 and 4 and propagated th rough 16 subtracters 4.2.2  Network Interface \(NI As shown in figure 3, NI contains packetization, de packetization and control units. This unit performs the following three tasks   If PE1 has completed operating on a reference block  NI receives the block and inserts header information t o that specifying direction of movement number of hops i n the specified direction and size of the data forming a  message through packetization unit NI first generates a r equest signal 1 bit and sends it to the NoC router When  acknowledgment” is received by NI then it sends th e message to the router Each packet is formed of 4 pixel dat a \(32 bits and 32 bits is reserved for header packet   If PE1 is the destination node NI receives the mes sage from NoC router and extracts reference block from incomi ng message through its depacketization unit and sends this data to PE1   If the reference block required by PE1 is not resid ing in any another PE1, then NI generates the “data_load_contr ol” \(1 bit and “reference_block_id” \(5 bits\ signals through i ts “Control Unit” and feeds them to MI in order to request the data from Main Memory 4.2.3  NoC Router   If PE1 has completed operating on a reference block after the handshaking mechanism described earlier in NI secti on, NoC router receives the packetized message through 32 b it 5-1  input multiplexer  from NI The packets are then stored in ring buffer. A ring buffer is used instead of a FIFO as data can be accessed from it in only one clock cycle irr espective of buffer size. To accomplish this, we use two pointer s as shown in figure 3. The pointer first_index shows where the first data that comes in is stored Thus data pointed to by first_index should be the first data that comes out of buffer The pointer last_index shows where the last data that came in buffer is stored Thus the location where next data that come s in is stored is last_index  1  Suppose first packet is stored at location 1 and last packet is stored at location 5  The next packet that comes in after that will be stored at l ocation 0 and the next packet that goes out will be the packet at location 1 Buffer sends first packet of message to  header decoder   Header decoder  follows x-y routing protocol and extracts the direction of data transfer from header packet It also updates header packet with remaining “number of hop s in the direction of data transfer”. Based on the required direction of data transfer message is forwarded to an adjacent router through 32 bit 1-5 output de-multiplexer    When an adjacent router B has to send message to router A output controller of “B” first sends a request signal 1 bit to  input controller  of A If A is not busy communicating with any other routers, then input controller  of A checks available space in the buffer and sen ds an acknowledgement signal ack to output controller of  “B After receiving ack B starts sending message t o A through 32 bit 5-1 input multiplexer of “A”. The packets are then stored in  ring buffer  and forwarded to  header decoder where the following actions are taken   If the message has reached destination node it is sent to depacketization unit of NI through output  de-multiplexer    If the message has to be transferred to an adjacent  router C A is an intermediate hop  output  controller of “A” sends a request signal \(1 bit to input controller of “C”. After receiving “ack  Figure 2  Proposed architecture composed of 16 CP Es 4 PE2s and 1 PE3 CPEs receive data from main m emory through Memory Interface \(MI\ where MI computes memory addr ess of the reference blocks

In PE 2, muxes “s1” an d “s2” select the computation of either 4x8 or 8x4 motion vectors Demuxes s3 and s4 direct 4x8 or 8x4 SADs to their corre sponding comparators and registers After computing either 4 x8 or 8x4 SADs 8x8 SAD is generated which is sent to PE 3 to  process larger block SADs PE 3 is similar to PE 2 with dif ferences in granularity of adders. In PE 3, muxes “s1” and “s2 Figure 4 select computation of either 8x16 or 16x8 motion ve ctors Thereafter, demuxes “s3” and “s4” direct 8x16 or 16 x8 SADs to their corresponding comparators and registers Then  16x16 SAD is computed from either 8x16 or 16x8 SADs. Now we will discuss the routing patterns for different search a lgorithms 4.4  Fast Search Algorithms and Case Study Fast search algorithms like diamond, hexagon, big h exagon and spiral have been introduced to reduce the computati on complexity of motion estimation by operating on red uced number of reference blocks Number of reference blo cks for diamond and hexagon searches are shown in figures 6  and 11 Diamond search requires 9+5n+4 reference blocks  17  a n d  hexagon search requires 7+3n+4 18  r e f e r e n c e  b l o cks where  n is the number of execution iterations Diamond Search As shown in figure 6, pattern consists of nine candidate search points reference blocks in first  iteration Numbers in this figure represent the order of proce ssing the reference frames Directed edges are labeled with d ata transmission equations derived for diamond search p attern based on the data dependencies The grid co-ordinates fol lowed for data transfer is shown in fig 9. An equation is rep resented with nx\ and \(+/-ny\ where \(+ or -\ denotes the dire ction of data transfer on the x and y axis and n denotes the numb er of hops in that direction. Also, load indicates that reference block is loaded from the main memory We now explain SAD computation using diamond search  pattern for a 16 x 16 current block on the proposed architecture Figure 5 represents the current frame which is divi ded into blocks of size 4 x 4.  Sixteen 4x4 current blocks 5 3, 54, 55, 56 65 66 67 68 77 78 79 80 89 90 91 92 are loaded into CPE  \(1,1\, CPE  \(1,2\, CPE  \(1,3\, CPE  \(1,4\, CPE 2,1\, CPE 2,2 CPE  2,3 CPE  2,4 CPE  3,1 CPE  3 2 CPE 3,3\, CPE  \(3,4\, CPE  \(4,1\, CPE  \(4,2\, CPE  \(4 3\, CPE  \(4,4 respectively Each PE1 of the CPEs with a current b lock processes SAD on 9 reference blocks. PE1 \(1,1\ comp utes SAD for current block 53 against reference blocks 29 40’, 42’, 55 53’, 51’, 64’, 66’, 77 Figure 7 shows data dependencies and data transfer patterns for PE1\(1,1 and PE1\(1,3 Solid squares represent inte rsecting search points between the two and solid circles rep resent the other search points Table 1 shows the reference bl ock to be loaded in PE1s at different clock cycles. At clock cycle one, first search points \(reference blocks P 1 1 and P 3 1 are loaded into both processing elements from main memory through MI Fo r this NIs of CPE\(1,1 and CPE\(1,3 set  respective  data_load_control  signals to high indicating the CPE ids and “reference_block_id” output  to 1 indicating th e index of the search point on the diamond pattern \(figure 7\. Bas ed on these inputs and address of the current frames MI genera tes the addresses of the reference frames as per the search  pattern and outputs it to the main memory Main memory then se nds the requested data through corresponding “CPE” input po rts. In this case first reference blocks for PE1\(1,1 and PE1\(1 3 are 29 and 31’ respectively. Figure 7 shows that third sea rch point \(P 1 3  required by PE1\(1,1 is same as second search point  P 3 2  of PE1\(1,3 At clock cycle three P 3 2 is transmitted from PE1\(1,3\’s router to PE1\(1,1 The NI of PE1\(1,3 p acketizes the reference block according to data transmission equation Figure 6 Equation 1x+1y arrow labeled from poi nt 1 to 2 and sends the packets to the router The router of PE1\(1,2 receives the packets, decodes the header packet and following xy routing scheme forwards the packets to the route r of PE1\(1,1 PE1\(1,1 is the destination node hence it s NI depacketizes the data to be processed within its PE 1 Same events take place at cycles 5, 6 and 8 as shown in Figure 8.  The events illustrated with Figure 8 take place for all  sixteen 4x4 current blocks. The above data transfer pattern als o dictates that at every clock cycle, every CPE is accessing a uniq ue reference block. So, at no time slot, two CPEs compete for th e same data and there is no case of resource conflict For every successive iteration, nine SADs are compu ted in each PE1 If the computed SAD minima is located at one o f the vertices  1,4,6 and 9 or edges 2,3,7,8  of the  diamond Figure 6\ , a new diamond pattern is formed with t he minima as the new center for the next iteration This again r equires computation of SADs for next nine reference frames in the same order as in figure 7. But in this case, minima at t he vertex leads to only 5 new reference frames and the minima at th e edges lead to only 3 new reference frames for one iteration I n the last iteration, the minima is the center point \(5\. In t hat case, a small diamond is formed around the minima with 4 referenc e frames The order of reference frames for loading the data for this case and the data transmission equations are shown in fi gure 10. Data transmission equations for hexagon big hexagon and  spiral search patterns are shown in figure 11. The spiral search is more compute-intensive compared to other fast search pat terns The width of the spiral search determines the number of  reference frames to be compared In this example we carry ou t a 5x5 spiral search as shown in figure 11\(c So the num ber of reference frames is 25 Full Search Now we illustrate the functionality of the proposed architecture for full search. Table 2 show s data load schedule  for PE1\(1,1 As shown in table 2\(a at cycle on e four pixels of 4x4 current block are loaded into CP R registers 1 2, 3, 4 through current_data_\(1,1\ port. At cycle t wo, these four pixels are shifted to CPR registers 5, 6, 7, 8 and next four pixels are loaded into CPR registers 1 2 3 4 This cont inues for 4 cycles till a 4x4 current block is completely loade d into PE 1\(1,1\ as shown in table 2\(b\. Similarly, a 4x4 ref erence block is loaded into RPR registers of PE 1\(1,1 in four cycl es through reference_data_\(1,1 port All the PE1s are loaded with corresponding current and reference blocks in a sim ilar fashion At the end of the fifth clock cycle, 4x4 SADs are c omputed and sent to PE 2\(1 Table 3 Control signals to PE 2 1 select between computation of 4x8 SAD or 8x4 SAD at the en d of sixth cycle. At the end of seventh cycle, 8x8 SAD i s computed Similarly, four 8x8 SADs are then sent to PE 3. In PE 3, control signals select between computation of 8x16 SAD or 1 6x8 SAD 


                                         at the end of eighth cycle. At the end of ninth cyc le, 16x16 SAD  is computed \(Table 4\. Now, we present the performa nce results of our architecture and compare it with the ASIC ba sed approach [9   5  RESULTS Proposed architecture was designed with Verilog-HDL  description and synthesized by 90 nm CMOS standard cell library.

Rest of the computations in our architecture and [9  a r e  p i p e l i ned. Thus, [9  requires 265 cycles to produce a 16x16 motion vecto r for full search while our architecture requires 266 cycles Table 6 shows the minimum clock rate that is required to sustain 30fps and 60fps frame rates by the proposed architecture and its counterpart 9   A s  s h o w n  i n  t a b l e  6   f o r  Q C I F  f o r m at ASIC approach [9  n e e d s  t o  o p e r a t e  a t  0  7 6  M H z  t o  s u s t a i n the 30fps requirement, whereas our design needs a little fast er clock. This is because the number of cycles required to compute  16x16 motion vector is larger in our design 266 cycles  vs 9  2 6 5  cycles\.  For clock rates slower than 0.8 MHz, our design won’t be able to sustain 30fps  As shown in table 6 for  all frame sizes, our clock rate is comparable with [9   A s  e x pected, while the frame size gets larger the clock rate needs to  increase to respond to the more number of computations with the 30fps or 60 fps constraint Fewer number of search points for fast search algor ithms overcomes the “router” cycles overhead and requires even lesser number of cycles than full search Router’s critica l path consumes 6 cycles. Total data transmission cycles a re the sum of router cycles and total number of hops. Since avera ge number of hops for fast search patterns is 2, the routing cyc le’s overhead is 8 cycles per search point. Also, worst case number of reference blocks accounts from n=4 and best case comes from n 0 on a 32x32 search region. So, the best case and worst ca se number of search points are 13 and 33 for diamond search Inc luding the Table 2 \(a\ Data load schedule for PE1 Table 2 \(b\ Data load schedule for PE1 Table 3 Data flow for calculation of 8x8 SAD Table 4 Data flow for calculation of 16x16 SAD 0ÿišhù/ý8Ž» Ú×\`þÄ :3èàÍ£(èÜÞ¡k9\×•.h_ zû4Cß÷aþÍ0Ïs z ÀÀûý¾€!ÃëõŠÜB gMÓPÀ0Ãf K„PŠë#Â2À$ãn·+‹`ð²\.pŠ_.Çqz½ž Î2¨Ç*Ä€	B@Œ˜Ïçív[Ð@UU0ðB Øäd€Ó1‘VNÐ0   V«#‘Æ-Ž@G*•"ÜŽ˜ÍfX  K 82˜N§™L†-(‹&Ès¹#€'.¬çyQF£d2 VõÞ[kA’ÆÊEN    K  L€³¦iZ×5ß÷5†º®Ñ†!*žbÑ>Ã¾ï¯×+MSáôëº`€,ËŽãèºÎ¶m Figure 12.

routing overhead diamond search takes 104 cycles a nd 264 cycles for best case and worst case scenarios respe ctively which is less than 266 cycles of full search Similarly the worst case and best case number of search points are 23 and 11  for hexagonal search and thus it takes 184 and 88 cycle s respectively to produce a 16x16 motion vector. The worst case and best case number of search points are 33 and 21  for big hexagonal search and thus it takes 264 and 168 cycl es respectively to produce a 16x16 motion vector Also  the number of search points is constant for all the cas es of a spiral search For a 5x5 spiral search Figure 11\(c the  number of search points is 25 and thus it takes 200 cycles to  produce a 16x16 motion vector  Therefore architecture suppo rts fast search algorithms with operational frequencies less than the full search algorithm table 6 as shown in Table 7 For  QCIF format our architecture operates at 0.8MHz for ful l search Whereas as shown in Table 7 for DS HS BHS and S S it operates at 0.78 0.55 0.78 0.59 MHz correspondin gly for worst case scenarios. Since the number of search po ints for fast search types decrease significantly our architectu re can now operate at a slower clock rate even for the worst c ase scenarios to sustain the 30fps Further this pattern is obse rvable for all frame sizes Thus, the clock rate of the proposed architecture i s comparable to ASIC implementation for both full search and fas t search algorithms with much lesser resources. Therefore, t he frame size and frame rate supported by the circuit can be subs tantially extended subject to this clock rate constraint for high definition 6  CONCLUSION This paper proposed a new application specific reco nfigurable hybrid coarse-grained architecture with intelligent NoC scheme Existing coarse-grained architectures have generic processing elements and routing structure and therefore suffer  in performance and resource utilization for motion est imation algorithm as compared to our architecture. The inte lligent NoC scheme in our architecture supports VBSME for diffe rent types of fast search patterns like diamond search hexago nal search etc Hybrid grained processing elements support var iable block sizes in motion estimation. Simplicity and highly p arallel nature of the architecture with an excellent degree of dat a reuse makes our design suitable for run time reconfiguration A rchitecture can easily be configured to run any fast search or full search algorithm with block size variations to respond to the video quality and/or timing constraints Our 2D architect ure supports huge reuse of search data between processing elemen ts and thus reduces the memory transaction requirement which is missing in existing state of the art approaches Proposed arch itecture uses hybrid grained processing elements to compute 4x8 o r 8x4 and 8x16 or 16x8 motion vectors dynamically depending o n the control signals supplied. Our architecture is highl y flexible as it supports any block size for any search type which i s a challenging problem from ASIC perspective 7  REFERENCES 1  T. Wiegand, G. J. Sullivan, G.

departments on average\ignificant differences were found regarding the age of the applications. The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\. This supports the proposition \(P3.1\ that more interdependent applications also incur higher IT \(operations and maintenance\ts  Impacts of diversity-related AA complexity   Regarding OS-related diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 5\howed no significant difference between the operations costs of more \(Md=93,890 n=105\d less diverse applications \(Md=131,540 n=27\09.5, z=-1.174, p=.24. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007. Hence, the proposition \(P3.4\at applications with a greater degree of overlap also exhibit higher IT costs is not supported  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 12

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
