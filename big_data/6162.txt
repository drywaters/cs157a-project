This limits the power available for radio communications which constrains the downlink budget The limited transmit power translates to low downlink data rates on small satellites Antenna gain from directive antennas may be a power ef\002cient way of improving the downlink budget thereby increasing the downlink rate of small satellites We have developed a prototype low-power electrically-steered S-band phased array RF front-end suitable for a CubeSat that could ef\002ciently increase the EIRP permitting higher data rates A prototype of the array has been constructed and tested in an anechoic chamber The four element array provides a minimum gain of 2.5 dB and average gain of 5 dB compared to a single patch antenna element with a 5 W power envelope across a range of up to 60 degrees from broadside of the array Given the 100 mW overhead of each phased array element the design is expected to scale to a 16 element array which could 002t on two 20 cm by 10 cm deployable panels on a 2U CubeSat With a 10 watt average power budget for the transmitter such an array would provide an estimated gain of 11 dB compared to a single omnidirectional antenna T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1 I NTRODUCTION

budget is a bottleneck to communications on nanosatellites such as CubeSats Transmit signal power from many CubeSats is constrained by the limited surface area for solar panels and antenna gain is limited by use of omnidirectional antennas Additionally CubeSats are frequently constructed and operated by universities without access to large high gain dishes capable of tracking LEO satellites While off-the-shelf commercial radios designed for CubeSats are available supporting data rates in excess of 1 Mbps only a minority of CubeSats achieve these speeds 2 4 5 Transmitting at high data rates is possible but it is dif\002cult to achieve a suf\002cient signal-to-noise ratio to successfully decode these transmissions  978-1-4799-1622-1/14 31  00 c 015 2014 IEEE 1 IEEEAC Paper 2140 Version 11 Updated 12/30/2013 One approach to improving the link budget of CubeSats could be to increase the satellite's antenna gain Adding antenna gain using directional antennas reduces the transmitted power required to maintain a link budget However directional antennas must be pointed at a ground station to be effective Antennas could be steered mechanically by moving the array or reorienting the satellite or electrically with phased arrays Electrical steering using phased arrays is potentially more power ef\002cient than mechanical steering and may be preferred if reorienting the satellite would con\003ict with other systems such as cameras or solar panels or if the satellite lacks precise attitude control Phased arrays have the potential to increase the power ef\002ciency of link budgets compared to omnidirectional antennas provided that the DC power consumed by controlling the array is not greater than the decrease in transmitted power made possible by antenna gain A more ef\002cient downlink could increase the downlink rate and return more data on each pass or leave more power for the satellite payload However nearly all CubeSats use single patch antennas for microwave downlinks and information about phased arrays for CubeSats is sparse A University of Hawaii Mea Huaka`i CubeSat included a 5.8-GHz phased array however its launch vehicle failed and it was not tested in orbit The Uni v ersity of Hawaii has also designed compact retrodirective array prototypes however their design consumed too much power to be feasible to implement on CubeSats Lockheed Martin mentions the Phased Array Tile Rapid In-Orbit Test 050PATRIOT\051 CubeSat concept in marketing literature however they do not publicly mention if the proposed satellite was constructed This paper presents a prototype hardware design for a CubeSat-scale phased array and analyzes the performance of the array from the perspective of increasing the link budget with 002xed power consumption This paper focuses on design requirements for a phased array the RF hardware design array calibration and performance validation 2 P HASED A RRAY C ONCEPT AND H ARDWARE D ESIGN The goal of the phased array is to maximize equivalent isotropically radiated power 050EIRP\051 with a 002xed power budget Each element in the phased array adds overhead which diminishes the marginal return to the link budget of adding elements to the array A maximum useful range of array sizes exists as a function of the ef\002ciency of the array elements The EIRP at the mainlobe of an N element array with isotropic antennas and 025  2 antenna spacing can be modeled as EIRP  021 amp 050 P tot 000 N P elem 051 N 0501\051 1 


where P tot is the total power budget for the array P elem is the per element overhead and 021 amp is the transmit ampli\002er power added ef\002ciency The P elem per-element overhead factor describes the DC power used by T/R modules that is not consumed by the transmit power ampli\002er Figure 1 illustrates Equation 1 for 021 amp  25 and P elem  100 mW Figure 1  EIRP versus size of phased array for power budgets of 5 W 10 W and 20 W Note that with P tot equal to 5 W the EIRP of the array in Figure 1 does not bene\002t from adding more than 25 channels to the phased array This simple model does not take into account element spacing losses from mutual coupling losses due to imperfect beamforming or the radiation pattern of the antenna elements A multiplier 021 array could be added to account for losses due to mutual coupling and imperfect phasing Modeling the directivity of planar arrays with variable element spacing and antenna radiation patterns is developed in several papers and books 9 Adding the gain of an array G array 050 022 036 051  which can be calculated as a function of the individual element radiation pattern and the element-to-element spacing the EIRP of the phased array could be modeled with the following equation EIRP  021 amp G array 050 022 036 051\050 P tot 000 N P elem 051 021 array 0502\051 This equation can be used to evaluate con\002gurations of the prototype CubeSat phased array design A two element by eight element array using patch antennas described later in the paper with  42 025 spacing is expected to increase antenna gain by 12 dB relative to a single element at broadside This increase in antenna gain from the array is calculated numerically from a measured radiation pattern of a single T/R module from the array Using P tot  10 W 021 amp  25 Garray  12 dB and P elem  100 mW a 16 element S-band array is predicted by Equation 2 to provide 11.3 dB increase in EIRP over a single antenna element after accounting for DC power consumption of the array Measured error in the phase shifters results in a 021 amp of 0.3 dB Combining the 7 dB loss from the 1.6 W array overhead with 3 dB loss Table 1  2U Phased Array Size with Frequency using  42 025 Element Spacing and Patch Antennas   Frequency  025  Elements     144 MHz  200 cm  0   440 MHz  70 cm  0   900 MHz  33 cm  0   1.2 GHz  25 cm  2   2.48 GHz  12 cm  8   5.8 GHz  5.2 cm  36   10.1 GHz  2.9 cm  128   from phase shifter errors a 16 element array is expected to result in a 11 dB gain relative to a single antenna element at broadside with a 10 W power budget Not all frequencies and array topologies work well with nanosatellites The surface area on CubeSats limits which transmit frequencies are feasible Phased arrays require element-to-element spacing at some moderate fraction of a wavelength This means the UHF and VHF frequencies commonly used by CubeSats will not work without long deployable elements Table 1 shows a comparison of possible patch antenna phased array sizes at possible CubeSat downlink frequencies with a 2U 05020 cm by 10 cm\051 panel and 42 025 spacing The 2.4 GHz band was selected for the prototype phased array as the lowest practical frequency where it is possible to 002t multiple elements on a 1U face with azimuth/elevation steering It was chosen over the 5.8 GHz and 10 GHz bands because of availability of off-the-shelf MMIC components The low power budgets on CubeSats constrains possible phased array designs Some phased array topologies are not power ef\002cient enough to provide an improvement to the downlink budget The overhead from power hungry phase shifting techniques 050such as I/Q modulation of each channel with a DDS and mixers\051 consume the bene\002ts of increased antenna gain Placing a MMIC phase shifter before a power ampli\002er was determined to be the most ef\002cient con\002guration This topology uses negligible power to create a phase shift and minimizes losses to the signal at high power levels The phased array prototype works as an RF front end it needs a radio transceiver to synthesize an RF signal and to process received signals from the T/R modules The array divides the transmitted signal into multiple channels and then phase shifts and ampli\002es each channel individually See Figure 2 for a block diagram of the phased array design The hardware design of the phased array focused on the T/R modules control bus and feed network The receive path is provided for future development of a retrodirective antenna and is not discussed in this paper T/R Module The T/R modules provide a phase shift and ampli\002cation of the transmitted signal and ampli\002cation of the received signal Four T/R modules were designed and fabricated for the phased array See Figure 3 for a block diagram of the T/R modules and Figures 4 and 5 for photographs of a module prototype 2

Figure 6  Measured axial ratio versus frequency of the Taoglas WLP.2450.25.4.A.02 with azimuth offset Direction 002nding algorithms could aid in steering the array by determining the location of the ground station transmitting a beacon tone by processing simultaneous samples from the array If beamforming or switching between channels is not necessary the receive path from one channel could be connected to the radio receiver and the remaining channels could be disabled or depopulated The Skyworks 67014 LNA is switched off to reduce power consumption when the module is not in receive mode The T/R modules integrate a patch antenna on the reverse side as seen in Figure 4 Circularly polarized antennas were used to minimize polarization loss as CubeSats may not have control of their orientation relative to a ground station The Taoglas WLP.2450.25.4.A.02 right-hand circularly polarized 050RHCP\051 ceramic patch is used in the current prototype This antenna is only circularly polarized over a narrow bandwidth As shown in Figure 6 the measured bandwidth of the patch with an axial ratio below 3 dB is approximately 0.3 up to a 60 degree azimuth offset The antenna may need redesign after a speci\002c frequency has been allocated for a satellite mission See Table 2 for an overview of the performance of the T/R modules Feed Network A feed network is necessary to distribute the transmitted signal to phased array modules Variations in the phase and gain between different paths in the feed network are compensated for by the phase shifter and attenuator using lookup tables to determine the settings for each channel so the feed network does not need equal path lengths to each element The ZA4PD-4 4-way 0-degree power splitter from Mini-Circuits is used in the current prototype A smaller feed network could be constructed to 002t the mechanical requirements of a speci\002c satellite with microstrip circuits or surface mount power splitters Table 2  Phased Array T/R Module Speci\002cations   Parameter  Min  Max     Phase Shift Range  0 016  360 016   Gain 050TX Path\051  4 dB  24 dB   Gain 050RX Path\051  9 dB  11 dB   Phase Error   4  5 016 RMS   Amplitude Error   0.3 dB RMS   PAE at 24 dBm  25    Standby Mode Power   55 mW   Receive Mode Power   85 mW   Transmit Mode Power   1800 mW   Element Power Overhead   100 mW   Frequency  2400 MHz  2500 MHz   Calibration Ideally no phase variation would exist between phased array channels other than differences programmed by the phased array controller for beamforming Likewise in the absence of weighting there would ideally be no variation in amplitude between channels in the array In reality there are unintended amplitude and phase offsets between channels in the array from several sources These phase and amplitude variations must be measured to calibrate the array and evaluate its performance There are several sources of phase error within the array The largest contributors are path length differences in the feed network attenuation dependent phase shifts and differences in the power ampli\002er matching network between T/R module revisions The electrical length from the power splitter to the T/R modules is not equal in the current prototype as longer cables were needed to reach some elements This introduces a frequency dependent phase shift to those channels which would create an elevation angle offset to the beam if left uncompensated Amplitude also varies between channels up to 3.5 dB in amplitude variation is expected from the gain of the power ampli\002er and insertion losses of the phase shifter attenuator and T/R switch To compensate for differences the amplitude and phase response of the T/R modules is measured on a network analyzer The calibration plane of these measurements extends to the input of the feed network at one port and an RF connector near the antenna for the other port This measures differences in path length of the feed network as well as amplitude and phase variations in the T/R modules The Sparameters of the transmit paths were measured and recorded on a computer at all 64 phase shifter states and the 002rst 20 variable attenuator states using a script Data from these measurements are used to generate calibration lookup tables Calibration measurements are currently taken at an uncontrolled room temperature and the array has not yet been tested in a temperature controlled chamber Additional calibration tables across temperature variations may be required Phase and amplitude variations are corrected with calibration tables To generate calibration tables at a single frequency the lowest error combination of phase shifter and attenuator states is computed for a 002xed amplitude and 180 phase steps The output amplitude for the T/R modules is selected to balance ampli\002er ef\002ciency and signal distortion 4 


Figure 7  Measured phase and amplitude error through each of the four T/R modules 050labeled e f g and h\051 following calibration First the lowest error phase shifter state is calculated for each phase step Then the lowest error attenuation setting to set the power at the antenna port to a predetermined value is determined The phase shifter register settings are then recomputed to account for the variations in phase shift from the attenuation The 002nal phase shifter and attenuator register values for each phase offset step are stored in non-volatile memory on the phased array module Following calibration the phase and amplitude error of the T/R modules is measured This is done by stepping the modules through phase settings at a calibrated 002xed output power and comparing the measured phase shift with the desired phase setting The difference between the measured and intended phase shift is the phase error and the difference between the measured gain and expected gain is the gain error See Figure 7 for a plot of the measured phase and amplitude error through the four prototype T/R modules and feed network following calibration The highest RMS phase error following calibration is 4.5 degrees across all phase shift steps of the four prototype T/R modules This is comparable to the 3 degree RMS quantization error speci\002ed by the manufacturer of the phase shifter chip A 4.5 degree RMS phase error is calculated to degrade the output SNR of the phased array prototype by 3 dB The amplitude error following calibration is 29 dB RMS which is near the 26 dB quoted in the datasheet of the variable attenuator 3 T ESTING AND P ERFORMANCE V ALIDATION The functionality and performance of the phased array was validated in an anechoic chamber Vector network analyzer 050VNA\051 S 21 measurements representing the path loss through the anechoic chamber are used to measure the relative gain of the array These measurements are taken with the VNA calibration plane extending to the input of the feed network at one port and the connector of the receiving antenna at the other port The antenna gain of the phased array is computed from these measurements by comparing the S 21 measurements from a single antenna to the S 21 measurements of the array at varying electrical steering and azimuth and elevation orientations The radiation pattern is measured by mounting the array to a platform with adjustable azimuth and elevation angle This platform was constructed with servo gearboxes and plastic components fabricated with a 3D printer See Figure 8 for a picture of the phased array showing the feed network control bus and the elevation servo See Figure 9 for a picture of the front of the four element phased array prototype in an anechoic chamber Figure 8  Photograph back side of the phased array inside an anechoic chamber Figure 9  Photograph of the phased array prototype mounted on a tripod inside an anechoic chamber 5 


The effectiveness of the phased array is determined by calculating the gain of the transmitting phased array compared to a single element with a receiving RHCP antenna Polarization of the signal is measured by transmitting into a rotating linearly polarized antenna The axial ratio and received signal power is calculated by 002tting an ellipse to j S 21 j measurements taken while rotating the linearly polarized receive antenna Polarization mismatch loss to a circularly polarized antenna is then calculated from these measurements with the following equation where 015 e is the measured axial ratio 021 mismatch  10log 10 050 1  2  015 e  1  015 2 e 051 0503\051 The gain from the phased array is calculated by comparing path loss measurements across an anechoic chamber of a single T/R module with an array of T/R modules The phased array T/R modules are calibrated to a 002xed output power level Therefore quadrupling the number of transmitting modules increases the EIRP of the phased array by 6 dB independent of the antenna gain Additionally a fraction of the phased array power budget is the DC power overhead from the array The phased array path loss measurements are compensated to account for the overhead of the phased array modules and the increased transmit power from multiple active elements This can be calculated as a function of the element power P elem  the total power P tot  and the number of elements N  The following equation describes the correction to path loss applied to anechoic chamber array measurements to compare them with individual element measurements for N elements a total power budget of P tot  and an element overhead of P elem  001P loss  10log 10 050N\051 000 10log 10 050 P tot 000 NP elem  P tot 051 0504\051 For the 4 element phased array prototype with a 5 watt power budget and a 100 mW per-element overhead an additional 6.4 dB of path loss is added to the array measurements when comparing them to the individual element path loss measurements The calculated gain from the phased array is the difference in magnitude between the path loss through the anechoic chamber of a single element and the compensated path loss of the array electrically steered to point at the receiving antenna Test Results Measurements show the four element phased array in a two element by two element planar con\002guration increases antenna gain compared to a single patch antenna element The radiation pattern of the phased array was compared to an expected radiation pattern calculated from measurements of an individual T/R module The expected radiation pattern eliminates the effects of phase quantization and mutual coupling If the measured and expected radiation patterns closely match it would indicate that mutual coupling and quantization effects are minimal Phase shifts for the expected radiation pattern are applied in software to remove any phase quantization effects Other T/R modules were disconnected and detached from the array when measuring the individual element radiation pattern to eliminate mutual coupling Figure 10 shows the array electrically steered to 30 degrees on the azimuth axis and 30 degrees on the elevation Figure 10  Measured and calculated radiation pattern of array with 30 degree azimuth and elevation angle steering Figure 11  Radiation pattern of array and a single element with a 5 W power budget axis compared to a calculated array pattern with the same electrical steering At a 30 degree azimuth and elevation angle mechanical orientation the measured and calculated path losses agree to within 5 dB As expected the main lobe of the phased array radiation pattern is centered near the 30 degree azimuth and elevation angle orientation The difference in the path loss through an anecohic chamber between the phased array and a single element is used to evaluate the performance of the array Figure 11 shows slices of the radiation pattern of a single antenna element compared to the phased array with the array steered broadside and with a 30 degrees azimuth and elevation offset across azimuth and elevation angle mechanical orientations The radiation patterns from the array are compensated for polarization loss and a 100 mW per element overhead with a 5 W power budget using equations 3 and 4 6 


Figure 11 illustrates antenna gain from using the phased array steered broadside and steered with a 30 degrees azimuth and elevation offset When the array is steered broadside and oriented with no azimuth or elevation angle offsets relative to the receive antenna the calculated path loss including array overhead is 3.2 dB lower than the path loss for an individual element with a 5 W power budget Likewise when the array is mechanically oriented with a 30 degree azimuth and 30 degree elevation angle offset the radiation pattern from the array steered to compensate for the orientation has 5.5 dB lower path loss than an individual element Figure 12 computes this gain across azimuth orientations from 60 degrees to 60 degrees and elevation angle offsets of up to 60 degrees See Figure 12 for the calculated array gain relative to a single antenna with the same power budget at 2.485 GHz with a simulated 002xed power budget of 5 W The array gain at broadside and one offset illustrated in Figure 11 are marked in Figure 12 with orange dots The antenna gain measurements are calculated by comparing path loss of single antenna measurements with the path loss of the four element array electrically steered to compensate for mechanical orientation and adjusted for array overhead using Equation 4 This 002gure illustrates the bene\002t to EIRP from using the four element phased array on a satellite with a 002xed power budget across azimuth and elevation orientations of the array The array provides an average of 5 dB gain compared to a single element with a minimum of 2.5 dB at 60 degrees azimuth and 10 degrees elevation angle orientation The degraded performance at high azimuth offsets from broadside could be caused by imperfections in the radiation patterns of the elements The gain at some extreme azimuth and elevation steerings exceeds 6 dB which is the highest expected value from the four element array This is possibly the result of variation between the radiation patterns of individual elements in the array 4 C ONCLUSION This paper presented the design of a four element prototype phased array suitable for CubeSat-scale satellites The array maintains a minimum of 2.5 dB and average of 5 dB in EIRP gain compared to a single omnidirectional element up to 60 degrees from broadside with a 5 W power budget at 2.485 GHz In the average case with a 100 mW per element overhead and 25 PAE ampli\002ers the 4 element phased array consuming only 2 W could match the EIRP of a single antenna system consuming 5 W The prototype T/R modules could scale to 16 elements on a pair of 2U panels with a 10 W power budget Such an array is expected to provide a 11 dB increase in EIRP compared to a system with a single patch antenna and the same power budget despite 1.6 W of DC power overhead from the phased array Phased arrays have the potential to increase the ef\002ciency of CubeSat downlink communication at the expense of mechanical and electrical complexity The current prototype is limited to the electronics mechanical design has been considered only brie\003y Future work could include integrating the prototype with a nanosatellite design with an appropriate feed network and cable routing for the control bus Thermal and vacuum testing of the modules to investigate the robustness of the electronics and array calibration is also needed A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The research was carried out at the University of Alaska Fairbanks College of Engineering and Mines funded in part by the Alaska Space Grant Program R EFERENCES   Tethers Unlimited 223SWIFT Software De\002ned Radios\224 http://www.tethers.com/SpecSheets Brochure  SWIFT  SDR.pdf   Inno\003ight 223Flight-Heritage S-Band CubeSat Radio\224 http://inno\003ight.com/s-band  cubesat  radio   Iwami R.T Bao Jun Lei Lim T Tonaki W.G Chun T.F Zamora A Longhi J.C Watanabe M.K Akagi J.M Shiroma W.A 223Miniaturization challenges for autonomously phased arrays in a CubeSat application,\224 Wireless Information Technology and Systems 050ICWITS\051 2010 IEEE International Conference on  vol no pp.1,4 Aug 28 2010-Sept 3 2010   B Klofas 223A Survey of CubeSat Communication Systems 2009-2012,\224 in CubeSat Developers Workshop April 2013   B Klofas 223A Survey of CubeSat Communication Systems,\224 in CubeSat Developers Conference April 2009   King B 223Lockheed Martin CubeSats Studies\224 http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed data space/documents/tradeshows/smallsat2012 2012%20CubeSat%20Fact%20Sheet  Rev4.pdf   A W Rudge K Milne A D Olver P Knight 223The Handbook of Antenna Design Volume 2\224 1983   Godara L 223The effect of phase-shifter errors on the performance of an antenna-array beamformer,\224 Oceanic Engineering IEEE Journal of  vol.10 no.3 pp.278,284 Jul 1985   Forman B 223Directivity characteristics of scannable planar arrays,\224 Antennas and Propagation IEEE Transactions on  vol.20 no.3 pp.245,252 May 1972   Benhring Pike 223Air Force Test Range Technical Report AF WTR-TR-65-1\224 1965 7

Several previous works propose to improve the efìciency of Xenês Credit CPU scheduler For example proposes a modiìcation to the scheduler that asynchronously assigns each virtual CPU to a physical CPU in order to reduce CPU sleep time Lin et al de v eloped that schedules batch workloads within interactive VMs without compromising the usability of interactive applications The drawback of this system is that it was not designed to run on a cluster Xi et al use techniques from Real-Time scheduling to give stricter deadline guarantees to each virtual machine Other work has looked at avoiding interference between these tasks by careful VM placement 23 or dedicating resources P aragon 7 proposes a heterogeneous and interference-aware data center scheduler The system prefers to assign the applications on the heterogeneous hardware platform that the application can beneìt from and have less interference with the co-scheduled applications MIMP extends our preliminary study to reduce interference through minor changes to Xenês scheduler and then uses the residual resources for big data applications To improve I/O performance Xu et al propose the use of cores that have a much smaller time-slice compared to normal cores reducing the overall IRQ processing latency Cheng et al impro v es I/O performance for Symmetric MultiProcessing VMs by dynamically migrating the interrupts from a preempted VCPU to a running VCPU thereby avoiding interrupt processing delays Our current focus is on shared environments where disk I/O is not the bottleneck for interactive applications but view this as important future work Job scheduling in MapReduce environments has focused on topics like fairness 24 and dynamic cluster sharing among users Bu et al 1 propose a ne w hadoop scheduler based on the existing fair scheduler They present an interference and locality-aware task scheduler for MapReduce in virtual clusters and design a task performance prediction model for an interference-aware policy Morton et al provide a time-based progress indicator for a series of Map Reduce jobs which can be used to predict job completion times Polo et al provide a system to dynamically adjust the number of slots provided for map reduce jobs on each host to maximize the resource utilization of a cluster and to meet the deadline of the jobs 19 decides the appropriate number of slots allocated to map and reduce based on the upper and lower bounds of batch workload completion time obtained from the history of job proìling Our work is distinct from prior work in that we estimate the job completion time of the batch jobs that are running in clusters with unpredictable resource availability due to other foreground applications Previous works 9 12 14 ha v e sho wn heterogeneous cluster designs wherein a core set of dedicated nodes running batch jobs are complemented by residual resources from volunteer nodes or in some cases using spot instances from EC2 The closest w ork to ours is by Clay et al The y present a system that determines the appropriate cluster-size to harness the residual resources

 11    Figure 7: Cost estimated per subsystem \(bar chart on top\of one spacecraft  Small Satellite Cost Model \(SSCM\ based on inputs for a candidate nano-satellite mission \(bottom excel spreadsheet   The SSCM model was then used to calculate the total cost of developing and manufacturing only the first small satellite of mass 10 kg and other specifications listed  Figure 7 The cost calculated for every subsystem and the total cost of $15.08 million in FY 2010 is therefore a function of technological variables like power and pointing and not just mass  To check the sensitivity of technology used to cost we varied some of the input parameters and checked its effect on cost in FY97 $million. Changing the data rate from 10 kbps to 10 MBps to 1 GBps resulted in a cost of $11.35 11.4 and 11.45 million respectively Since COTS products will be used to support the communication link these cost estimates imply that there will be only a 100,000 difference in deploying a radio transmitter 10 kbps\ or deploying an optical transmitter \(1 GBps\ on the 10 kg nano-satellite While previous proposals have certainly supported the availability for laser technologies 50   t h e o p tical d e m o n s tr ati o n s  t h at ar e c u r r en tl y  b ei n g  developed by DLR in Germany and the Aerospace Corporation in the US 51  clea r l y  d e m o n s tr ate  th a t t h e  cost of optical technology is more than that Similarly changing the pointing accuracy from 0.1 0.01 to 0.001 degrees resulted in the cost increasing from FY97 $ 6.45 11.33 and 22.21 million respectively The technology to support 0.1 degrees \(sun sensors\ is different from that to support 0.001 degrees star trackers However current COTS quotations \(e.g. Blue Canyon technologies XACT show that it costs 100,000 for a nanosat star tracker system Integration may cost a few additional thousands but estimating it to 18 million more sounds a bit too much  The SSCM sensitivity study above highlights the need to have cost models that are more sensitive to different technologies and their associated complexities Complexity and risk assessment has been proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the form of their COBRA model  We used the COBRA model in our next study where the methodology and data sets are detailed in \([39   40    5 2     T h e d ata s et r elati v e to  w h ic h  co m p le x ities  ar e  calculated included 120 DoD and NASA missions from after FY89 excluded launch delays or failures and projects with heavy international cooperation. Complexity drivers include  Table 4  column 1 subsystem technical parameters e.g mass power performance technology choices\ and programmatic factors \(e.g., heritage, level of redundancy, foreign partnership  Forty such parameters are considered that are either continuous e.g mass power and represent a range of values bounded by a minimum and maximum, or discrete such as propulsion type \(none, cold gas, monopropellant bipropellant or ion engine\ that represent a finite number of choices    For our smallsat case study, the factors corresponding to spacecraft complexity as they proposed are listed in Table 4 along with the minimum and maximum value that the component takes within their data set The column  candidate nano-satellite which will be a part of a DSM  different 3D angles from the same ground spot as it formation flies in LEO 53  5 4 55    Fo r  ea ch  f ac to r   the complexity of the nanosat is calculated as a percentage of where the data point corresponding to the nanosat lies with respect to the data points for all the other space missions considered. For discrete data, the discrete rank of the data is assessed and then converted into a percentage The average complexity of the proposed nanosat is calculated to be 21.64 


 12  Table 4: Cost estimated for a spacecraft as a function of the relative complexity of its components with respect to components used in previous missions  Based Risk Assessment \(COBRA\ model. Inputs \(Data in Column 3\ are from a candidate nanosatellite mission    The map between complexity percentile and required mission cost and development time for successful missions green triangles is shown in Figure 8  using a green trend line. The missions plotted are among the 120 studied missions and equations are mentioned within the  attempted cheaper than or faster than this model predicts then there is a large probability of failure as highlighted by the red and yellow crosses on Figure 8  Using the above model the estimated cost for our candidate nanosatellite 10 kg mission is 35.824 million and the estimated development time is 35.074 months The high cost is in keeping with the intuition expressed in the data collection section that the cost of LEO small satellites are driven more by technology than mass so the utility of shrinking the satellite should be critically assessed and avoided if the mission technology is very state of art In such cases, micro satellites would win the performance to cost ratio battle    Figure 8: Predicted mission cost and development time as a function of relative mission complexity with respect to other missions evaluated by the Aerospace Corporation [39    4 0     5 2    M is s io n c o m ple x it y  is  a  function of component complexities as calculated in Table 4 The candidate mission is a LEO satellite measuring passive Earth reflectance as part of a DSM  We ran a sensitivity analysis for the COBRA model by varying the deltaV and pointing accuracy required by the candidate satellite It does a great job in predicting the increase in costs from 1 degree to 0.01 or 0.1 degree, by 


 13  estimating a $ 200-250 increase. It overshoots the COTS quotations by a slight margin but is certainly better than the SSCM estimate of  18 million more When the required delta-V is increased from none to 40 m/s to 80 m/s to 120 m/s the respective costs are estimated to be FY97 $ 35.79, 35.82, 35.85 and 35.88 million. Quotations from a 3D cold gas propulsion system printing company called AustinSat revealed that their 1U propulsion unit capable of providing 40 m/s of delta V costs 100,000 with 6DOF thrusters included and would scale almost linearly as more 1U units are added for 40 m/s of more delta-V  The COTS systems therefore cost more than what the COBRA model predicts. The model can thus be improved and made more suitable for COTS-supported small satellites if COTS data and figures were included in the data set to calculate complexity. Since we do not have the data set only the published Figure 8  we could not make the changes  Since many small satellite missions are collaborations between many organizations, the COBRA model could be improved by adding a foreign partnership complexity factor that captures the number of collaborators not just the nationality For example a recent paper 56   formulated a data supported method of capturing international cooperation related complexity using cyclometric  complexity where CGF  0.917  0.0575*CyclometricNumber and CyclometricNumber  f\(nodes, edges, outputs    Figure 9: Cost growth required to support increasing TRL for any component as published in [57    Small satellites are always pushing the boundaries of technology. It is very probable that some of its component values will fall out of range available from past missions In such a case, cost models of TRL transition such as the one shown in Figure 9  57  s h o u ld  b e in co r p o r ated  in to  the COBRA model for the relevant factors Although TRL transition correlates to the spending it does not follow traditional 80-20 rule The COBRA model also does not capture the structural complexity of a small tightly packed satellite which has been theoretically shown to drive development costs. Structural complexity can be quantified using a simple framework shown in Figure 10 35  34   an d  ca n  b e ea s il y  i n tr o d u ce d  i n  t h e COBRA model via a new factor and recalculating the data fit  Capturing the above development costs is important for small satellites whose costs are driven more by technology than by mass. Again, since we do not have the data set \(only the published Figure 8 we could not make the changes   Figure 10 Structural complexity metric introduced and validated in [35  a nd   3 4    5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify three major problems with current cost and risk models that limit their direct application to estimating the costs of DSMs They are the absence of reliable learning curve factors small satellite 20 kg costing tools and operations costing  Existing models and methodologies that may be applicable in part to DSMs have been identified and presented using an extensive literature survey We select ed  some appropriate methods and applied them to estimate the cost of small satellites and small satellite DSMs The exercise helped us point out valuable insights and/or inconsistencies in the results with respect to the data We also suggest methods to modify the models so that they become more suitable for small satellite DSMs  As future work the operations cost model and dynamic complexity of the mission is expected to be captured by a Systems Dynamics Model Re sults from model simulations can provide insight into the effect of design and operation decisions on lifecycle cost and risk expected to improve upon the Monte Carlo results The model results can guide the trade-off of cost with performance and can help in the se lection of a final point design for any given DSM
