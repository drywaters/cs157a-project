exploration programs In particular cubeSats in formation have been proposed to operate in the vicinity of the Lunar Lagrangian L1 to collect lunar scienti\002c data and to perform surface observation In this paper we present a low complexity CDMA system for CubeSats 050M small spacecraft\051 for communications between the Lunar L1 and Earth station It is well known that the complexity of a CDMA transmitter is much lower than the complexity of the CDMA receiver Moreover the complexity of a channel encoder is always much lower than the complexity of the channel decoder So for downlink communications it makes sense to use encoders for modern codes such as Turbo and LDPC followed by a spread spectrum transmitter for CDMA systems for CubeSats Here we used an LDPC coded CDMA with BPSK modulation with rectangular and half-sine pulse shaping Except for the PN generator seed numbers the communication structure of all CubeSats would be identical and operating at one single RF frequency For the uplink we may choose an uncoded CDMA system since the uplink transmit power is expected to be high enough to support the use of uncoded CDMA system In addition since there would be no multipath for the uplink 050broadcast channel\051 the use of orthogonal spreading codes such as Walsh codes is appropriate The choice of orthogonal codes would reduce the multiuser interference However due to some limitation 050bandwidth data rates and M\051 we may be forced to use nonorthogonal PN codes In addition one of the spreading codes will not carry any data which acts as an unmodulated pilot to reduce the complexity of synchronization The proposed uncoded CDMA yields receivers for CubeSats that have low complexity implementation Each component of CubeSats could easily extract its own received data with almost no interference from other users in case of orthogonal spreading codes For the downlink depending on the available bandwidth and the data rates a large processing gain could be obtained if the N is not large Thus the multiuser interference degradation due to the other CubeSats could be made small at the Earth station If N is large and the bandwidth and data rates do not allow large processing gains then the multiuser interference could be high In such cases we could use a simple parallel interference cancellation method with two stages that dramatically improves the system performance for the downlink In this paper we accurately analyzed and simulated the proposed CDMA system for a concept Constellation of 20 CubeSats 050M=20\051 All

constellation of CubeSats or small satellites to perform science in deep space Current communication capabilities 050hardware and software\051 for CubeSats have allowed small satellites to relay data and telemetry for missions at LEO Ho we v er  cooperative communication across small platforms and interplanetary communication are still challenging due to the limited size and power of these spacecraft Hence to allow CubeSats and small satellites to perform more ambitious missions farther from LEO new approaches need to be developed The approach proposed in this paper would support a constellation of CubeSats located at the Lunar Lagrangian Point 1 050LL1\051 to perform radio aperture interferometry at very low frequencies 05030 KHz to 3 MHz\051 The constellation concept is named SOLARA/SARA 050Solar Observing Lo wfrequency Array for Radio Astronomy/Separated Antennas Recon\002gurable Array\051 and it would be composed of 20 6Unit 050U\051 spacecraft arranged in a rough 10-100 km sphere at the 002rst Earth-Moon Lagrange point The CubeSats would collect data using dipoles and a distributed correlater for aperture synthesis imaging The proposed array of CubeSats would improve our knowledge of heliophysics and space weather it would contribute to the identi\002cation of extrasolar planets and it would add to our knowledge of the interior structure and dynamo mechanics of the outer planets by pinpointing the source of radio bursts SARA is the name of the proposed SOLARA communications system SARA would transmit data to Earth by applying a set of cooperative communication strategies some of them described in this paper The proposed constellation of CubeSats would be located at the Lunar Lagrangian Point 1 The LL1 point lies on the line between the Earth and the Moon and it is of particular importance since it would allow the constellation to be at a suf\002cient distance from Earth to reduce man-made radio frequency contamination 050RFI\051 while guaranteeing uninterrupted access to the sun continuous view of the Earth for communication and minimal station keeping In section 2 we provide the link Analysis in section 3 1 


we discuss Hardware implementation in section 4 Network Con\002gurations in section 5 Coverage and Doppler Analysis The goal is to demonstrate the CDMA system would be a viable solution for CubeSats communication system Section 6 describes the CDMA waveforms and Simulink models to obtain performance Section 7 provides a summary 2 L INK A NALYSIS The link analysis developed in this section was focused on identifying a feasible data rate for a constellation of CubeSats in LL1 The analysis focused on two links the satelliteground link and the satellite-satellite link The following sub sections detail analysis developed Satellite-Ground link The link analysis is performed by de\002ning a best and a worst case scenario for both downlink and uplink The worst and best case scenario are obtained by considering the worst and best values for each parameter involved in the analysis For example for path distance a range between 324,400 Km and 360,000 Km is considered The assumptions for the link analysis calculation are as follows 017 Downlink 1  Transmitter A generic CubeSat transmitter is considered The transmitter output power is assumed to be 1 W which is consistent with the current transceivers capabilities for CubeSat in S-Band 3 The antenna g ain is estimated to 0 dB with 2 dB of pointing loss and 1 dB of transmitter loss 050conservative estimates\051 2  Receiver It is assumed to use the DSN 34 m dish According to the recei ving g ai n is 56 dB and the system noise temperature is estimated at 46.54 K The pointing loss depends on the location of the CubeSats with respect to each other and the center of the constellation A preliminary calculation has been done considering 20 CubeSats placed in a circular pattern 050Figure 1\051 The DSN antenna would point at the center of the pattern The distance between the center of the constellation and each CubeSat changes depending on the inter-CubeSat distance which would range between 75 Km and 200 km The result of this analysis shows that the pointing loss would range between 0.4 dB 050inter-CubeSat distance of 75 km\051 and 3 dB 050inter-CubeSat distance of 200 km\051 based on 3  Central frequency The 2.3 GHZ NASA DSN S-Band frequency is assumed 4  Modulation BPSK 050Eb/N0=9.6 dB for a BER 10 000 5 051 5  Range between 324,400 and 360,000 as in 6  Atmospheric attenuation The atmospheric attenuation is very mild due to the frequency The attenuation values have been computed using 017 Uplink 1  Transmitter DSN 34 m dish is considered According to  the transmitter po wer ranges between 17 and 24 W  the gain is 55.2 dB waveguide loss range ranges between 0.5 and 0.7 dB and pointing losses are the same as discussed for the downlink 2  Receiver A generic CubeSat is considered for this analysis The receiving gain of the patch antenna is 0 dB the pointing error is 2 dB and the noise temperature is computed considering the worst case scenario Speci\002cally the antenna noise is computed as the sum of Earth noise 050290 K\051 and Figure 1  Location of the CubeSats in a circular pattern galactic noise 05050 K\051 and the receiver noise is approximated to the Earth noise 3  Central frequency The 2.02 GHz NASA DSN S-band frequency is assumed 4  Modulation same as downlink 5  Atmospheric attenuation same as downlink The result of the analysis is shown in Table 1 It is important to notice that in the worst case of the downlink a data rate of 6 kbps could be supported with a 3 dB margin Inter-satellite link For the inter-satellite link the following assumptions are considered 017 Downlink 1  Transmitter It is assumed to be the same CubeSat discussed in 2.1 050downlink\051 2  Receiver In this case the receiver would also be a CubeSat The receiving characteristics would be the same described in 2.1 050uplink\051 3  Central frequency The 2.3 GHZ NASA DSN S-Band frequency is assumed 4  Antenna noise temperature only the galactic noise 05050 K\051 is considered in this case 5  Receiver noise temperature A conservative estimate of 290K is assumed 6  Modulation BPSK 050Eb/N0=9.6 dB for a BER 10 000 5 051 7  Range between 75 Km and 200 Km as in 017 Uplink The assumptions are the same as in the downlink with the exception of the central frequency which is 2.02 GHz 1 The result of the analysis is shown in Table 2 It is possible to notice that a data rate of 15 kbps can be reached for downlink and uplink with a margin of 3 dB in the worst case scenario CDMA Case The system improves greatly by using the CDMA scheme In fact when CDMA is used the Eb/N0 required becomes only 1.8 dB with respect to the previous 9.6 dB As a consequence 2 


Table 1  Link analysis table for the satellite to ground link 050no coding\051 it is possible to transmit at a higher data rate 35 kbps for the satellite to ground link and 90 kbps for the satellite to satellite link Results are shown in Tables 3 and 4 3 H ARDWARE I MPLEMENTATION The objective of this section of the paper is to provide some information on how the proposed scheme could be implemented on board a CubeSat using existent CubeSat hardware One of the challenging aspects in developing a CubeSat mission is the schedule while traditional mission may take 10 years or more from the initial design to the development and the launch CubeSats are generally developed according to a much faster 0502-3 years\051 schedule especially in academia Hence when proposing to impleme nt ne w schemes on CubeSats it is important to be able to develop them by using or modifying existent hardware In our case the proposed scheme could be completely developed using existent CubeSats components with 003ight heritage Specifically the scheme could be implemented using an FPGA for the CDMA coding an S-Band transceiver 050preferably in Software De\002ned Radio to guarantee 003exibility\051 and an SBand antenna Table 5 would provide an example of 003ight quali\002ed hardware available for purchase which would satisfy the CubeSats requirements Table 2  Link analysis table for inter-satellite links 050no coding\051 4 N ETWORK C ONFIGURATIONS Different network con\002gurations could be considered for the proposed constellation of CubeSats depending on whether or not all the CubeSats would be equipped with the same communication system So far we have determined three con\002gurations to analyze 1  No Master Network In this con\002guration concept each CubeSat would be equipped with the exact same antenna and transceiver Each CubeSat would communicate autonomously with Earth This con\002guration would be the more resistant against failures since even if a single CubeSat fails all the others could continue their mission and transmit their data to the ground However the absence of a dedicated CubeSat for communication would limit the achievable data rate which is 6 kbps 050see link analysis\051 2  Single Master Network In this con\002guration concept all but one of the CubeSats would be equipped with a low gain antenna while one would be equipped with an high gain antenna This last CubeSat would be the master of the network and all the other CubeSats 050slaves\051 would relay their data to it The master would be responsible for establishing and maintaining a high data rate 050 100 kbps\051 link to Earth The advantage of this con\002guration is the possibility of establishing a high data rate at LL1 while still using CubeSats The disadvantage is that a single master would represent a single 3

that the users have purely random PN codes assigned to them This assumption is justi\002ed by the use of long PN codes with period much longer than the bit duration It is to be emphasized however that the proposed scheme to be discussed in what follows apply equally well to any appropriate set of PN codes chosen for the users provided that the codes are known to the receiver In view of our assumption over the zero-th coded symbol interval  the i-th users PN waveform can be expressed in the form c i 050 t 051  P 021 k 1 c i;k p c 050 t 000 kT c 051 where is again a unit power rectangular

error rate in the presence of M users namely 050 E s N o 051 M to that which would be required to achieve the same level of performance if only a single user was communicating namely 050 E s N o 051 1  By the de\002nition of 050 E s N o 051 1  we have P b 050 Error 051  F b 050 R 050 E s N o 051 1 051 where F b 050 RE s N o 051 represents the bit error rate of a rate R coded system In a CDMA system the other user interference 050multiuser interference\051 will degrade the performance Hence the 050 E s N o 051 1 is given by 050 E s N o 051 1  P T s  N o 050 M 000 1\051 P T c  050 E s N o 051 M

diagram data then is spreaded with a long PN code The spreaded sequence then is BPSK modulated The pulse shaping is done in the modulator At the Earth station receiver the observed samples would be de-spreaded Meanwhile the observed samples would also be provided to the PN search and PN tracking loops The carrier and timing synchronization would also be done in addition to match 002ltering The soft LogLikelihood-Ratio 050LLR\051 of de-spreaded signal samples after inserting zeros values in the puncturing positions would enter the iterative decoder which uses message passing belief propagation to decode the transmitted data Power spectral density of pulse-shaped PN sequence In order to meet the requirements of spectrum mask standard we have to shape PN pulses to satisfy the standard Here we consider National Telecommunications and Information Administration 050NTIA\051 standard to specify the downlink mask criteria For PN pulse shaping half-sine wave pulse shaping has been used that meets the NTIA requirement When PN signal uses half sine chip pulses we have c 050 t 051  P i c i p sin 050 t 000 iT c 051 where c i  1 or 1 are iid sequence and p sin 050 t 051  p

  Paper 2581 Version 2  14   Flight i nformation and processing   Presentation and projection of flight profiles   Real time operational information   Managing both pilot operator and air traffic controller workloads   Procedural processes supported by enhanced automation capabilities   Control sector complexity and management   Separation a ssurance   Airspace d esign and p rocedures   Investment in resolving these constraints  will drive the rate of adoption in civil UAS operations in the NAS One p art of the investment will be driven by the FAA\222s \223F acilities and Equipment\224 F&E Budget over  the next ten years Another part will be driven by defense and federal investment  in R&D  The remaining part will be driven by private investment seeking to develop profitable supplie r s and manufacturing firms of UAS Unfortunately   private investment will not fully launch until there is a clear indication of the public investment into implementing the requisite air traffic management  and air traffic control  ATM/ATC changes into the NAS infrastructure and there i s a common  approach through avionic standards in UA V  equipage   It is expected that avionic standards would lower the end user costs The impact on NAS infrastructure is the outline in the following subsection  Today\222s Air Traffic Control System  Today\222s air traffic control system is built around four basic pillars. These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
