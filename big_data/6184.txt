Firstly, this article has not considered the direct impact of team composition on the match outcome as it has varied much over the time horizon in which the data has been collected. Further, only the matches played by Team India are considered. In future, matches played by other teams could be analyzed to get deeper insights on the game of cricket Furthermore, analyzing the newer format of the game, i.e., T20 may also provide more understanding on the playing conditions and thereby the match outcome Note The terms Indian cricket team and Team India have been used interchangeably R EFERENCES  1  R.

processing. We call these çfile data sourcesé and çtable data sourcesé respectively. Our data sources pane has functionalities to create either table or file data sources by uploading a chosen CSV file, as shown in Figure 11   Figure 12. View Creation Fu nctionality \(left\ in operation \(right  3  Data Source Attachment Each data attach-point has a specific minimum schema  expectation to be able to make use of the data source attached. The minimum schema expectation makes some attributes mandatory. For example, a demographic data source is required to have a çCustomerIDé attribute that uniquely identifies each customer.  It may have any number of additional attributes; for example, in the unsupervised segmentation workflow, any additional attribute of a customer is used by the clustering algorithm to measure the similarity between customers. Often, the minimum schema attribute names may not exactly match the customerês attribute names. For example, the customer may use CustIDé to uniquely identify a customer whereas the attach-point may be expecting çCustomerIDé. We have incorporated a view creation facility that helps the customer to create a non-materialized view by mapping the attributes in her data source to those expected by the minimum schema. Once such a view is created, it appears as another data source, and can be chosen from the drop down list of data sources. Figure 12 shows how view creation functionality gives the user the option to pick an attribute from her source to the minimum schema attribute, in this case ID, CUSTID, TRANSACTIONDATE, and TOTALPRICE 4  Downloading Results We implemented the workflow execution as an asynchronous operation, where the user finishes the setup uploading data, attaching data sources, choosing the workflow to be executed\d clicks on çsubmité.

Cloud computing provides shared resources, software and information to computing devices as a utility over the network. It has become widely popular over the last few years and has been assessed to be no less influential than any of the previous trendsetting technologies [13   T h o ugh m a n y o b s ta c l e s to the u s a g e o f  cloud computing have been identified in e s a me report emphasizes that the utility of cloud computing is likely to outweigh its disadvantages. Cloud computing provides many advantages such as elasticity and transference of over-provisioning and under-provisioning risks. Forecas u g g e s t th at clou d co m p u t i n g  w oul d  grow at a very fast rate over the next few years.  Cloud computing has been used for a variety of tasks such as parallel data mining d g raph an al y tic s 16   Analytics Services Though popular analytics engines such as SAS, SPSS and R started off as stand-alone applications that need to be installed on a server to be used, recent trends suggest that commercial analytics engines are not far off from delivering full-fledged analytics capabilities on the cloud. Predixion Software 13 and Zementis 14 offer scoring of any PMML 15 model over the cloud, whereas SAS has started to offer many of their functionalities over the cloud  How ev er, to th e bes t of ou r k n o w l edg e, th ere h a s been  a very limited work on providing powerful analytics functionalities over the cloud that can readily be used without requiring considerable expertise in analytics and the specific tool to be used  Workflows for Analytics The main novelty of the solution proposed in this paper rests in the usage of configurable and extensible multi-workflows to make it easy to use analytics despite limited technical know-how. Analytics workflows themselves are not novel and are the primary means of using SPSS \(with the SPSS Modeler component\wever, a typical SPSS workflow is designed to be used by personnel who understand the semantics of typical data mining operations. In particular, SPSS provides a fleet of functionality that is powerful enough to be used across domains, and is not specific to the scenario in which it may be deployed. For example, the semantics of the CustID field is unknown to a generic clustering operator, and under a default setting, the clustering operator would use the CustID field also for clustering leading to the undesirable results of    13  http://www.predixionsoftware.com/predixion  14  http://www.zementis.com  15  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language

grouping customers with numerically close CustIDs together. We eliminate the need to explicitly specify the exclusion of such attributes, by folding in the semantics of attributes such as CustID \(among others\to the prepackaged workflows. In a pre-packaged workflow for customer segmentation, the fact that CustID needs to be excluded in clustering would already be already preconfigured. The customer can thereby focus on configuring other parameters that are likely to affect business such as number of clusters in the outp ut or the rules to use in designating customers as high-value or low-value. The concept of multi-flows, where a single template workflow can instantiate many possible workflows, has not been developed in prior literature to the best of our knowledge VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Analytics, despite its apparent utility in improving business has not been adopted widely. The main deterrents include the large upfront cost of procuring computing infrastructure and the cost of setting up an in-house analytics team of statisticians and business analysts. Such costs are so high that many small and medium businesses cannot afford traditional analytics solutions, especially in the developing regions of the world due to a spectrum of other deterrent factors that we have outlined. Many such deterrents may be effectively eliminated by the delivery of analytics services on the cloud. In this paper, we propose configurable pre-packaged multi-flows flows that span multiple workflows\ to deliver analytics services on the cloud towards helping to improve analytics penetration Multi-flows bundle together related workflows enabling users to explore and exploit related functionality by making minor configuration changes. We illustrate how changes to workflow configurations may be made easily without any in-depth knowledge of the various operators involved. Our multi-flows are easily extensible to non-disruptively include new functionalities in response to the changing needs of a customer \(or a changing customer base We described a survey of Indian retail players that helped us identify \(and validate our assumptions of\e primary obstacles to analytics penetration in the sector; we also analyzed the major analytics needs of such businesses. We illustrated that many such common analytics needs may be effectively captured within a small number of workflows We developed a fully-functional system that implements the chosen multi-flows for the retail sector. We detailed the various features of the system, the multi-ness of the flows in the system, and example configuration settings that can be used to fine tune specific multi-flows. Through generous usage of screenshots, we illustrated the ease of use of our system; we expect that such enhanced convenience of usage will aid penetration of analytics into new customer bases  Future Work We are exploring further enhancements to improve ease of use of analytics solutions on the cloud including an automatic mapping of attributes in data sources to attach-points by exploiting the data type and distribution Also, making analytics widespread would necessarily involve addressing some of the problems that are applicable to cloud computing in general. These include concerns about data privacy in the cloud and the loss of control of the computation elopin g techn iqu es  to eff ecti v el y an d  provably anonymize of data without affecting the results of specific operators such as clustering or classification is an interesting direction to pursue A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Abhishek Subramanian, Neethu Suresh Shubhendu Aggarwal and Varun Srivastava for efforts in implementing the system and performing market surveys VII  R EFERENCES  1  Todd Morrison, çRetail chain uses in-house analytics team to run SAP BusinessObjectsé, TechTarget Search SAP, 4 th March, 2011 http://searchsap.techtarget.com/news/2240033086/Retail-chain-uses-in-houseanalytics-team-to-run-SAP-BusinessObjects  2  Rakesh Agrawal, and Ramakrishnan Srikant, çFast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databasesé,  VLDB 1994, Chile 3  How to structure a business analytics team http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.in/2011/09/business-analytics-teamstructure.html Retrived March 2, 2012 4  MA Rappa, çThe utility business model and the future of computing services IBM Systems Journal, 43\(1\ 2004 5  Brian Hayes, çCloud Computingé, Comm.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
