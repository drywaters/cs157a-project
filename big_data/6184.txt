a modular and flexible bus for LEO \(Low Earth Orbit missions. Its first mission was the TET-1 satellite which was part of the OOV \(On Orbit Verification\gram of the DLR German Aerospace Center\and was launched on July 22 nd  2012. The next mission for the TET bus is the BIROS satellite which is planned to be launched in 2014 The bus was designed for altitudes between 450 and 850 km and an inclination between 53\260 and SSO \(Sun Synchronous Orbit\ Typical mission scenarios include earth observation and technology demonstration. Satellites based on the TET bus can be launched as a piggy back payload. The modular design allows the accommodation of different payloads without major 
changes to the satellite bus. This makes the TET bus suitable for most kinds of LEO missions Although TET-1 achieved a high reliability \(based on a elaborate redundancy concept and orbit experience\nd an excellent payload to spacecraft mass ratio, a study was performed to increase the capabilities even further. The TETX platform is a slightly improved version of the existing satellite bus. It shares the satellite envelope of 670x580x880mm\263 and 70 kg satellite bus mass with 460x460x428mm\263 payload volume and 50 kg payload mass The three-axis attitude control system provides a pointing knowledge of 10 arcsec and a position accuracy of 10 m. It contains new lithium ion cells, new transmitters and on-board 
computer. The spacecraft bus now provides up to 80 W steady state power and 160 W peak power to the payload and up to 155 Mbit/s data downlink with a separate payload transmitter or 6 MBit via satellite TM/TC \(Telemetry/Telecommand\are possible. Additionally, the design life time is increased to be from 3 to 5 years. Also, a slightly bigger platform, the TET-XL platform, was designed which has an increased payload mass payload power and is additionally equipped with an ADN Ammonium Dinitramide\ propulsion system. This results in 80 kg payload mass, 600x620x460 mm payload volume, 110 to 150W payload steady state and 460W payload peak power, 155 
Mbit or 400 MBit/s payload data transmitter and a deltaV capacity of 80 m/s. The satellite bus envelope is 800x800x845mm\263 and the bus mass is 120 kg. Furthermore, an increase in lifetime resulting in up to seven years was achieved T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1. I NTRODUCTION 1 2. T HE B ASIC D ESIGN O F T ET 1  A ND B IROS 2 3. N EW R EQUIREMENTS 2 4.

EFERENCES 6 B IOGRAPHY 6  1  I NTRODUCTION  During the last years, Astro- und Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH has developed the TET satellite platform designed as a high reliability system for LEO applications like earth observation and in orbit demonstration. Based on this design, two satellites, TET-1 and BIROS, were realized  Figure 1 \226 BIROS satellite using the TET bus TET-1 was successfully launched in July 2012 and has completed its OOV mission on 31 th October 2013. Due to the fact that TET-1 is still in full operational condition, the satellite was handed over to 
the FIREBIRD mission of the DLR and is used as the first satellite of this new fire recognition constellation, which will provide worldwide fire monitoring Meanwhile different projects using TET based systems are in discussion for national and international missions. But the requirements from the payloads and orbits exceed the technical capabilities of the original TET-1 design. That is why Astro- und Feinwerktechnik developed two new derivatives of the TET, the 120 kg TET-X space segment and the 200 kg TET-XL segment. While TET-X is only a 


  2 small enhancement of the payload and TM/TC capabilities is the TET-XL equipped with propulsion system and much more space, mass and power for the payload The designed technical specifications of the two new platforms and possible projects are documented in this paper 2  T HE BASIC DESIGN OF TET-1 AND BIROS The TET-1 satellite bus was designed as a modular and flexible microsatellite for LEO applications, with an altitude between 450 and 850 km and an inclination between 53\260 and SSO. The typical launch of a satellite based on the TET1 satellite bus is as a piggyback payload and typical missions are technology demonstration and earth observation missions The first mission for this satellite bus was the TET-1 mission, which was launched as part of the OOV program of DLR. Kayser-Threde is the prime contractor for this mission and Astro- und Feinwerktechnik was responsible for the satellite bus and DLR-GSOC \(German Space Operations Center\ for the ground system. The launch was provided by Lavoshkin with an SOYUS/FREGAT launch By applying redundancy consistently through the different system layers and by using space qualified and/or screened and qualified parts a high reliability calculated according to MIL-HDBK-217 could be achieved. TET-1 has also already exceeded its design lifetime, without major incidents Due to the high success of the TET-1 mission, the TET-1 satellite bus is used for the integration of the BIROS satellite \(see Figure 1\ of the DLR-IOS \(Institute of Optical Sensor Systems\which is the second satellite of the FIREBIRD constellation 3  N EW R EQUIREMENTS  In spite of the highly reliable design with excellent payload to mass ratio and attitude control capabilities Astro- und Feinwerktechnik has used the experiences from the TET-1 mission and inputs from the user community to design an upgrade of the satellite bus, according to requirements of different programs where TET was offered as a solution for the spacecraft \(e.g. DLR TET-2 and ESA IOD program On the one side was the wish for more power for the payload, but without mass and volume extension, aiming for low orbit missions, where a propulsion system would not be necessary, since the satellite would de-orbit in a reasonable amount of time by itself. Mainly used for single missions like TET-2 for the OOV program of DLR, but with design life time of 3 to 5 years. This concept results in the TET-X design On the other hand, there was the requirement for a system with much more power and mass for the payload, including a propulsion system for constellations and/or active deorbiting for higher LEOs. But the system should still be a piggy-back satellite system. These requirements resulted in the TET-XL design, with a design lifetime up to 7 years 4   T HE TET-X  P LATFORM  Basic Specification The TET-X platform \(see Figure 2\ a slightly improved version of the existing satellite bus. It shares the satellite envelope of 670x580x880mm\263 an d 70 kg satellite bus mass with 460x460x428mm\263 payload volume and 50 kg payload mass. The three-axis attitude control system provides a pointing knowledge of 10 arcsec and a position accuracy of 10 m. But it contains new power system, new transmitters and on-board computer, but same envelopes and masses. So the payload can now be provided up to 80 W steady state power or 160 W peak power and up to 155 Mbit/s data downlink with separate payload transmitter \(or 6 Mbit via satellite TM/TC\dditional the design life time is increased to be 3 to 5 years  Figure 2 - The TET-X platform A critical point in the design of the TET satellite bus as a multi-mission bus was the interface between satellite bus and numerous payloads. To support very different payload types a Payload Support System \(PSS\ is integrated in the TET bus \(see Figure 3\. The PSS is adaptable on its variable payload interface side to the interface requirements for payload data transmission & storage, payload control \(using Spacewire, RS422/485, CAN-Bus\d power interface requirements of the payloads Figure 3 - The TET Payload Support System The use of mission adapted payload support systems will permit to leave the TET satellite bus unchanged for different missions, however it can be adapted partly, as, for instance by using an X-Band transmitter, if higher data rates are required 


  3 The Printed Circuit Boards \(PCBs\ of the Payload Support Systems also allow an adaptation for new payload accommodations The TET Segment Design The TET satellite bus comprises three segments: the Service Segment, the Electronic Segment and the Payload Segment  Figure 4  The Service Segment contains the Power Control Unit PCU\wo redundant gyros systems \(AGS\our Reaction Wheels \(RWs\d two battery stacks The Electronic Segment contains the Payload Support System, the cold and hot redundant Spacecraft Bus Computer \(SBC\e Power Distribution Unit \(PDU processing boards of the redundant sun sensor system, the redundant GPS receiver and the driver electronic for the redundant magnetic coil system  Figure 4 - Segments of TET satellite bus              Additionally, the complete TM/TC hardware is integrated into the Electronic Segment, except the two low gain antennas \(for omni-directional communication\. The low gain antennas are mounted on: the payload segment and the bottom of the Service Segment The TET Payload Platform The Payload Segment contains the payload\(s\tself, parts of the Attitude and Orbit Control System \(AOCS\d one of the low gain antennas. The TET payload platform is the sole mechanical and thermal interface between the payload\(s and satellite bus. The TET payload platform allows an easy and fast integration of the pre-assembled payload\(s Although in the TET-1 mission it was not required, the TET payload platform can be also designed as an optical bench Board Computer and TM/TC The TET Spacecraft Bus Computer \(SBC\trols all activities of the satellite bus and consists of 4 identical SBC boards \(2 in hot, 2 in cold redundancy\nd watchdog circuits for failure detection and recovery. One node \(the 223worker\224\is controlling the satellite while the second \(the 223master\224 node\upervising the correct operation of the worker node The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems CCSDS\ndard compatible TM/TC system is based on a S-Band transmission system with two hot redundant receivers \(with 4 kbit/s uplink data rate\d two cold redundant transmitters with a downlink high bit rate of 6 Mbit/.  The two receiver/transmitter pairs can be switched to the omni-directional low gain antenna system or the high gain antenna            Figure 5 - The AOCS System \(acronyms see page 4

The AOCS algorithm uses a \223state estimation\224 system, and it is controlled in the SBC by autonomous monitoring of the \223timings\224 of all AOCS threads and processes. This is essential for a seamless filtering and processing of AOCS data The robustness of the TET AOCS is secured by redundancy of its hardware \(H/W\mponents and a \223configuration management system\224 to handle the redundancy by software S/W\what provides onboard failure detection and diagnosis. Its robust control loop permits to react against perturbation and component anomaly with sufficient stability margin  5  T HE TET-XL  P LATFORM  Basic Specification Due to requests by the community, the TET-XL platform allows increased payload mass, payload power, and is additionally equipped with an ADN propulsion system. This results in 80 kg payload mass, 600x620x460 mm payload volume, 110 to 150W payload steady state and 460W payload peak power, 155 Mbit or 400 Mbit/s payload data transmitter and a deltaV capacity of ~60 m/s. The satellite bus envelope is 800x800x845mm\263 and the bus mass is 120 kg Design Changes The new requirements of an additional propulsion system and a bigger and more challenging payload require a bigger envelope of the satellite and a little change in the internal structure design  Figure 6 - The segments of TET-XL But there is still the dividing in service segment, electronic segment and payload segment as seen in Figure 6  The on-board-computer, the TM/TC system and the AOCS are unchanged, except for scaled up actuators \(reaction wheels and torquers  Figure 7 - Top view electronic segment Due to the bigger envelope, the TET-XL contains max. 20 PCBs \(Printed Circuit Boards\or the Payload Support System and max. 20 PCBs for satellite bus electronics, each in the size of a Europe Card \(160 x 100 mm The free compartments will be used for the X-Band \(or KaBand\ayload Data Downlink transmitter and the boards for the higher payload data storage capability of TET-XL The higher power demand of the payload requires, on the one hand a bigger solar generator and on the other hand, a bigger radiator for heat radiation to space. Although the envelope of the satellite platform is bigger than on TET-X additional panels were necessary. It was decided to integrate a 5 panel solar generator instead of a 3 panel generator and add an optional payload radiator on top of the satellite Service segment Electronics segment Payload platform Bus structure p a y load se g ment  Satellite Board Computer \(SBC Payload data handling Payload supply system NVS free Compartments area of propulsion components Transmitter+Z Receiver+Z Receiver-Z Transmitter -Z 


  5  Figure 8 - The 5 panel solar generator A New Standard Propulsion System Due to the orbit and constellation maintenance requirements and de-orbiting requirements \(satellites should be reentered at least after 25 years in orbit\e TET-XL satellite bus is equipped with an ADN \(Ammonium Dinitramide monopropellant\lsion system. This system is similar to the one used for the PRISMA satellite and is manufactured by ECAPS, a subsidiary of Swedish Space Corporation It is much less toxic than a hydrazine system and has a better system specific impulse, due to a higher density of the fuel and a higher exhaust velocity \(2300 instead of 2100 m/sec\ith this propulsion system the TET-XL has a v capacity of more than 60 m/sec if the full payload capacity is used Optional Propulsion System In some cases the v capacity of the system would not be enough for the TET-XL platform. Different missions with such a higher v demand are just in discussion within ESA and Germany This are the reason why Astro- und Feinwerktechnik and EADS Space Transportation will start a design study this year to integrate electric propulsion systems, e.g. \265Rit into the TET platforms. The goal is to reach a v capacity higher than 200 m/sec 6  T HE P AYLOAD C APABILITIES OF THE TETP LATFORMS  The following table shows the main technical parameters of the TET-X and TET-XL satellite busses    Table 1.
