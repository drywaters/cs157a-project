These systems have received rapid and widespread interest and have been  adopted for military purposes  This military proliferation has encouraged the use of these systems in civil applications They have already been deployed on such missions as 1  law enforcement  2   wildfire management  3  pollutant studies  4  polar weather monitoring  5  and hurr icane observation  6 A recent study forecasts that by 2017 there will be 1500 civil UAS in service.  The same study expects that in 2017 the UAS civilian market will represent $560M of an estimated total UAS market of $5B  7    The surge in the use of U AS in military and civil application has enhanced their capabilities yet the reliability of these systems has not increased to a level that allows for their full and safe use and a guarantee of continuation as a valuable asset  Over the last decade alth ough a number of technological solutions to various UAS problems have been developed and advanced  including control sense and avoid and navigation  the specific UAV problems related to developing monitoring techniques and systems to avoid failures have be en largely overlooked   In a previous work t  Unmanned Aircraft Systems E ngineering \(UASE\ team has develop ed  an Airborne Sense and Avoid ABSAA algorithm for an unmanned aircraft system UAS that has shown to be increasing ly capable of  sensing and avoiding cooperative aircraft  8    The ABSAA system operates by detecting any local air traffic with the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast ADS B  Information from ADS B is used in calculating whether or not an avoidance maneuver needs to be made.  Most recently, the UASE team has successfully completed Terrain Avoidance and FAA Right of Way \(RoW\ compliance, which are now both fully implemented within the ABSAA algorithm structure  The UASE team also recentl y partnered with Mitre Draper  Laboratory and NASA for the Limited Deployment   Cooperative Airspace Project LD CAP to rigorously test the ABSAA algorithm through the use of a surrogate UAS provided by NASA in August of 2012, and in August and September  of 2013   In order to achieve full integration of UAS into the NAS UAS must be safe and reliable so it can be guaranteed to work properly with every encounter with an obstacle as well as within normal flight when there are no obstacles However, a comp romised UAS with a flight critical system degradation or failure can become dangerous in the NAS without proper health monitoring of the UAS subsystems These failures can cause the UAS to be unable to complete its mission or to even crash  By intelligen tly monitoring data streams from each flight critical system and the hardware subsystems the system can be tuned to avoid failures and allow the UAS to continue its mission.  In the event of a flight critical system failure the mission can be 


  2   safely abor ted by instructing the UAS to travel to a point where no harm can be done within the NAS   This paper describes a monitoring system that has the ability to monitor in real time both the hardware and software components of the UAS during flight operations a nd execute any actions that are necessary to handle or prevent any issues that might occur during an encounter with an obstacle as well as during normal flight   2   M ETHODOLOGY   For experimentation with the health monitoring system, the University of North   tilized the BTE Super Hauler, one of many small unmanned aircraft owned and operated by the University of  North Dakota  The aircraft  is controlled by a Goodrich Cloud Cap Piccolo II autopilot system with a corresponding ground station The rest of the system payload  consists of a GPS receiver  to provide the location of the ownship aircraft  a Navworx 600B UAT ADS B transceiver  which provides local air traffic data and a custom Gumstix Overo  Fire  computer on module \(COM\ which contai ns an airborne  sense and avoid system ABSAA   and acts as the UAS flight computer   The purpose of the health monitoring system  is t o verify in real time  that these flight critical systems are working p roperly and to handle or prevent any potential probl ems and discrepancies that may arise durin g the course of a mission  Each flight critical system has a corresponding data stream that is sent to the health monitoring  system for periodic analysis   T he se  flight critical sys t ems have been divided into four  major groups  the GPS autopilot ADS B and power supply   All of these systems are part of the core components of the UAS and are required to be fully operational in order for the UAS to maintain a f ully functional and safe system       Figure 1   Health monitoring system block diagram   In addition to the moni toring of these four  flight critical systems the health monitoring system also collects and tracks data from the outside environment through the use of various environmental sensors.  The main health monitoring program on the Gumstix COM bundles this information with battery level and power information  The whole process of collection and transmission of these environmental data packets is  handled by a m icrocomputer  an Arduino Due This microcomputer  sends this data to the COM via a serial connection It  also verifies that the  COM itself is working properly  A block diagram of data flow wi thin the UAS is shown in Figure  1   The GPS ADS B and autopilo t systems are all sources of external data for the ABSAA system  Autopilot and GPS data are sent to the ABSAA s ystem via a serial connection from  the autopilot  The autopilot provides information  status  ADS B data is obtained through another serial connection and provides local air traffic data  If either of these main sources become degraded or compromised the ABSAA system could possibly be impaired due to degraded or even nonexistent data  T he health monitoring system logs and monitors data from these sources and performs periodic analyses to determine whether or not data has been degraded or compromised In the event that autopilot data has been compromised the health monitoring system pr ovides warnings to the ground station and disables the ABSAA system entirely since it was determined that the autopilot data was found to be inaccurate and/or degraded which could result in potentially hazardous UAS  operations If the ADS B data has b een compromised the health monitoring system once again provides warnings to the ground station and disables the ADS B dependent portions of the ABSAA program   These systems are also monitored apart from the ABSAA system to determine if the individual sub sy stems are functioning properly  The health monitoring system logs and analyzes relevant status and transmission information in order to determine whether or not each system is properly receiving data  If it is determined that data related to the GPS or a utopilot has been degraded or has any problem or discrepancy, warnings are sent to the ground station and the ABSAA system is shut down in order to prevent any avoidance commands from being issued while these flight critical systems are compromised   ABSAA  program operation within the data it has received regard   is also monitored by the health monitoring system.  If the ABSAA system has a technical problem during normal flight operations the health monitoring system can res tart it or shut it down based on the problem as well as disable or tune its different features in order to maintain or increase performance   The payload conditions, including the power supply battery levels, are also monitored.  If any flight critical sy stem has a low battery, the ABSAA system will be shut down and the aircraft will be directed to fly towards the lost 


  3   communication waypoint  power supply is low the ABSAA program will be shut down however normal flight operatio ns will continue as long as the other flight critical systems are functioning properly    The environmental conditions monitored by the health monitor ing system via the Arduino Due include the pressure temperature humidity and CO2 levels of  nternal environment They are collected through a serial connection to the Due  The pressure temperature and humidity readings are collected through a Sparkfun USB Weather Board and the CO2 readings are collected through a K 30 10000 ppm CO2 sensor  I f there are any environmental discrepancies discovered, or if the conditions  components necessary actions will be taken depending  on the severity of the problem   The health monitoring system operates c yclically, as shown in Figure 2  It is constantly gathering data from all of the systems that are tracked namely the GPS autopilot ADS B environmental sensors and the power supply  After a time t  has passed an analysis of all data received between the last analysis and t  is performed  After a preliminary check to ensure that the raw data is valid and usable data packets received from each subsystem are parsed for relevant data  These new parsed packets are then pushed through the analysis functio n of the health monitoring system where they are passed to the corresponding parameter they represent  Finally the values are checked against predefined values that represent the upper and lower bounds of which a passed parameter should be  If any disc repancies are found, the health monitoring system alerts the ground station and appropriate action is taken based on the problem    The predefined values that the incoming parsed data packets are compared with are contained in a configuration file that can    parameters.  These values were defined through preliminary testing to find what a safe operating range would be for each parameter   For this health monitoring system seventeen different parameters  were tested for degradation and data validity These parameters could change depending on the aircraft used, however, these were found to be the most relevant of values to pred ict the health of the UAS  in the Super Hauler   Raw d ata packet frequency is o f utmost importance in keeping a fully operational ABSAA system An ABSAA system that bases its actions on only a few data points or on data that is obsolete can become inaccurate or even dangerous to any surrounding aircraft  There are five parameters th at measure the frequency of data packets in the health monitoring system.  Parameters are implemented that measure the frequency of packet reception from the GPS ADS B and autopilot systems  The frequencies of packet reception from the USB weather board  and K 30 CO2 sensor are measured separately in order to differentiate if one of the sensors is no longer operating correctly    Figure 2   Flowchart of the health monitoring program   The accuracy of the ownship   indicated by a metric defined by the FAA as the Navigation Accuracy Category for Position \(NAC p    rule in regards to ADS B requirements published in    Broadcast ADS B Out Performance Requirements To Support Air Traffic  p  metric is required to be greater than or equal to 8 this value means that the navigational accuracy of the ADS B UAT must be within 0.05 nautical miles of the actual position  16    A parameter in the health monitoring system tracks this data value in order to ensure that the ADS B is operating within the required limits imposed by the FAA   Parameters that track the battery levels for each flight critical system are also in pl ace  The battery levels of the GPS Gumstix COM autopilot and Arduino Due are all monitored to verify that they stay within operational limits  The autopilot battery level information is collected from the autopilot data packets and the COM and Due ba ttery voltages are tracked from packets from the Due  These parameters are also in place to ensure that the batteries are  not damaged from being discharged of too much voltage or from being overcharged   Data packets from the autopilot are also carefully moni  CPU is monitored.  A large amount of memory being used

This packet is parsed into two separate sub packets with each containing data from either the USB weather board or the K 30 CO2 sensor  Each packet contains a flag if the relevant sensor data was o btained followed by the data from the sensor in question  These values are then passed to their corres ponding parameters which track the internal temperature humidity and CO2 levels, as well as the atmospheric pressure   3   R ESULTS    The health mon  using a Software in the Loop SWIL setup  The system was rigorously tested in order to determine if the health monitoring system could efficiently identify any problem perform necessary actions to solve or mini mize the problem and then ver ify if it had indeed solved  the problem  correctly  Tests were divided into three major categor ies  the subsystems critical to the ABSAA program  the GPS  autopilot, and ADS B\, the ABSAA system as a whole and its payload, an d the environmental conditions    In order to test the major subsystems critical to the ABSAA program degraded conditions as well as failure of data entirely from each subsystem were simulated to determine if the health monitoring system was able to corre ctly identify the problem  and handle it proper ly  An appropriate response from the health monitoring system was handled in a manner that ensured that the vehicle would continue to operate safely.  These appropriate responses will eventually be set accordi ng to the guidelines still being  actively  d eveloped by the UAS community.  The results shown here are examples of some potential solutions to various scenarios that could occur during the course of a UAS mission   If the GPS or autopilot systems indicate degradation or failure of data  the health monitoring system stops avoidance commands fro m the ABSAA system and puts it o n a stand by status an d more closely monitors the degraded  healthy state the health monitoring system reactivates the ABSAA system and allows it to start issuing avoidance commands again.  If the stream is determined to have failed the health monitoring system sends the UAS to a pre designated lost communication waypoint and s huts down the ABSAA system to prevent avoidance commands being issued that are acting upon insufficient data.  Figure 3 shows an example flight path of this type of failure   When the ADS B showed degradation of data the health monitoring system indicated  an issue with the ADS B and more closely monitored the ADS  stream returned to normal all systems resumed as normal If the ADS B was determined to have failed the health monitoring system shuts down all parts of the ABSAA syste m that rely on ADS B to reliably operate the rest of the UAS remained operational  An aspect of the ABSAA program that addresses a degraded ADS B data problem by intelligently predicting parameters of this data is currently being developed    Figure 3   Example of failure. The health monitoring system shuts down the ABSAA system and directs the ownship towards the lost communication waypoint   T he t  degrading environmental conditions was conducted by simulating conditions that were on the edge and outside of the operational limits of the ABSAA system as well as the rest of the UAS subsystems   When any of the environmental conditions measured by the health  erature  temperature  it indicated the problem and tuned the ABSAA system to handle the degraded environmental conditions of the payload  If operational limits were exceeded it sent the UAS to the lo st communication waypoint and shut down the ABSAA payload to avoid sending inaccurate avoidance commands due to the degrading conditions and also to avoid possible hardware damage in extreme cases   When the health monitoring system detected a low battery on any of the subsystems, the problem was indicated and a warning was sent to the ground station.  If any battery was 


  5   critically low on any of the flight critical subsystems the GPS autopilot and Gumstix COM the ABSAA payload was shut down and the UAS was sent to the lost communication waypoint  If the battery for the Arduino Due was critically low, this portion of the ABSAA payload was shut down and the mission resumed without internal environm ental condition monitoring    Figure 4   Example of degraded ABSAA program performance   Testing of ABSAA system monitoring was performed by simulating degraded performance or a payload failure  If the health monitoring system discovered that the ABSAA performance was deteriorating it attempted to tune the ABSAA program to correct the issue If the attempt was                           unsuccessful the ABSAA program was shut down and the UAS was sent to the lost communication waypoint  An example of this type of failure is shown in Figure 4 Additionally the  health monitoring system was able to restart the ABSAA program in case the ABSAA system software crashed or experienced degraded performance   These tests demonstrated and verified the ability of the health monitoring system to effectively identify and pe rform necessary actions to handle any problems that arose during flight  These actions for each major type of probl em are summarized in Table 1 In general if there was a degradation of data for any flight critical system which includes the GPS autopil ot and ADS B the health monitoring system stopped the ABSAA system from issuing avoidance commands while continuing to monitor the status of the other subsystems as well as the degraded subsystem If there was a failure of a flight critical system the health monitoring sy stem shut down the ABSAA system completely and directed the aircraft to fly to the lost communication waypoint.  In the event of an environmental issue, the health monitoring system monitored the situation more closely and tuned the per formance of the ABSAA program  If the environmental conditions exceeded operational limits of the onboard equipment the ABSAA program was shut down and the ownship was sent to the lost communication waypoint Finally, if the ABSAA program failed to perf orm in an efficient manner the health monitoring system attempted to tune the ABSAA program  to eliminate the performance issue.  In a situation where the ABSAA program failed the health monitoring system attempted to restart the system, and if it was unable to do so sent it to the lost communication waypoint                          Table 1.

  6   4  F UTURE W ORK  While the health monitoring system has proven itself effective, the UASE team is continuing development of new features and improvements to this system  One major addition currently being created is a real time data analysis scheme to replace the current periodic analysis system.  This will allow for more constant data monitoring of individual systems which translates to the health monitoring system having a faster reaction time and even more efficiency than before.  This analysis will also keep a data ar chive of flight history to assist in identifying trends that could potentially cause problems in future flights  Another addition is of a battery level prediction analysis scheme  In an effort to improve the efficiency of the voltage monitoring portion o f the health monitoring system this analysis will predict how much longer a subsystem battery will last based on the rate of change of voltage over time.  This system will give the UAS operators ample time to anticipate how much longer a mission has to be  completed.  The data will also be used to tune the ABSAA payload system to conserve power if necessary to extend the life of a mission   In order to incorporate these updates, hardware upgrades are also being made  A new updated version of the Gumstix COM is currently being developed for implementation into the UAS for more computing capability for the continuing development of the health monitoring system  Other microcontroller options for the environmental sensor system are also being investigated to  further optimize the health monitoring system  5  C ONCLUSIONS   Unmanned aircraft can become compromised through a variety of failures within its subsystems  These failures include degradation of data degradation of system  performance or a hardware or s oftware issue  To address  this problem the UASE team at the University of North Dakota developed and tested a UAS health monitoring system to allow tracking and analysis of flight system data during flight operations and using this data to identify and handle an y problems that may arise  By monitoring the flight critical systems such as the GPS, autopilot, and ADS B as well as the payload environmental conditions and the integrity of the ABSAA system itself, the health monitoring system is able to acco mplish these tasks  The UASE team was able to demonstrate the ability of the health monitoring system in finding and handling a variety of problems that can affect the integrity of a UAS and the ABSAA system through rigorous testing using SWIL simulation t o replicate data degradation flight critical system failures, and deteriorating environmental conditions In each case, the health monitoring system was able to react properly and efficiently and find and execute the best course of action based on the pr oblem  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This research was supported by the North Dakota Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research ND EPSCoR/National Science Foundatio n grant  UND0018589 Rockwell Collins Charitable Corporation under grant  UND0017909, Depar tment of Defense contract number FA4861 06 C  Remote Sense and Avoid System and Advanced Payload  Laboratory contract number FA8650 09  Antenna for Wireless Communic ations Supporting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the Battlefield," and the North   authors would like to also acknowledge the contributions of the Unmanned Aircra ft Systems Laboratory team at UND   R EFERENCES  1  E  W    Fre w T  X  B r o w n   Net w o r k in g  I s s u e s  f o r  S m all Unmanned Aircraft Systems.

6.1.3 The Other Benchmarks Setup For SPEC CPU2006  we run the of\002cial applications with the 002rst reference input and report the average results into two groups integer benchmarks  SPECINT  and 003oating point benchmarks  SPECFP  HPCC is a representative HPC benchmark suite and we run HPCC with version 1.4 We run all seven benchmarks including HPL  STREAM  PTRANS  RandomAccess  DGEMM  FFT  and COMM  PARSEC is a benchmark suite composed of multi-threaded programs and we deploy PARSEC 3.0 Beta Release We run all 12 benchmarks with native input data sets and use gcc with version 4.1.2 to compile them 6.2 The Implication of Data Volume for Architecture Research Intuitively data input should be highly relevant to big data workloads characterization Speci\002cally the size of data input should be relevant to micro-architectural characteristics In this subsection we pay attention to an important issue\227 what amount of data quali\002es for being called big data from a perspective of workload characterization  This issue is very important and interesting because simulation is the basic approach for architecture research but it is very time-consuming Bigger input data size would signi\002cantly increase the run time of a program especially on the simulation platform If there is no obvious difference between large and small data inputs in terms of micro-architectural events the simulation-based approaches using small data sets can still be valid for architecture research As different workloads have different input data types and sizes we set the minimum data scales in Table 6 as the baseline data inputs e.g 32 GB for Sort  1000000 pages for PageRank  and 100 requests per second for Nutch Server  On the baseline data input we scale up the data size by 4 8 16 and 32 times respectively There are hundreds of micro-architectural events in modern processors For better readability and data presentation we only report the numbers of MIPS and L3 cache MPKI Figure 3-1 demonstrates MIPS numbers of each workload with different data scales From Figure 3-1 we 002nd that for different workloads the instruction executing behaviors exhibit different trends as the data volume increases For example MIPS numbers of Grep and WordCount increase after the 16 times baseline while for some other workloads they tend to be stable after the data volume increases to certain thresholds The cache behavior metrics also exhibit a similar phenomenon as the MIPS metric does As important as L3 cache misses are\226a single one can cause hundreds of cycles of latency\226we track this value for different workloads under different con\002gurations In Figure 2 for a workload we call the data input on which the system achieves the best performance as the large input for a workload and the baseline as the small input  From Figure 2 we can see Figure 2 L3 cache MPKI of different con\002gurations in big data workloads that some workloads have lower number of L3 cache MPKI on the large con\002guration e.g Sort  while some have higher number of L3 cache MPKI on the large con\002guration e.g Grep  There are the other workloads showing no obvious difference under the two con\002gurations e.g Index  K-means has the largest difference under the two con\002gurations and the number of L3 cache MPKI is 0.8 and 2 for the small and large data inputs respectively which shows different data inputs can result in signi\002cantly different cache performance evaluation results To help understand the micro-architecture events we also stress test the cluster system with increasing data scale and report the user-perceivable performance number as mentioned in Section 6.1.2 Because workloads in Table 6 have different metrics we set the performance number from the experiments with the baseline data inputs as the baseline and then normalize the collected results for each workload with varying data inputs over the baseline number For example the performance number of Workload A for the baseline input is x and that for 4 002 baseline input is y  and then for Workload A we normalize the performance number for the baseline input and 4 002 baseline input as one and  y 004 x  respectively Figure 3-2 reports the normalized performance numbers of each BigDataBench workload with different data volumes Please note that the performance of Sort degrades with increased data size in Figure 32 because Sort is an I/O intensive workload when the memory cannot hold all its input data Besides the larger data sizes demand more I/O operations like shuf\003ing and disk accesses Worse still the network communication involved in data shuf\003ing causes congestion thus impairing performance  Lessons Learned  As the abo v e 002gures sho w  we 002nd that different big data workloads have different performance trends as the data scale increases This is the reason we believe that the workloads that only cover a speci\002c application scenario are not suf\002cient to evaluate big data systems and architecture Second architectural metrics are closely related to input data volumes and vary for different work 


Figure 3 Performance data vary with different data input sizes loads and data volume has non-negligible impact on workload characterization For example the MIPS number of Grep has a 2.9 times gap between the baseline and 32X data volume the L3 cache MPKI of K-means has a 2.5 times gap between the baseline and 32X data volume This result implies that using only simple applications with small data sets is not suf\002cient for big data systems and architecture research which may impose great challenges 6.3 Workload Characterization This section mainly focuses on characterizing operation intensity and cache behaviors of big data workloads Figure 4 Instruction Breakdown 6.3.1 Measuring operation intensity In order to characterize instruction behaviors 002rst we breakdown the execution instructions As shown in Figure 4 big data workloads have the distinct feature that the ratio of integer instructions to 003oating-point instructions is very high On Intel Xeon E5645 the average ratio is 75 The maximum is 179  Grep  and the minimum is 10  Bayes  For comparison these ratios for PARSEC  HPCC and SPECFP are very low on the average 1.4 1.0 and 0.67 respectively The ratio for SPECINT on the average 409 is the highest because it is intended to evaluate integer operations of processors From this perspective we can conclude that the big data workloads signi\002cantly differ from the traditional benchmarks like HPCC  PARSEC  and SPECCFP  Please note that the reported numbers may deviate across different processors  For example Intel processors uses different generations of SSE Streaming SIMD Extensions which introduces both scalar and packed 003oating point instructions Furthermore for each workload we calculate the ratio of computation to memory access to measure the operation intensity Floating point or integer operation intensity is de\002ned as the total number of 003oating point or integer instructions divided by the total number of memory accesses in terms of bytes in a run of the workload F or e xample in a run of program A  it has n 003oating point instructions and m bytes of memory accesses so the operation intensi 


ty of program A is  n 004 m  Since the memory hierarchy would impact the memory access performance signi\002cantly for comparison we report experiments on two state-ofpractice processors the Xeon E5310 and the Xeon E5460 respectively The Xeon E5310 is equipped with only two levels of caches while the Xeon E5645 is equipped with three levels of caches The con\002guration of the Xeon E5310 is shown in Table 7 Table 7 Con\002guration details of Xeon E5310 CPU Type Intel CPU Core Intel R 015 Xeon E5310 4 cores@1.60G L1 DCache L1 ICache L2 Cache L3 Cache 4 002 32 KB 4 002 32 KB 2 002 4MB None In Figure 5-1 we can see that big data workloads have very low 003oating point operation intensities and the average number of BigDataBench is 0.007 on the Xeon E5310 and 0.05 on the Xeon E5645 respectively However the number of PARSEC  HPCC  and SPCECFP is higher as 1.1 0.37 0.34 on the Xeon E5310 and 1.2 3.3 1.4 on the Xeon E5645 respectively SPECINT is an exception with the number closing to 0 On the average HPCC and PARSEC have high operation intensity because of their computingintensive kernels and SPECFP has relatively high operation intensity for it is oriented for 003oating point operations In summary the 003oating point operation intensity of BigDataBench is two orders of magnitude lower than in the traditional workloads on the Xeon E5310 and Xeon E5645 respectively The reason the 003oating point operation intensity of BigDataBench on E5645 is higher than on E5310 can be partly explained by the fact that L3 caches are effective in decreasing the memory access traf\002c which will be further analyzed in next subsection Though the average ratio of integer instructions to 003oating-point ones of big data workloads is about two orders of magnitude larger than in the other benchmarks the average integer operation intensity of big data workloads is in the same order of magnitude like those of the other benchmarks As shown in Figure 5-2 the average integer operation intensity of BigDataBench  PARSEC  HPCC  SPECFP and SPECINT is 0.5 1.5 0.38 0.23 0.46 on the Xeon E5310 and 1.8 1.4 1.1 0.2 2.4 on the Xeon E5645 respectively  Lessons Learned  In conclusion we can say that in comparison with the traditional benchmarks the big data workloads in BigDataBench have low ratios of computation to memory accesses The above phenomenon can be explained from two aspects First big data processing heavily relies upon memory accesses Second big data workloads must process large volume of data and hence most big data workloads adopt simple algorithms with low computing complexity In BigDataBench  they range from Figure 5 Operation Intensity on Intel Xeon E5310 and E5645 O\(n to O\(n*lgn  In comparison most HPCC or PARSEC workloads have higher computing complexity ranging from O\(n*lgn to O n 3   We can make the conclusion that big data workloads have higher demand for data movements than instruction executions The state-of-practice processor is not ef\002cient for big data workloads Rather we believe that for these workloads the 003oating-point unit is overprovisioned 6.3.2 Memory Hierarchy Analysis Finally we show the operation intensity of the big data workloads is low and we want to further investigate their cache behaviors In this subsection we report L3 cache MPKI L2 cache MPKI L1 instruction MPKI instruction TLB MPKI and data TLB MPKI respectively We leave out L1D cache MPKI because its miss penalty can be hidden by the out-of-order pipeline From Figure 6 we observe that the cache behaviors of BigDataBench have three signi\002cant differences from the traditional benchmarks as follows First the average L1I cache MPKI of BigDataBench is at least four times higher than in the traditional benchmarks The average L1I cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 23 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 0.3 2.9 3.1 and 5.4 respectively This observation corroborates the ones in CloudSuite and DCBench The possible main factors leading to the high L1I cache MPKI are the huge code size and deep software stack of the big data workloads Second the average L2 cache MPKI of Big 


Figure 6 Memory hierarchy behaviors among different workloads DataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average L2 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 21 while that for HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 4.8 5.1 14 and 16 respectively Among BigDataBench  most of the online service workloads have the higher L2 cache MPKI on the average 40 except Nutch server 4.1 while most of the of\003ine and realtime analytics workloads have the lower L2 cache MPKI on the average 13 except BFS 56 Third the average L3 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 1.5 while the average number of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 2.4 2.3 1.4 and 1.9 respectively This observation shows that the LLC L3 caches of the processors Xeon E5645 on our testbed are ef\002cient for the big data workloads corroborating the observation in DCBench  The ef\002ciency of L3 caches also can explain why the 003oating point intensity of BigDataBench on the Xeon E5645 is higher than on the Xeon E5310 only two levels of caches The TLB behaviors are shown in Figure 6-2 First the average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 0.54 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 0.006 0.005 0.06 and 0.08 respectively The more ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench may be caused by the complex third party libraries and deep software stacks of the big data workloads Second the average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is also higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 2.5 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 1.2 0.7 2 and 2.1 respectively And we can also 002nd that the numbers of DTLB MPKI of the big data workloads range from 0.2  Nutch server  to 14  BFS  The diversity of DTLB behaviors re\003ects the data access patterns are diverse in big data workloads which proves that diverse workloads should be included in big data benchmarks  Lessons Learned  On a typical state-of-practice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that L3 caches of the processor are ef\002cient for the big data workloads which indicates multi-core CPU design should pay more attention to area and energy ef\002ciency of caches for the big data applications The high number of L1I cache MPKI implies that better L1I cache performance is demanded for the big data workloads We conjecture that the deep software stacks of the big data workloads are the root causes of high frond-end stalls We are planning further investigation into this phenomenon by changing the software stacks under test e.g replacing MapReduce with MPI 7 Conclusion In this paper we presented our joint research efforts with several industrial partners on big data benchmarking Our methodology is from real systems covering not only broad application scenarios but also diverse and representative real-world data sets We proposed an innovative data generation methodology and tool to generate scalable volumes of big data keeping the 4 V properties Last we chose and developed nineteen big data benchmarks from dimensions of application scenarios operations algorithms data types data sources software stacks and application types Also we reported the workloads characterization results of big data as follows 002rst in comparison with the traditional benchmarks the big data workloads have very low 


operation intensity Second the volume of data input has non-negligible impact on micro-architecture characteristics of big data workloads so architecture research using only simple applications and small data sets is not suf\002cient for big data scenarios Last but not least on a typical state-ofpractice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that for the big data workloads the LLC of the processor is effective and better L1I cache performance is demanded as the big data workloads suffer high L1I cache MPKI 8 Acknowledgements We are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd Dr

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
