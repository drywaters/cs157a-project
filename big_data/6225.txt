 Abstract 226 Association rule mining is used to uncover closely related item sets in transactions for deciding business policies.  Apriori algorithm is widely adopted is association rule mining for generating closely related item sets. Traditional apriori algorithm is space and time consuming since it requires repeated scanning of whole transaction database. In this paper we propose improved apriori algorithm based on compressed transaction database. Transaction database is compressed based on the consequence of interest     Keywords  Apriori, Improved Apriori, Association rule mining   I.  INTRODUCTION   There is a huge amount of data around us which can be used to extract valuable information. Data mining is the process of discovering interesting and expensive  information from large data. Association rule mining is one of the important techniques in data mining which is used to find association between various item sets from large transaction database. Apriori algorithm is one of the widely used algorithms for association rule mining. It was introduced by Agarwal in 1993 [1 it is a stro n g  algorithm which is used to find frequent item set. A basic property of apriori algorithm is \223every subset of a frequent item sets is still frequent item set, and every superset of a non-frequent  item set is not a frequent item set\224[1 p rio r i al g o rith m  is v e r y co st l y  in  ter m s o f  space and time complexity since it requires repeated scan of database res earch ers  h a v e  w o rk ed on improvement of apriori algorithm [2-8  L u o an d W  Wang in [3 a v e co n v e rted an ev en t d a tab a se in to m a trix  database, hence improving the computing time.

ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  Let I = {i1, i2, i3,..., id} be the set of all items in a market basket database and T = {t1,t2,t3,...,tn} be the set of all transactions. Each transaction t i contains a subset of items chosen from Item set I. A collection of one or more items is termed an item set. Support count is an important property of an item set. Support count refers to the number of transactions that contain a particular item set Mathematically, the support count i\or an item set i can be given as follows  i\{t i X t i t i  T An association rule is an implication expression of the form A B , where A and B are disjoint item sets, i.e A B   T h ere are t w o i m port a n t bas i c m e a s u res for association rules, minimum support and minimum confidence. Generally minimum support and minimum confidence are predefined by   user/analyst so that the rules which are not so interesting or not useful can be ignored. Support of A B is the total number of transactions where all items in A and B are together Confidence of A B, determines how frequently items in B appear in transactions that contain A. The formal definitions of these two metrics are given below Support \(A B A and B Confidence \(A B A and B A   III. APRIORI ALGORITHM  Apriori algorithm consists of follwoing  two steps a\ Join b\Pruining Apriori uses a level-wise search where K itemsets are used to find K 1  itemset Improved Apriori algorithm based on Selection Criterion  Dr.V.Vaithiyanathan 1 K.Rajeswari 2 Prof. Rashmi Phalnikar 3 Mrs. Swati Tonge 4 1 Associate Dean Research, School of Computing, SASTRA University, Tanjore, India 2 Associate Professor, PCCOE, Pune and Ph.D Research Scholar, School of Computing, SASTRA University Tanjore, India 3 Department of Information Technology, MITCOE,Pune, India 4 Department of Computer Engineering, PCCOE, Pune, India e-mail 2 raji.pccoe@gmail.com 4 swatitonge@yahoo.co.in  978-1-4673-1344-5/12/$31.00 ©2012 IEEE 


 1  First, the set of frequent 1- itemsets is found which is denoted by C 1   2  The next step is support calculation which means the occurance of the item in the database. Here it is mandatory to scan the complete database  3  Then the pruning step is carried out on C 1 in which the items are compared with the minimum support parameter. The items which satisfies the minimum support criteria are only taken into consideration for the next process which are denoted by L 1   4  Then the candidate set generation step is carried out in which 2-itemset are generated, denoted by C 2   5  Again the database is scanned to calculate the support of the 2-itemset. Accoring to the minimum support the generated candidate sets are tested and only the itemset which satisfies the minimum support criteria are further used for 3-itemset candidate set generation  6  This above step continues till there is no frequent or candidate set that can be generated  IV. PROPOSED WORK  Performance of the apriori algorithm can be improved if the database size The key idea for compressing the database is the interested class label. This is applicable in many applications like feature selection, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction f eatu r e s e lection  f o r any given dataset, the features can be analyzed, to find their association with the class label using Apriori algorithm. Rules are generated for item sets with expected minimum support and confidence. If the customer is interested on a specific class label, the tuples with this particular class label is taken for analysing the association level existing between attributes and desirable class label This method of selecting tuples based on desirable class label increases the efficiency of Apriori algorithm by reducing the number of iterations and time involved in finding association rules. As per example shown in Table I, suppose an analyst want to find all possible rules where I5 is the consequent. In this case the transaction T2, T3 T5, T6, T7 and T9 are simply ignored or deleted since these transactions does not have item set I5. The compressed database is shown in Table II           Now the performance of apriori will be improved since unwanted transactions are removed.  Assuming minimum support is 2 and minimum confidence 50 apriori requires 17 scan for the database given in Table I Frequent itemset are I,I2,I3 and I2,I3,I5. Rules are generated are given below I 1, I2 I5        Confidence=2/4=50%                          \(1 I 1, I5 I2        Confidence=2/2=100   2 I 2, I5 I1        Confidence=2/2=100%                        \(3 I 1 I2, I5        Confidence=2/6=33%                          \(4 I2 I1, I5         Confidence=2/7=29%                           \(5 I5 I 1, I2        Confidence=2/2=100%                        \(6                Rules 1, 2, 3 and 6 are selected since it satisfies minimum confidence.  Since analyst is interested in the rules where I5 is the consequent, rule 1 will be selected by the analyst. If compressed database given in Table II is used then Apriori algorithm will requires only 8 scans of compressed database   V  A LGORITHM   Algorithm Compress_Database is used to compress the database based on the interested consequences. Once the database is compressed, Apriori algorithm can be applied to get frequent itemset .

 VII  DISCUSSION The benchmark dataset is taken from University of California, Irvin ailabl e on li n e T h e g r aph  Fig 1  shown above gives a comparison between the Apriori algorithm and Modified algorithm in terms of Run time in seconds A p ri ori t a k e s 0.76 s econ d s f o r 10  minimum support and Modified algorithm with compressed database has taken 0.06 seconds for execution For a minimum support, more data items will be chosen and hence time required will be large  VIII  CONCLUSION  In this paper we have proposed an improved apriori algorithm based on compressed database. Database is compressed by deleting transactions which does not contain item set of interest as consequence. This compression is useful in feature selection and classification.

C AUSAL RULES  is a causal rule if 1 and are positively associated 2 The support of the association is greater than the minimum support threshold and 3 there exists a nonzero partial association between and  The support requirement makes it possible to use an efìcient frequent pattern discovery algorithm as a base for causal rule discovery R EDUNDANT CAUSAL RULES  Assume that if is a causal rule rule is redundant as it does not provide new information If is a causal rule may or may not be a causal rule However in either case it is not of interest to us Therefore we can terminate a search for more complicated longer causal rules when a causal rule has been discovered This reduces the search space If and are positively associated then  a superset of  may or may not positively associated with If and are not positively associated they cannot have a causal relationship and we should not test its partial association If and are associated then the association attributes to the association between and  Therefore no matter and are associated or not the rule is not of interest This leads to the following condition for testing the causal rules with combined factors C ONDITION FOR TESTING CAUSAL RULES WITH COMBINED FACTORS  We only test a combined causal rule if and have a zero association and and have a zero association This deìnition will serve as a forward pruning criterion where all variables positively associated with the target variable are excluded from the combination of future search This condition and the minimum support requirement make the search space manageable III A LGORITHM In this section we describe our algorithm for causal rule discovery and discuss its complexity The algorithm Algorithm 1 is designed based on our deìnition of causal rules Deìnition 6 as well the conditions for removing redundant rules and testing rules with combined factors as discussed in Section II-D Mining Causal Rules Input variable set U data set T support threshold s significance threshold  target Z Output Causal Rules Set R To save space at above we have omitted the details of the three key functions Generate Prune and PAssociation The algorithm makes multiple passes over the data In the rst pass we count the support of all the individual variables together with the outcome variable and summarise them in the corresponding contingency tables to conduct the Chi-square tests Positive associations and zero associations identiìed from the tests are kept Associations with insufìcient support will be eliminated directly Next we use a welldesigned method to do the partial association test with 2 contingency tables for each positive association The records of data set will rst be sorted and repeats are counted before the detection of partial associations If a record contains the value of a variable such as  the rest variable with value 1 will be treated as a condition set Conditioned on this set one pass over the records will produce a 2 contingency table as illustrated in table V Then the remaining tables for will be generated according to the ordered records Hence the nonzero partial association by Deìnition 5 could be detected The causal rules in current combined case can be determined from the nonzero partial associations At the end of the pass the zero associations found in the rst step are combined for the next pass until no causal rules are found There are several favorable properties to improve the performance of the algorithm The efìciency of the algorithm lies in the redundant rule property speciìed in Deìnition 7 Based on it the pruning technique is used in generating combinations of two or more variables to reduce the search space Suppose that the data set is a complete binary matrix and has no missing values each column of the matrix indicates a predictive variable and the outcome variable is listed in the last column QuickSort algorithm can be used to rank the records and merge the equivalence classes based on the features of the data so the total number of the records will be reduced remarkably especially in a database with large number of records Regarding efìciency not all the combinations are considered as a condition during the tests of partial associations Instead we only investigate the combinations appearing in the data which may be much

P280 in Table VIII is a causal relationship based on the CCC structure When the partial association test is applied to check if the casual relationship is persistent it fails to pass the test due to a low partial association value 3.250 As a result P5 P280 should be eliminated The result of the CCU method shows a small number of causal rules It is also a subset of the CCC causal rules but there are several different causal rules in the result which do not appear in Table VIII The same reason for the set of CCU rules it also contains a few non-causal rules In addition the CCU method works in an opposite direction compared to partial association test In the view of CCU we need to examine the association between different predictive variables Take the relation A B for instance we have to nd another predictive variable C which is independent of A but becomes dependent on A given B before we can determine A B to be a causal rule In other words to nd causal rules in CCU structures we must investigate the inîuence of the target variable on the associations among predictive variables Instead the partial association test investigates the inîuence of other predictive variable on the associations between predictive variables and target variable In conclusion it is reasonable for the two methods CCC and CCU to make a difference in the result especially in a large data set In discovering of causal rules we concern the global persistence of causal relationships and remove the inîuence of other predictive variables A lot of the positive associations may not pass the partial associations tests thus are eliminated so the causal rules deìned in this paper should be more reliable Besides the proposed algorithm is more Table X C OMBINED C AUSAL R ULES DISCOVERED WITH OUR METHOD  or  indicates positive or zero association for the single rules in the top part of the table and in the lower part of the table   indicates both positive association and nonzero partial association for the combined rules As 3.84 we determine that P3&P11 P280 and P11&P171 P280 are the newly discovered causal rules because they also have nonzero partial associations The result shows that the combinations of zero associated variables can generate combined causal rules such as P3&P11 P280 in which P3 and P11 are both zero associated with P280 respectively The combination of positive associated variables are thought to be redundant and provide little new information However P3&P11 P280 and P11&P171 P280 are new causal rules which imply that the interaction of zero associations can produce causal relationships Considering the CCC and CCU structures the zero associated variables are ignored directly Based on this our method could generate new causal rules which are not considered by the CCC or CCU method B Performance Apriori is the most fundamental algorithm for gener ating association rules in large databases It is implemented distinctively here to nd the association rules in regards to a given target whose causes we are only interested in discovering The scalable techniques for disco v ering the CCC and CCU causal structures are also used for comparison We select two subsets with record size 20K and

The system scales very well with dataset size because the SPARQL graph patterns are mostly evaluated with index-based nested loop joins, which tend to have execution times proportional to result size. Q5 shows the worst scalability because the execution cost is dominated by the regular expression filter on the unselective triple pattern, and the number of intermediate results that must be scanned for the regular expression filter grows significantly as the dataset size increases B  Computing SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment studied the overhead of computing sem_contains_count by executing two variations of the five sem_contains queries \(Table V\ against the LA130 dataset: \(1 sem_contains only and \(2 sem_contains  sem_contains_count The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 4. As expected, computing sem_contains_count adds some overhead. This overhead is proportional to the result s et size because the count has to be computed once for each document in the result set The overhead required to compute the count value is reasonable. For example, the overhead ranged from 0.001 sec Q2\ to 0.081 sec \(Q3\. The larger overhead observed for queries Q1 and Q3 can be attributed to the larger result size The overhead of computing sem_contains_count is relatively small for Q2, Q4, and Q5, which can be attributed to the fact that the result set size is small for these queries 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Query Number Execution Time \(sec sem_contains sem_contains + sem_contains_count  Fig. 4 Overhead for sem_contains_count on LA130 dataset C  Ordering Results by SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment tested the scalability of computing and sorting results by sem_contains_count as the query result set size increases.

0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 12345678 Partitions Accessed Execution Time \(sec Partitioned Non-Partitioned  Fig. 6 Benefit of partition pruning on LA130 dataset The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6. As expected, partition pruning shows a significant speedup in query execution time when only a few partitions are accessed The speedup ranged from 2.8 times faster when one partition is accessed to 1.2 times faster when three partitions are accessed. Not surprisingly, the benefit of partition pruning is reduced as more partitions are qu eried.  This can be attributed to two opposing factors in play In our implementation, each semantic index partition results in a single RDF model, so the non-partitioned index yields one large RDF model, and the partitioned index yields eight small RDF models. The single B  tree index structure, in case of non-partitioned table, is organized independently of the partitioning key pubdate and hence does not benefit from locality of reference when the query is selective requiring access to one or a few partitions. However, for the partitioned index case, the local indexes have triples grouped by pubdate which tends to perform better for selective queries. These benefits start to diminish as the number of partitions to be accessed by the query goes up and eventually the non-partitioned index starts to perform better. When all eight partitions are accessed, the query using the \(local partitioned index runs 1.4 times slower VI  C ONCLUSIONS  The paper presented the semantic indexing feature of Oracle Database, which allows indexing unstructured text columns to generate RDF content that can subsequently be searched with a SPARQL query pattern. It described a model of a semantic index that can be incrementally composed by a combination of base extractor policies, knowledge bases, and entailments. A model for querying semantic index was discussed that allows both searching for matching documents and/or matching triples. An experimental study involving TREC documents demonstrated the feasibility of our approach The proposed semantic indexing framework is intended to create a synergy between the database, semantic web, and information extraction communities. Specifically, the integration and inference benefits of semantic technologies become available for use against unstructured data in the databases. The semantic web community benefits as large volumes of RDF data, hitherto residing as unstructured text can now drive the development of semantic applications Information extraction community benefits as their technologies are put to immediate use by the database and semantic web communities Although extracted data, stored in standard RDF format, is amenable to querying, it tends to be verbose. Further work is needed, in conjunction with the information extraction community, to come up with levels of summarization that will also result in compact and efficient SPARQL query formulation. A more complete realization of the semantic indexing framework would involve work in several areas including optimized processing of blocking queries involving ancillary operators, devising s ophisticated ranking measures for capturing document r elevance, and incremental maintenance of entailments at the document \(named graph level A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Zhe Wu and Vlad Kolovski for providing support for named graph inferencing R EFERENCES  1  S G.
