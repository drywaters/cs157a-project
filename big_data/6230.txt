technological drivers of big data processing In this paper we apply analytical modeling to enable ef\002cient sizing of in-memory databases We present novel response time approximations under online analytical processing workloads to model thread-level forkjoin and per-class memory occupation We combine these approximations with a non-linear optimization program to minimize memory swapping in in-memory database clusters We compare our approach with state-of-the-art response time approximations and trace-driven simulation using real data from an SAP HANA in-memory system and show that our optimization model is signi\002cantly more accurate than existing approaches at similar computational costs Index Terms 227Optimization In-memory Databases Performance Closed Queueing Networks Approximation SAP HANA I I NTRODUCTION In-memory database systems leverage new technologies such as SDRAM 003ash storage FPGAs and GPUs to sharply optimize database throughputs and latencies Case studies show that in-memory databases can achieve tremendous speedups outperforming traditional disk-based database systems by several orders of magnitude As a result inmemory systems are in high commercial demand in particular as part of cloud software-as-a-service offerings This poses new challenges regarding the management of these applications in cloud infrastructures since there is virtually no architectural design sizing and pricing methodology focused explicitly on in-memory technologies This paper tackles this problem by introducing a novel provisioning framework speci\002cally tailored to in-memory databases We propose a novel optimization-based methodology to provision these systems at a reference timescale minimizing costs Our methodology can be applied to inmemory database clusters that are continuously monitored and feed performance measurements into our framework Our framework enables what-if analyses for various in-memory database con\002gurations regarding performance and cost without the need to set up experiments physically In particular we seek for load-dispatching routing probabilities that can load balance in-memory instances for a set of clients respecting the service level agreement 050SLA\051 in place with the customer We use a queueing modeling approach to describe the levels of contention at resources in order to establish the likelihood that a sizing con\002guration will comply to SLAs In particular since in-memory systems are memory-bound applications it is crucial that their sizing models can capture memory constraints as memory exhaustion and swapping are more likely to happen in this class of applications Conversely existing sizing methods for enterprise applications have primarily focused on modeling mean CPU demand and request response times Memory occupation is dif\002cult to model as it requires the ability to predict the probability of a certain mix of queries being active at a given time However probabilistic models tend to be expensive to solve leading to slow iteration speed when used in combination with numerical optimization To cope with this issue we introduce a framework based on approximate mean-value analysis 050AMVA\051 a classic methodology to obtain performance estimates in queueing network models W e observ e in particular that current AMV A methods are unable to correctly capture the effects of variable threading levels in in-memory database systems and propose a correction that markedly improves accuracy Our approach retains the same computational properties of AMVA and it is simple and inexpensive to integrate in optimization programs We also demonstrate that multi-start interior point methods and evolution strategies can be effectively used to solve the resulting optimization programs offering different tradeoffs between accuracy and scalability In particular we propose a simple yet fast mutation function for our evolution strategy that turns out to be competitive with interior point methods Finally we validate our approach using real traces from a commercial in-memory database appliance SAP HANA The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section II motivates our research objective and gives the problem statement Section III introduces the system characteristics of our in-memory database A novel response time approximation is developed in Section IV combined with a non-linear optimization program in Section V and evaluated in Section VI by numerical tests Finally Section VII outlines related work while Section VIII concludes this paper and gives future work II M OTIVATION AND P ROBLEM S TATEMENT In-memory databases are a completely new type of big data analysis systems capable of processing heavily memory intensive workloads in a parallel fashion Their resource management is a complex and dif\002cult task that includes memoryaware sizing of these systems across heterogeneous clusters Analytical

Fig 1 Relative Response Time Error compared with Simulation support these sizing decisions by enabling what-if analyses for various hardware con\002gurations It is therefore essential to develop models that are able to capture the behavior of in-memory databases across several dimensions In particular performance measures such as response times and throughputs are key metrics of in-memory systems that need to be modeled accurately However the extensive and variable threading-level we are faced with cannot be correctly captured by existing analytical approaches such as AMVA widely used to model the performance of multi-tier applications and stateof-the-art techniques i.e fork-join AMVA 050FJ-AMVA\051 To demonstrate this we parameterized these two methods from real traces of our in-memory database SAP HANA and compared their response time predictions with a validated inmemory database simulator W e gi v e an e xcerpt of our results in Figure 1 which depicts the relative response time error of AMVA and FJ-AMVA compared with our simulator under different workloads We observe that using both AMVA and FJ-AMVA can result in prediction errors of more than 50 We will therefore develop a new performance model that captures in-memory database characteristics more accurately Our second challenge is coined by a capacity planning problem assigning resources to in-memory databases subject to memory and utilization constraints Optimizing memory occupation for such systems can be computationally expensive and can introduce local optima due to non-convexity Hence we address this by proposing intelligent optimization strategies and combine these with our new performance model Summarizing our main contributions are 017 A novel analytic response time approximation for inmemory databases that considers thread-level fork join 017 An optimization-based formulation for seeking loaddispatching routing probabilities to minimize memory swapping for such systems subject to resource constraints 017 An experimental validation that reveals the applicability of local and global search strategies 017 Parameterization and evaluation of our models with real traces of an in-memory database system To the best of our knowledge there are no methods that combine thread-level fork join models with non-linear optimization of in-memory systems and thus represents a research novelty III I N MEMORY D ATABASE C HARACTERISTICS A OLAP Workload Characteristics In-memory databases are optimized to execute analytical business transactions i.e OLAP These types of transactions represent read-only workloads and can thus be entirely processed in main memory Due to their analytical nature OLAP 050a\051 Thread Level Parallelism 050b\051 Execution Times 050c\051 Memory Occupation 050d\051 Thread Times for t 024 8 Fig 2 Workload Characteristics normalized by Query Class 1 workloads are not only computationally intensive but also show high variability in their threading levels To emphasize these diverse characteristics we analyzed trace logs obtained from benchmarking experiments running SAP HANA on an IBM X5 4-socket database server con\002gured with 1TB main memory The benchmark w as run with a scale f actor of 100x and comprised a set of 22 OLAP queries introduced by SAP-H an extension to the TPC-H benchmark with emphasis on analytical processing We provide the results of our trace log analysis for all 22 query classes in Figure 2\050a\051-\050c\051 All values are obtained from isolated query runs normalized by class 1 for con\002dentiality and shown with their respective standard deviations In Figure 2\050a\051 we present the average number of CPU cores used by each query class and denote this with thread level parallelism As expected we see a strong variability of the parallelism across all query classes which can increase contention for resources under OLAP workload mixes This attains further distinction due to the varying computational expense of OLAP queries depicted in Figure 2\050b\051 In addition we reveal the memory intensive character of OLAP workloads in Figure 2\050c\051 by showing the physical memory temporarily occupied during the processing of queries which varies on gigabyte scale To emphasize the importance of compression during the execution of OLAP workloads we demonstrate in Figure 2\050c\051 that our corresponding benchmark dataset with a size of 1.3 TB was reduced to approximately 65GB after a warm-up run for each query class B Request Handling and Demand Characterization Query planning and execution are important stages during the processing of OLAP workloads The 002rst stage involves a query planner analyzing the query structure and creating an appropriate execution plan In the second stage queries are executed depending on their assigned execution plan which 


Fig 3 Service Demand Estimation for an OLAP Query de\002nes the number of threads to be requested from an internal thread pool in order to service a query All threads pertaining to a query process are then assigned to processing cores for execution and are synchronized before a query can leave the system Kraft et al captured this beha vior from our traces to parameterize their in-memory database simulator We therefore review this process brie\003y and subsequently extend it for use with our analytical model Since our traces contain information from isolated runs for all 22 available query classes also denoted as job classes we can estimate two important model parameters on a per-class basis In particular we are considering the service demand d r and the parallelism l r  While d r accounts for the average time required by our in-memory system to service one job of class r  l r describes the number of CPU cores used on average by query class r  In Section IV we want to compare our performance model with FJ-AMVA and the simulator developed in Ho we v er  all three approaches require a different representation of d r  Hence we will show in the following how to extract d r appropriately To better illustrate this process we represent our traces in Figure 3 by an exemplary job that consists of 7 threads and is executed on a 4-core system Figure 3 Case 1a shows the core activity which was sampled during the execution of our job We see that over time all 4 cores were differently utilized i.e attributable to stalling threads or changes in thread af\002nity Based on the sampled core activity we divide the execution process of a query into P processing phases as illustrated in Case 1b Each processing phase is de\002ned by its duration b p and its number of active processing cores c p  i.e 4 active cores in processing phase 1 and no active cores in processing phase 3 As mentioned above the extraction of processing phases and active cores was done in  since their simulator requires the parameters b p and c p  However we extend this process for use with our analytical model and determine d r and l r as aggregates of these measurements d r  P P p 1 b pr and l r  d r 000 1 P p b pr c pr  In addition to the core activity our traces record the number of threads J r pertaining to a class r job execution process as well as the execution times of each individual thread excluding the duration in which a thread was not active This information was not considered by and thus prompted us to extract it from the raw traces We illustrate this in Figure 3 Case 2a which lists all 7 threads that belong to our exemplary job We denote the execution time of each thread t pertaining to a job of class r with s t r and since FJ-AMVA speci\002cally requires this representation we will use s t r for its parameterization in our experiments Additionally FJ-AMVA assumes that J r 024 I  However for some classes and also for our example with J  7 and I  4  this is not the case Hence we sort s t r and use only the 002rst t 024 I longest running threads shown in Case 2b We justify this as for the majority of classes in our traces where J r  I  s t r 024 0  2 s for t  I  This means that these threads were not sampled accurately since used a sampling interv al of 0.2 seconds IV F ORK J OIN M ODEL In this section we study queueing performance models for in-memory databases based on multi-core processors In addition we propose an ef\002cient analytical approximation to these and present all relevant notation in Table I A Modeling an in-memory Database Performance models for in-memory databases need to be aware of the complexity introduced by OLAP workloads and require a contention model that accurately captures hardware and application characteristics Emphasized by the high level of query parallelism shown in Figure 2\050a\051 fork-join queues prove to be an appropriate choice for modeling an in-memory database We therefore apply fork-join queues to model the processing cores of such a system In particular we consider processor sharing 050PS\051 queues in the sense of Baskett et al  i.e where service times are i.i.d generally distrib uted We employ multiclass closed queueing networks 050QN\051 with a think time model that represents an abstraction of client think time and inter-activation times of worker threads in the database which are dependent on the admission buffer and thread pool size In Figure 4 we present our queueing model It captures the behavior of jobs split into several tasks on arrival at the system which are then assigned to processing cores in a probabilistic manner This includes the synchronization aspect of parallel siblings at the join point and the return to the think time buffer once a job is completed Approaches to solve this type of QNs via simulation e.g in  emphasize the dif 002culty in 002nding analytical solutions W e will therefore discuss available approximations to QNs before we introduce our novel analytical response time correction to fork-join queues B Approximations to Fork-Join Queues The widely used exact analytical solution for closed QNs known as mean-value analysis 050MVA\051 determines the response time W ir for a job of class r at queueing center i depending on the total number of per-class jobs  N in a system

demand d ir  v ir s ir  the product of per-class service time s ir and visits v ir  The arrival instant queue A ir 050  N 051 counts for the total number of jobs queuing or being serviced at i at the arrival instant of a job of class r  Based on the arrival theorem for closed QNs A ir 050  N 051 can be expressed as Q ir 050  N 000 1 r 051  which designates the queue length with one class r job less MVA is applied in recursive fashion but despite being analytical it gets intractable for problems with more than a few customer classes This is addressed by Bard-Schweitzer  proposing an approximate MV A 050AMV A\051 that emplo ys a 002xed-point iteration and estimates A ir via linear interpolation A ir 050  N 051 031 050 N r 000 1\051  N r Q ir 050  N 051  R X s 1 s 6  r Q is 050  N 051  0502\051 Synchronization in fork-join queues introduces temporal delays that cannot be described with the above product-form models As MVA and AMVA are not applicable in that case more recent approaches tried to address this aspect 11 Alomari et al propose a response time approximation called FJ-AMVA that sorts per-class residence times in descending order and scales them by an appropriate coef\002cient for better estimation of the synchronization overhead This approach assumes s ir to be the mean of the exponentially distributed service times  S ir  It can be shown that if s ir are the same at every queue for a particular class r  max i 050 s ir 051 002 H J r equals s 003  E max i 050  S ir   where s 003 becomes the maximum service time of a job and H J r  P J r j 1 j 000 1 denotes the jth harmonic number for job class r  In the heterogeneous case s ir can vary across the queues for each job class which results in less synchronization time FJ-AMVA approximates this by multiplying W ir with 1 i instead of H J r  However the forkjoin approximations in 11 are less suitable for our model as both assume exponential distributions of s ir  By contrast our service times s ir and s t r show a generally low variability We point this out in Figure 2\050b\051 and 2\050d\051 by listing the perclass execution times and their standard deviations as well as the 002rst 8 longest running threads for a subset of our query classes This justi\002es the need for a response time correction that does not rely on exponential service times C Response Time Correction Thread-level fork-join cannot be expressed with 0501\051 We therefore propose an analytical response time correction called TP-AMVA which considers the placement of tasks in forkjoin queues In particular we approximate the fork-join construct with only one single queue which decreases processing TABLE I M AIN N OTATION   Symbol  Description   Workload Parameters   R  Number of query classes

their mean queue-length will be the same Thus if we want to enforce SLAs it is suf\002cient to consider the expression of just a single arbitrary queue Moreover since we consider jobs to not cycle

by employing the AMVA 002xed-point iteration In addition we approximate the utilization in a fork-join system with U  R X r U r l r  I  0505\051 Before we evaluate this model we present an alternative approximation to 0503\051 which is an empirical calibration It follows the idea that an arriving class r job affects W r depending on its probability p r being routed to a particular queue in the

approximations produce reasonable results under different workload mixes and are highly competitive compared with FJ-AMVA During our evaluation we denote the implementation of 0503\051 with static TP-AMVA and 0506\051 with probabilistic TP-AMVA D Evaluation In this section we will evaluate our correction against the in-memory database simulator in under dif ferent scenarios and include the FJ-AMVA into our comparison a\051 Experimental Setup We implemented FJ-AMVA and TP-AMVA in MATLAB and conducted several experiments for different workload scenarios based on the categories light medium and heavy Whereas light mixes contain mostly query classes with small degrees of parallelism and shorter execution times heavy mixes comprise query classes with high parallelism and longer execution times To further vary the workload we increased the number of concurrent users from 1 to 32 Throughout all scenarios we used a 002xed think time extracted from the single user scenario in our trace logs We used the following parameterization for the simulator TP-AMVA and FJ-AMVA To increase its capability of capturing resource contention more accurately we parameterized the simulator with the 002ne grained query characteristics de\002ned by b pr and c pr  introduced in Section III-B For TP-AMVA we used the aggregated service demand d r  In contrast FJAMVA needs to be parameterized with the service times of jobs at each queue s ir  We therefore mapped s t r  which naturally represents the service times needed by FJ-AMVA onto s ir  As a problem of our traces there was no information about the placement of threads available Hence we addressed this by applying a Monte Carlo Simulation choosing random permutations of s t r  f s 1 r   s t r g with 1 024 t 024 J r and assigning them to queue t 1 024 t 024 J r  before running FJ-AMVA We then took the average response time of 100 iterations which seemed reasonable to produce stable results Moreover the task scheduling system in the simulator required equal routing probabilities to each core as does our implementation of TP-AMVA FJ-AMVA in contrast de\002nes its routing probabilities p r as probability that a single queue in the fork-join construct is visited by job class r  For this case we assumed J r I to be a suitable approximation of p r and thus we used p r  J r I to parameterize FJ-AMVA b\051 Results We show the results of our experiments in Figure 5 accompanied by Table II which depicts the mean relative response time error compared with simulation To give 050a\051 Scenario 1 050b\051 Scenario 2 050c\051 Scenario 3 050d\051 Scenario 4 Fig 5 Response Time Results under OLAP-based Workloads an impression of how the standard AMVA implementation 0502\051 performs we list its mean relative error for a run with d r  s r and a run that takes the visit ratio into account by d r  l r I 002 s r  As expected AMVA clearly shows a poor overall performance In contrast both static and probabilistic TP-AMVA perform reasonably well throughout all scenarios and follow the trend of the simulator Both approximations tend to be more pessimistic once the number of users increases whereas the response time prediction under light load appears to be slightly optimistic i.e scenario 3 In general our probabilistic TP-AMVA captures contention effects better than its static version staying below a 20 error rate Surprisingly FJ-AMVA lacks in its accuracy across most scenarios Its response time prediction is too optimistic under medium mixes i.e scenario 3 and too pessimistic under lightmedium load 050scenarios 1 and 2\051 In most of our scenarios we observed a very pessimistic start for FJ-AMVA when only few concurrent users are active This can be explained when looking at the parallelism of our query classes Some of our queries such as class 1 are highly parallel with s t r 031 d r  8 t  and thus contain almost no synchronization time This is why the summation over W ir in FJ-AMVA despite its scaling factor 1 i  results in a response time that is too high However this effect seems to diminish when the load grows and better re\003ects the increasing congestion for those cases From the results we conclude that FJ-AMVA in its proposed form is not suitable for modeling OLAP-based query workloads whereas our correction turns out to be reasonably accurate and due to its simplistic model a good choice for the optimization program we present in the next section V O PTIMIZATION P ROBLEM Given a parallel system with memory and resource constraints such as an SAP HANA in-memory database cluster we are interested in how to dispatch workloads while 


Fig 6 Model of an in-memory Cluster Subject to Load Optimization minimizing memory swapping We further include utilization constraints to avoid under-provisioning in such environments by limiting the CPU utilization per server In order to solve this constrained problem we develop a non-linear optimization program based on our approximation probabilistic TP-AMVA taking above mentioned constraints into account A Cluster Model We consider a simpli\002ed model of an in-memory database cluster with K servers see Figure 6 This model contains a separate fork-join closed QN for each server which simpli\002es the evaluation However the servers in our cluster are not completely independent but share the same workload  N  We therefore de\002ne N ir  N r 002 p ir  1 024 i 024 K as the percentage of workload that goes to server i  with p ir designating the probability of routing a class r request to server i  B Non-linear Optimization Problem Our optimization program aims to reduce memory swapping by minimizing the overall memory occupation M of an in-memory database cluster In particular we are seeking routing probabilities p ir that allow for near optimal workload placement This results in the optimization problem given by Equation 0508\051 with its decision variables p ir  throughput X ir and response time W ir  Note that two of the three performance measures Q ir  X ir and W ir must be chosen as decision variables given that we have two degrees of freedom in the relations of a closed queueing network To reduce the model complexity we estimate M for each server by multiplying the per-class queue length with the per-class physical peak memory consumption m r  0508b\051 We hereby make the pessimistic assumption that memory occupation grows as a function of the queue length Q and neglect that query classes could share data residing in main memory Additionally we assume that forking of new threads and joining is not related to the change of memory consumption We integrated our probabilistic TP-AMVA in 0508c\051,\0508e\051 and 0508f\051 based on the steps of an AMVA 002xed-point iteration We further de\002ned 016 irs  050 N ir 000 1\051 N ir 002 050 l ir I i 051 for s  r and 016 irs  1 in case of s 6  r  In addition we added memory and utilization constraints in form of M max i and U max i and ensure correct routing probabilities with 0508i\051 From a performance point of view our method uses less variables compared with FJ-AMVA which would introduce M 2 additional binary variables to sort the response times This gets further attention when looking at the nature of our optimization problem which is non-convex Hence we expect the number of local optima to grow when increasing the number of classes and servers as well as introducing different constraints for each server This exacerbates the problem of 002nding a globally optimal solution and requires strategies such as multi-start optimization M min  min p ir X ir W ir K X i 1 M i

effects the memory occupation in a cluster of in-memory databases under given resource constraints We are further interested in how the performance and accuracy of multi-start based approaches for our optimization problem compare with each other A Evaluation Scenarios We varied the number of server instances and classes in K R  2  4  8  16 and the workload N in 8 K 050light load\051 and 32 K

selection 100 times to produce 025  100 mutants in each generation In particular we had to develop our own adaptive mutation to alter individuals obeying the constraints 0508i\051 and 0508j\051 To create a mutant we randomly select a server x and a class y and subsequently modify the routing probability p xy by adding a new value 001 p  We choose 001 p uniformly from the interval  p xy 000 p xy  050\050 g mod 20\051  1\051  p xy  0501 000 p xy 051  050\050 g mod 20\051   The amount of change introduced by this mutation in form of 001 p is adapted throughout the optimization depending on the current number of generations g  Moreover we determine the 002tness of each individual by its memory occupation M  To ensure compliance with the given constraints our implementation penalizes violations of 0508k\051,\0508l\051 by impairing the 002tness Finally from the 120 individuals after mutation the 20 002ttest are selected into the next generation We have also tested a different implementation of our optimization based formulation in 0508\051 using YALMIP Ho we v er  we ha v e found that the results using this approach were qualitatively very similar Due to limited space we do not report the full details of these additional experiments which may be found in our technical report C Evaluation Methodology We implemented our approaches in MATLAB employing fmincon and its interior-point algorithm for fm  while es relies on an evolution strategy Moreover method es does not depend on MATLAB proprietary toolbox functions and therefore could be implemented in another programming language to further decrease processing time Our scenarios were evaluated on an Intel Core i5 CPU with 2.60GHz and two physical cores To cope with different local optima we randomized P  10 initial points for every tuple 050 K R N=K 051 and ran fmincon using MATLAB's MultiStart solver Subsequently we report the average of the cumulative execution time for all P local solver runs at a timeout of 1800 seconds to understand the performance at short time scales TABLE III M EMORY O CCUPATION AND E XECUTION T IMES  T IMEOUT  1800 S y    Instances Memory Occupation in GB Time in s     K

optimization program for the two methods fm and es in Table III We further report the cumulative execution time for fm and the time until the 002rst non-violating solution es-fS  was found by es  At 002rst we were interested in how clustering of classes affects memory optimization In our case we observe an inversely proportional behavior of the memory occupation M once the number of classes R increases i.e instances 0502,2,8\051 and 0502,8,8\051 This can be explained by the way we calculate N r from the 002xed ratio N=K  but comparing the instances 0502,2,32\051 and 0502,8,32\051 where N r  8 for both cases we see that a large difference in M remains We also discover non-monotonicity in the overall cluster utilization U with increasing R  We show this in Table IV for a light and heavy load scenario We impose this on classes with high parallelism and long execution times that are less often merged into a cluster with short running and sequential queries when R increases as depicted in Figure 7 From this we conclude that the more classes are aggregated the more inaccurate gets the estimate for M and U  given that the ratio N=K remains constant Another question we wanted to address is how our optimization program handles workload placement under the given constraints M max i and U max i de\002ned in section VI-A We therefore investigated the two instances 0508,2,8\051 and 0508,2,32\051 in more detail which represent light and medium load scenarios Table V shows the routing probabilities p ir and per-server memory occupation M i for the two solutions found by fm  Under light load we see that fm tries to achieve as little interference as possible between the two classes resulting in max i 050 M i 051  52  4 GB Moreover as no constraints are violated the placement can be an arbitrary permutation across i  but needs to remain 002xed for r  Once the workload grows to N ir  128  which is a normal scenario for SAP HANA dealing with more than 128 parallel connections the memory

At this point we observe a workload shift towards servers 1-4 occupying 250  9 GB on each This suggests that our approach is able to optimize constrained workload placement reasonably well Our methods fm and es produce similar results regarding M for instances where all P solver runs completed successfully i.e 0508,2,8\051 We explain this due to the same algorithm that is used to solve the queueing models For cases such as 05016,4,32\051 fm produced slightly worse results than es  as in the 002xed amount of time only one starting point could be processed In general given a suf\002ciently large number of initial conditions fm seems to be more accurate We impose this on the capability of interior point to better converge at small step lengths during the optimization process Looking at the execution times we see that fm is able to 002nd solutions in less than 1800 seconds for 8 servers and 8 classes if not necessarily for all P initial conditions Our evolution strategy seems more ef\002cient since it reports the 002rst solution after 25 seconds in scenarios such as 05016,8,32\051 where fm was timed out before a single successful solution was found We explain this due to the implementation of es  which involves less evaluations of the objective function per iteration Summarizing the results we showed based on empirical evidence that class aggregation can lead to inaccurate memory occupation and utilization estimates that our optimization program can load balance in-memory systems respecting given resource constraints and 002nally that interior-point based methods using multi-start approaches perform more accurately than global optimization strategies but become intractable under large scenarios of more than 16 servers and 4 classes VII R ELATED W ORK Research into in-memory database performance started in 2002 when introduced fundamental cost models including the entire memory hierarchy in a database system Nowadays on-demand provisioning of these systems drives research further into database optimization employing QNs In classi\002cation-based machine learning is used to schedule tenants in multi-tenant databases The authors characterize tenant and node-level behavior based on performance metrics collected from database and OS layer and validate their framework in a PostgreSQL environment However in this work scheduling constraints are only approximated Workload characterization and response time prediction via non-linear regression techniques for in-memory databases are proposed in The authors deri v e tenant placement

join and per-class memory occupation in in-memory systems In addition we have developed an optimization based formulation that facilitates our analytic approximation and ef\002ciently seeks for load dispatching routing probabilities to minimize memory swapping in inmemory database clusters Furthermore we have shown that our models exceed the accuracy of existing approaches using real traces from a commercial in-memory database appliance SAP HANA for validation Possible directions for future work include further validation of our models with different hardware con\002gurations as well as an evaluation of the applicability of our models with respect to other in-memory systems e.g Shark/Spark 29 In addition our provisioning framework could be implemented in a real in-memory database system

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given

UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
