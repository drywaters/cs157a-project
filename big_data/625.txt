254 255 Abstract 227As digital resources increasingly growing and the economic benefit of digital intellectual property rights being increasingly important, people has been increasingly emphasis on information security issues brought by the data remnants in storage devices. They try their best to prevent the potential risks In this paper we survey comprehensively related technologies standards and trends of erasure discuss the shortcomings of techniques on adding secure deletion to file systems and on cryptographic to prevent deleted data from being accessible. We focus on secure deletion mechanism in the NTFS file system combining the asynchronous I/O multi-threading technology Finally we present a novel data erasing algorithm, Quick Erase which not only greatly exceeds the speed of the existing international data erasing algorithms but also can be easily combined with a variety of standard algorithms to form various high-speed mixed erase algorithms It can be used to erase file data and metadata to ensure the security and reliability of data erasing.  The test result of Quick Erase indicates that the erasure speed of one big file has reached 10-12 s/100MB, faster than that of existing secure deletion tools 60-80s/100MB The algorithm 
has good application prospects for practical applications Index Terms 227Secure Deletion Multi-thread asynchronous I/O Data wiping I I NTRODUCTION n modern networks and information storage systems data recording systems have become essential equipment, which carry a large number of important or sensitive data, such as confidential business information or national secrets even personal privacy Once these data recording system disappeared or data stolen the consequences would be disastrous if there is no effective high-tech means to removal or destroy these data Currently a number of important research institutions governments and enterprises are undertaking researches experiments and product sales in secure deletion area 1  3   5    T h i s p a p e r  h a s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  i n v e s t i g a t i o n  i n  t h e  field of disk wiping technology and comparison the erasure effectiveness of various data erasure methods Finally we present a novel algorithm that can effectively improve Manuscript received March 28, 2008.

ensures data not be recovered. Nowadays, many countries are studying secure deletion algorithms and detection mechanisms Therefore this paper surveys comprehensively researches on this issues and divided existing erasing technology into five categories 1\ Cryptographic technique is a good technique in protection of Dynamic data. MS\222s Encryption File System \(EFS\ [6  c a n  encrypt files, directories, or whole file systems with individual keys, but the key management in encryption system is a very crucial problem to resolve, because once the key was sniffed, it could be used to decrypt both deleted and undeleted data 2 Changing operating systems so that files are actually overwritten when they are unlinked from the system is another solution [8    3\ Physical destruction is the best and the safest way to erase data Generally include degaussing chemical corrosion shredding, burning 4\ Using a novel method, Dead on Demand Digital Shredder to secure erase data NIST Special Publication 800-88 states that the method is quickly earning market acceptance, as well as receiving growing public awareness [4  5 Data erasing Based on the software model is also often called secure deletion tools there are usually two erasure modes, one is to use disk I/O mode to overwrite, and the other is 
to use the operating system file drive interface to overwrite the disk.

cyber activists and their online communities For example it has been observed that web sites of related activism groups are linked to each other through hyperlinks creating their own community network 6   A  g o o d  r e s e a r c h  f r a m e w o r k  w o u l d  include an effective method to identify such networks and the roles of the web sites in the networks In forums social networks of forum users, representative topics and phrases, and active users are useful information that can help understand member interactions This paper presents a case study of online Free Tibet activities and is an initial attempt toward a framework to analyze Cyberactivism. Two popular Internet media, web sites and forums of Free Tibet activities are identified collected and analyzed. We aim to shed light on the following research questions 1 What automated methods can be used to analyze Cyberactivism 2 What knowledge and insights can we gain through social network and topical analysis of Cyberactivism II F REE T IBET Tibet generally refers to the Tibet Autonomous Region a province-level entity governed by the People's Republic of China \(PRC\. Religion is extremely important to the Tibetans and Tibet is the traditional center of Tibetan Buddhism Panchen Lamas and Dalai Lamas are two well-known spiritual leaders of Tibetans Tibet was first included into China\222s territory in the 1300s At the beginning of the 20th century Tibet and Mongolia signed a treaty proclaiming mutual recognition and their independence from the Republic of China  When the China 
Civil War ended in 1949, Tibet became a part of the PRC. In 1959, PRC armies thwarted the Tibetan resistance movement and Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, fled to India The Central Tibetan Administration \(CTA\also referred to as the Tibetan Government in Exile TGE is headed by the 14th Dalai Lama and claims to be the rightful and legitimate government of Tibet  Free Tibet activities refer to activities that aim to support the independence of Tibet. Most Free Tibet activities are guided by the CTA III R ESEARCH D ESIGN Free Tibet related web sites and forums are the focuses of this case study Such web sites and forums are created and maintained by activists supporters and sympathizers in a variety of languages, including English, Chinese, and Tibetan In this study, we propose different methodologies for analysis of each medium 
Since there are many Free Tibet web sites available, the first step is to identify which ones are important.

2 5 4 254 2 5 5 255 Table.1: Test Results III T HE L IMITATION OF ADDING SECURE DELETION TO FILE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES Using the way of adding secure deletion to file system [7  o r  cryptographic techniques to erase sensitive data is very efficient and useful in many aspects but also has some limitations, here are shortcomings in A and B. So developing secure deletion tools still has a large demand especially in record devices reusable cases A Limitations of Adding secure deletion to file systems The Ext2, Ext3, and Reiserfs file systems support a special per-file attribute to mark files or directories that contain sensitive information and require secure deletion Unfortunately the attribute is different thus difficultly maintained for different OS versions Bauer 2  u s e d  s p e c i a l  per-file attribute setting method and modified unlink  and truncate \(\ operations to Ext2 to erase the data and meta-data Joukov and Zadok 11  d e v e l o p e d  a n  e x t e n s i o n  o f  t h e  f i l e  system which is good to incorporate other file system to implement synchronous or asynchronous data erasure work These approaches have many advantages but still have some shortcomings 1 Need to modify and increase the source code of file system 2\ Data erasing may not completely overwrite 3\ Synchronous and asynchronous data erasing B Cryptographic techniques Cryptographic erasing 5  a p p r o ach m a inly uses either an encrypted file system or encrypted tools The idea is that destroy the encryption key will make encoded data not be accessible without overwriting The advantage of cryptographic techniques is that it has quick erasing speed, but there are a number of deficiencies as follows 1\ Difficulty in key management 2\ Plaintext files may remain visible 3\ Affect system performance IV A F AST DATA ERASING ALGORITHM MODEL A Asynchronous I/O algorithm in Data Erasing system The main drawback of secure deletion tools is that speed is much slow, because it needs to use data to cover the disk sector when you do the overwriting work, so in order to improve the speed and efficiency of erasure, we introduce multi-threading technology base on asynchronous I/O in data erasing system to erase data Our Data Erasing system use the multi-threading technology base on asynchronous I O to erase data for improving speed, because of data erasing system need frequent to write data to disk when it is overwriting threads will be blocked when it is writing data to disk if the data erasing system use synchronous single-threaded to erase data programming instructions can not be executed until the data have been completely written to disk B Core algorithm of data overwrite Although disk drives are often thought of as \221random access\222 devices the fact is that mass storage access is usually more efficient when done in a sequential fashion. Sequential access on a disk drive is relatively efficient because the OS can move the read/write head one track at a time assuming the file appears in sequential blocks on the disk\. This is much faster than accessing one block on the disk, moving the read/ write head to some other track, accessing another block, moving the head again, and so on.  So our data erasing system attempt to read or write large blocks of data or whole disk blocks on each file access rather than reading or writing small amounts more frequently. Reasons as following 1\OS external file system calls are not fast, so if you want the application run twice as fast, you can make half as many calls by reading or writing twice as much data on each access 2\ The OS must read or write whole disk blocks, it cannot transfer partial blocks between the disk and memory.  It bring two advantages first slack space can be overwritten for improving security Second it follows the rules that the OS must read/write whole disk block so improving data erasure speed 


2 5 6 256 3\  We can\222t control the number of the OS file system calls because the number of files is choired by the user. But we can control read/write mode of the file system calls. Windows file system calls read/write approach can be determined by set up read/write flag SDelete software use FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH flag to make system write data to the disk through fast disk cache V T EST R ESULTS OF SECURE DELETION TOOLS We evaluate our system on a P4 3.2GHz machine with 1GB of memory The disk is a 30GB 7200 RPM Western Digital Caviar IDE and formatted with NTFS. The operation system is windows XP sp2 The tested software are Eraser Sdelete Quick Erase. The tested files are set as two types, one is single file that file size increased by the order is 4 MB, 16MB, 32MB, 50MB, 100MB 1GB, the other multi-files in directories that make total file size 100MB The 100MB directory includes 24 subdirectory and 440 files. Every file size is between 1K and 10MB Fig. 1 three-passes overwrite We can see from above Fig. 1 that the distance between the two lines has linear growth with the file size increasing.  If the file has the same size our Quick Erase\222s erasure time is the fastest, Sdelete is the second, and Eraser is the last. For example if the single-file size is 100 MB, our Quick Erase\222s erasure time is 10.12s, the Eraser is 18.32s, so our erasure time is 8s faster than the latter. If the single-file size is 1GB, our erasure time is 96.62s, the Eraser is 172.45s, so our erasure time is 78s faster than the latter Thus we conclude that our Quick Erase\222s erasure time is faster than Eraser twice, and is 33 percents faster than Sdelete VI C ONCLUSIONS This paper comprehensively overviews technologies standards and trends related to data erasure discusses the shortcomings of techniques on adding secure deletion to file system and on cryptographic to prevent deleted data from being accessible Focusing on secure deletion mechanism in the NTFS file system and combining the asynchronous I/O multi-threading technology we develop Quick Erase data erasure software, to erase both the file data and metadata Comparison with the best international secure deletion tools our Quick Erase has much improved the erasure speed The principle of the algorithm shows ability to combine with other effective data erasure methods to form different levels of erasure algorithms that can be applicable to variety of security situations The technology we provide can be used for both good and bad purposes, for good it benefits to the protection of people\222s privacy, of confidential information; for bad is that it would help hacker hide their activities by erasing evidence of criminals and allow them to evade the law more easily Our future work is to extend our Quick Erase algorithm to other file systems and other file types such as complex compression, encryption and sparse files A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research is supported by the NSF of China, the project code 70471064 and the Foundation for National Innovation Base in Philosophy and Social Science, \223985 Project II\224 R EFERENCES 1 N  J o u k o v   E  Z ad o k   A d d i n g  S e c u r e D e l e t i o n  t o  Y o u r  F a v o r i t e  F i l e  System.

 10 data obtained from the industrial motor test setup. Data was acquired using the experimental fault profile in Figure 15. A snapshot of raw data, including the calculated feature values, is provided in Figure 16 Anomaly Detection\227 The particle filter framework was integrated into LabVIEW to evaluate the real-time performance of the anomaly detector during data acquisition. Shown in Figure 17 is a GUI developed in LabVIEW to manage the anomaly detector settings which include the false alarm rate \(type I error\and false alarm threshold \(type II error  Addi t i onal  confi gurat i on settings include the number of particles used by the particle filter, baseline statistics, fault model, and particle filter update / sample time The results from anomaly detector, using the data shown previously in Figure 16, are provided in Figure 18. The green line represents the confidence of detection based on the false alarm rate and the red line represents the alarm, or detection, threshold as defined earlier in Figure 17. The red dot designates the crossing point during which the red health-state light illuminates to indicate an anomaly has occurred 6  C ONCLUSION  This paper presented a particle-filter based anomaly detector capable of detecting the occurre nce of a major fault mode in its incipient stages for a safe ty critical aircraft actuation system. An overview of a ge neric PHM architecture were presented and applied to a particular EMA fault mode based on an internal FMEA study. The fault mode investigated in detail was a turn-to-turn winding insulation short for a brushless DC motor. The primary fault mode was modeled using physics-of-failure mechan isms indicating the primary failure effect, phase current asymmetry. A feature was derived using a Hilbert transform and statistical analysis to quantify the primary failure eff ect. Then, experimental data was acquired to validate the Simulink simulation model Finally, real-time evaluation of the anomaly detector was performed using LabVIEW  Although a specific system, an EMA, was selected as the test-platform with a specific fault mode, the overall PHM architecture can be applied to an entire range of systems and application domains. In fact, similar techniques which allow  Figure 16\227Plots of experimental data \(top computed features \(bottom experimental test setup using LabVIEW  Figure 17\227LabVIEW interface used to define particle filter settings Figure 18\227Plot of anomaly detection confidence \(top and health state indicator \(bottom\the experimental test setup using LabVIEW 


 11 for early fault detection dur ing acceptable performance in the presence of faults are being developed for a wide variety of system in both manned and unmanned air vehicles Therefore, the concept of usi ng system health information diagnosis and prognosis\n conjunction with reconfigurable control is at the forefront of modern space and avionics applications requiring increasingly sophisticated fault-tolerant systems that are robust, reliable and relatively inexpensive. Ther efore the need arises for a fault-tolerant control architecture to further maximize performance and extend the operating life of COTS components in future avionics systems A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was performed under the United States Air Force USAF\contract number FA8650-06-C-7628.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
