SOA and EAÑSustainable Contributions for Increasing Corporate Agility Joachim Schelp University of St Gallen Institute of Information Management CH-9000 St Gallen M  uller-Friedberg-Str 8 Email joachim.schelp@unisg.ch Stephan Aier University of St Gallen Institute of Information Management CH-9000 St Gallen M  uller-Friedberg-Str 8 Email stephan.aier@unisg.ch Abstract  Service oriented architectures SOA have been introduced for various reasons over the previous couple of years Analogous to the introduction of enterprise application 
integration EAI technologies before re-use and cost cutting potentials have been among the most prominent reasons But considering the increasing complexity of an application landscape following the introduction of a SOA the re-use and cost cutting arguments will lead to disappointment However service oriented architectures offer a great potential to increase corporate agility To sustainable preserve corporate agility it is necessary to explicitly manage the enterprise architecture This paper discusses the problems of re-use and cost cutting expectations in service oriented architectures and contrasts them with the potentials related to make sustainable contributions to corporate agility 
Structures processes and instruments to realize these potentials are discussed with reference to selected case studies I I NTRODUCTION Enterprise application integration EAI technologies and later on service oriented architectures SOA have been used by practitioners to meet the complexity problems arising from evolutionarily grown heterogeneous application landscapes in large companies  W ith EAI s rst introduction goals like cost cutting could be met e.g by standardizing interfaces and reducing the number of interfaces Other goals like increasing exibilityÑe.g mentioned in  or by practitioner contributions in not be met The con 
frontation with exaggerated expectations has put EAI into the background However similar expectations are now connected to service oriented architectures as the steady group of participants in the underlying long-term study stated Experiences with EAI are bringing re-use and cost cutting potentials into the foreground Driven by vendors analysts and consultants the expectation is arising again that the introduction of this technology leads to a better adaptation of corporate IS to changing business processes and to a better business process support in general Instead of discussing exibility and a better business-IT alignment in general this contribution offers an agility oriented goal system in which the other goals are positioned Because 
agility is to be realized not only once but continuously in the long run this contribution asks for the structures processes and instruments necessary for a sustainable achievement of these goals Goal system sustainability and resulting requirements are discussed in section II Because only few companies have established the required structures and processes current practices are sketched via selected cases in section III and analyzed regarding sustainability in section IV A summary and an outlook on further research work conclude this contribution in section V The discussion of the goal system and its application to service oriented architectures are based on a literature analysis An explorative case analysis according 
to Yin is made to discuss the required or g anizational structures and processes II C ORPORATE AND IS GOALS Assuming that companies are facing an intensiveÑif not increasingÑcompetition we further presume that increasing corporate agility is an important goal in the companies goal system Additionally we assume that business demands corporate IS to contribute to corporate agility as well which has consequences for the design of the application landscape These assumptions are based on the studies on key issues for IT executives by Luftman et al  and the w orks of 
W eill et al on strate gic alignment and agility 12 13 A Agility Although agility and exibility are often used as synonyms we follow the discussion in production management and understand exibility as one part of agility only E.g Yusuf et al understand agility as the capability to adapt to unexpected changes whereas exibility is focused on expected changes only  In production management e xibility is b uiltin by considering conìgurability in early design stages both for production structures e.g by using highly conìgurable CIM or CAD/CAM systems and products e.g by component based design Conìgurability fosters exibility but it cannot or only very limited contribute to unexpected changes 
because only expected changes could be considered at the design stage Consequently agility is required as a corporate goal in production management 20 Y usuf et al deìne agility as the successful exploration of competitive bases speed exibility innovation proactivity quality and profitability through the integration of reconìgurable resources and best practices in a knowledge-rich environment to provide Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


customer-driven products and services in a fast changing market environment Furthermore in production management the importance of being pro-active is stressed instead of being only reactive to the changing business environment The ve sub-goals of agility as deìned by Yusuf et al serve as the evaluation framework for the subsequent discussion of SOA in section II-C However agility is a goal to be reached not only once but permanently Therefore the following subsections investigate the concept of sustainability B Sustainability An analysis of deìnitions of and approaches to sustainability identiìes environmental economics as the origin of this concept The most cited deìnition can be found in the so called Brundtland report Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability to meet those of the future Other prominent b ut analogous deìnitions exist as well 23 Based on a broad literature review Huber decomposes sustainability into the strategies of efìciency sufìciency and consistency and Gronau added the strategy of participation The strategy of sufìciency asks How much is enough An answer can hardly be found However it seems to be advisable to be modest Sufìciency raises the demand to realize a certain degree of modesty by renunciation The criticism of this strategy reads It is unrealistic and full of false effectsÑthe former because it contradicts the general standard of individual utility maximization It shows false effects because restrictions can lead to economic and social stagnation or at least to undesirable development within these areas The strategy of efìciency focuses on increasing productivity to make economic services proìtable i.e to provide services with minimal use of resources addressing a sub-goal of agility at the same time Central concepts are reuse and longevity From an economic point of view the strategy of efìciency is the most compatible strategy which therefore is often equated with sustainability The strategy of consistency deìnes either the complete isolation of a system from its environment or the enforcement of its consistency between a system and its environment as the design goal  The strategy of participation demands the involvement of concerned stakeholders e.g of a system development project This is required both for an optimal design of a system and to increase acceptance of a system within its user base If sustainability is a relevant topic for a company in the majority of cases reducing negative external effects to its physical and/or social environment are addressed This will be referenced as externally oriented sustainability in the following Furthermore the underlying understanding of sustainability will be detached from ecological aspects Hahn and Hungenberg deìne the main goal of each company as preservation i.e sustainability and successful development in order to meat the individual expectations of all groups interested in the company This internally oriented sustainability deìnes a corporate view on sustainabilityÑaddressing a longterm efìcient corporate leadership and management as the primary corporate goal which contributes to agility as well Aspects of the strategy of consistency can be found within the dimension of organizational architecture It is clear that organizational structures and business processes can not be designed independent from each other because they are different views of the same object A lacking consistency between these views would lead to inefìciency Analogous consistenc y between IS systems is required as well as consistency between organizational and IS architectures supporting them Within the IS department the strategy of efìciency demands for a minimal time and effort to implement changes in IS structures Changes or extensions have to be implemented fast and cost efìcient At the same time complexity is not to be increased more than necessary Is the o v erall corporate system to be changedÑi.e by introducing new technologies like web services or new design paradigms like service orientationÑthe resulting changes have to be reîected in the overall system i.e by new organizational structures rules or management instruments To be compliant with the strategy of sufìciency at the same time requires all necessary changes to be minimal not to be larger than required To master all changes within the organization acceptance by all persons being affected is required leading to their involvement in the transformation process  strategy of participation  Service oriented architectures can contribute to a sustainable increase in corporate agility only if they provide positive contributions to time to market exibility pro-active innovation quality and proìtability as shown in section 2.1 and at the same time being compliant with the strategies of efìciency proìtability consistency consistency of architectures participation involvement of business and IS departments and sufìciency The later demands for all measures within the change and transformation process to meet the goals but not to reverse them by introducing red-tapism C A rst evaluation of SOA How can a SOA contribute to corporate agility According to Yusuf et al the sub-goals of agility as mentioned in section II-A have to be met 1 speed and a better time to market respectively 2 exibility 3 pro-active innovation 4 quality and 5 proìtability The aspect of pro-active innovation is disregarded in this discussion because it is primarily inîuenced by organizational issues less by architecture paradigms As SOA can be implemented with various technologiesÑsee e.g the technologies referenced in  detailed vie w o n technologies w ould be out of scope of this article as well Furthermore this article will not enter the discussion of IS as an enabler Regarding quality modern technologies are enforcing documentation or generation of code and documentation more than they did in the past In addition to this newer infrastructure technologies i.e middleware foster the use of repositories so that manual search for components documents etc is reduced if not avoided Therefore these repositories and enhanced search functions for components and documentation enhance the development process and its quality They positively Proceedings of the

contribute to product quality But due to the use of tools of different vendors best of breed a general conclusion regarding quality is difìcult to make A potential for a positive contribution is given but it depends on the effective combination of the tools employed and their integration to determine the extent at which this potential can be realized Another contribution to agility is offered by SOA by fostering the use of standardized interfaces and harmonizing infrastructure interfaces therefore facilitating the combination of existing services and increasing the exibility of the overall system To use this advantage to its full extent a standardization and harmonization of interfaces is strictly required But even if standardized systems are not available and/or legacy systems are dominating the application landscape a SOA offers advantages in terms of exibility Standardization is facilitated by improving the infrastructure repositories etc offering a better basis for further development with an increased share of standardized interfaces Similarly advantages in terms of speed are unlocked by reducing development time of enterprise services and components not only for new components but for change of existing systems as well We assume that a business department request for IS support has led to the development of an enterprise service consisting of partly existing partly newly developed components basic services Reuse of existing components has increased the development time of this service rst Then we assume that another business department request leads to a change of this service This change request can be implemented in different scenarios In the simplest scenario it is a black box change The service can be changed internally without enforcing changes in dependent services or components We assume that the test efforts will be limited because the tests required relate only those services and components directly connected In this scenario the change can be implemented very fast compared to the full change cycles in previous legacy systems In a second scenario the change request requires a change of at least one interface of one of the dependent services This leads to a higher change effort than in the rst scenario However a SOA offers all advantages of object and component orientation The change can be implemented by simply offering an additional interface via a service variant which has a different signature In this case all services dependent on the older variant do not have to be changed as their interface is still working Other services developed later on and requiring the changed service simply make use of the new service variant The advantages regarding development time compared to development in legacy systems is obvious and there is only a small difference compared to the rst scenario Under good circumstances the development simply requires an additional rule within the integration infrastructure integration bus If additional logic beyond transformation rules is not allowed on the integration bus by policy an explicit variant has to be built This is a realistic scenario in some cases up to six variants of a service are reported to be used in parallel Although the gains in development time and therefore in time to market are obvious there are some problems related to the increasing number of services which is fostered by the introduction of variants In reality reuse of existing services or components is high only for a small number of services however the average reuse rate is very low An impressive example e.g Schwinn and Hagen are gi ving The y h a v e shown that at the time of the study 34 of 650 services have been reused but with an average reuse rate of 1.7 only Especially the low number of services with a high reuse rate 14 services have been reused 10 times or more for the yet positive evaluation of the SOA see is interesting Every additional variant reduces reuse Furthermore every additional variant increases maintenance efforts Therefore the evaluation of a SOA regarding proìtability has to be very cautious especially if the ROI of a SOA project can be determined Another disadvantage is the increasing complexity of the overall system which may haveÑespecially in the long runÑa negative impact on quality time to market exibility pro-active innovation and proìtability And nally different variants of a service facing different reuse by newly developed services may lead to a tightly intermeshed net of dependencies whose complexity is bigger than the legacy system replaced by the service oriented architecture We can conclude that a service oriented architecture can contribute to a higher corporate agility But it is questionable if this is sustainable Especially complexity issues and alignment to business changes seem to require solutions beyond the technical design paradigm Because this is affected by company speciìc factors and may supersede the direct contribution to agility further analysis is done via an explorative case study to determine further relevant success factors III C ASE S TUDIES In the following subsections ve companies are sketched which have built up service oriented architectures several years ago and made experiences with the evolution of these architectures In each case the motivation to introduce a SOA will be presented as well as the architectural levels which are distinguished and the structures which have been chosen to design and run these architectures The architectural levels are outlined because of the diversity of the term service Comparability is provided by translating the individual companies terms into the architectural levels deìned in b usiness architecture organizational architecture covering both business processes and organizational structures integration architecture software architecture and infrastructure architecture The discussion of architecture management processes focusses especially on any alignment between these levels and the involvement of the business side Data for the case studies have been collected with three of these companies since 2002/2003 and with the remaining two since 2005 Key stakeholders in IT management architecture management i.e IS and business architects and Business/IT relationship management have been interviewed In addition to the interviews regular review meetings have been set up to observe state development and architectural issues in the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


companies involved Two of the companies described participated in long term collaborative research projects in IS integration and enterprise architecture involving ten companies in the period of 2002Ö2008 The companies chosen for this study have a long term experience with service oriented architectures and have mature architecture management structures in place With two companies individual research projects on integration and architecture have been done These projects offered the opportunity to contact a broad range of employees and roles to gain additional insight into internal changes in structure state and strategy of both IS and business perspectives Data presented in the case studies below aggregate the research results gained with these companies until spring 2008 Due to company request the case studies have been made anonymous A Company A Company A is one of the major banks in Switzerland In its history mergers had a major impact on the complexity of the application landscape Increasing demand for application integration led to the introduction of a SOA In 2002 the core banking system consisted of more than 450 host based and client server systems To meet the resulting integration complexity a rst SOA vision was developed in 2001 First steps to its implementation have been made by encapsulating existing functionality as business services resp by implementing new functionality as business services The encapsulation of existing functionality increased exibility and implementation time in general could be reduced i.e time to market could be improved Regarding architecture the levels business i.e partly business and organizational architecture application and integration i.e both integration architecture software component i.e both software architecture and technical architecture i.e infrastructure architecture are distinguished All technical architectures are more detailed than the business architecture only a few business models are modeled explicitly modeling of business processes is diverse regarding details scope completeness and timeliness depending on the business departments Architecture management processes are strong regarding the IS department a team of more than 90 architects guarantees architecture communication and enforcement to IS development Architecture processes are clearly deìned in this context and strong architecture governance is established Architecture impact regarding the business departments is less strong although impact and enforcement of architecture is strong regarding individual IS projects However architecture models and processes and resulting transparency within the business departments are not equivalent scope models model granularity and quality of processes are more process driven and coincidental B Company B Company B is one of the biggest power supply companies in Germany Whereas EAI has been understood and operated as a technical project SOA has been taken differently SOA governance issues have been a major concern which has early been addressed Driven by the group IS department governance models have been developed alongside detailed technical models Business owners have been involved early resulting in short SOA based implementation times for new business processes today thus contributing positively to agility However this IS driven SOA initiative has been limited to selected business departments A reason for this may be the lack of any holistic enterprise architecture the architecture team in the IS department is focusing on IS architecture management only and business process management is done for selected business departments only Architectural levels covered are selected business processes i.e organizational architecture business service architecture i.e integration architecture basic service architecture i.e software architecture Analogous to company A the focus has been more on technical architectures whereas business oriented architectures have been rudimentarily covered at best C Company C Company C is a major nancial service provider in Switzerland primarily focusing on standardized retail banking and transaction processing Increasingly complex dependencies between applications within the evolutionary grown application landscape combined with an increasing demand for application integration led to a major EAI project This resulted in a SOA vision to repeat on business side the advantages gained by faster project execution realized reuse and resulting cost efìciency within the IS department Regarding architectural levels all levels mentioned in can be found with broad deìned architecture management processes on IS side to develop and carry on the service oriented architecture An initiative was started to manage business and organizational architecture artifacts by the IS department architecture team as well However this has been dropped in favor of managing all business related artifacts by an explicit business architecture management team itself All business related architecture artifacts are managed by an organizational unit attached directly to the CEO The alignment of business and IS architectures is explicit and facilitated by a personal interweavement by having former IS architects included in the business architecture unit The service oriented application landscape has led to increased reuse and reduction of costs thus contributing to agility The effect of better alignment processes could not be evaluated sufìciently by now because they have not been in production long enough However rst observations indicate a positive contribution D Company D Company D is a major telecommunication service provider in Germany In the context relevant for this paper the telecommunication industry features two special characteristics On the one hand the industry is technology afìne and technology driven On the other hand implementation speed is high regarding both design and implementation of new products e.g new pricing models technological product innovation to be distinguishable from competitors Both characteristics have led to an early start of an enterprise architecture project Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


to deìne a framework for technical change projects This framework has been considered helpful for both identifying the impacts of scheduled change projects and to govern conformance of planned changes regarding deìned architecture rules Additionally special processes have been established to break architecture rules temporarily if both a project plan and a budget are deìned to re-establish architecture conformance These rules have been helpful to gain additional speed advantages thus contributing positively to agility In a technology driven industry like telecommunication the cultural distance between business and IS departments is not as large as it is in other less technology afìne or technology drivenÑindustries To retain this closeness in the long run all change projects have to show a clear business case Due to the stiff competition in the market and the resulting change frequencies even a business case for infrastructure projects like SOA can be shown The enterprise architecture management in this case has clearly deìned structures and processes as well as the governance has The company has architectural layers compatible with  with special importance gi v e n t o a domain model or g a nizational and integration architecture layers being relevant for all change projects E Company E Company E is another telecommunication service provider operating in Germany as a subsidiary of a foreign telecommunication group outside the German-speaking countries Analogous to company D the company and the business departments are technology afìne and the business is technology driven Furthermore the stiff competition deìnes speed to a business goal dominating design adoption and execution of new business models and their supporting applications Just as in company D the application landscape has grown fast over the last couple of years and has reached a high level of complexity In previous years applications have been designed and introduces individually in each country the group is present Later on a centralization initiative was started to align the formerly distributed and non-uniform architecture activities in the different countries Due to a change of corporate strategy the cross-country architecture alignment was revoked Service orientation is a design goal for application development now to tame the ever increasing complexity of the distributed heterogeneous application landscape The understanding of services is compatible to company D with enterprise services deìned on the integration architecture layer and basic services deìned as software components on the software architecture layer However business processes are captured inconsistently hampering the alignment of business and IS architectures with this regard Due to the weak cross-country alignment of architectures within the group the resulting architecture can be described as a federally structured application landscape Within the individual companies the country-speciìc architecture management structures and processes are mixed In the German subsidiary structures and processes are mature architecture competencies are high and the underlying principles of service orientation are well understood Processes structures and rules deìning the governance are clearly deìned too But due to quickly changing corporate strategies and their organizational impact it is difìcult to estimate how these structures and processes can be effective with sustainable results IV A NALYZING THE CASES  CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUSTAINABLE AGILITY The preliminary analyses in section II-C showed that service oriented architectures have the potential to contribute positively to corporate agility In fact in all cases positive effects could be observed after the introduction of service oriented architectures or their underlying design paradigm Improvements in speed could be observed in every company The improvements in the technical infrastructure have led to a better at least technical quality Reuse exibility and proìtability potentials could be realized only in some but not in all cases see table I Furthermore in all cases the complexity of the overall system has grown When considering the long term effects of increasing complexity the positive effects of introducing a SOA may show to be temporary For being sustainable this complexity has to be tamed  Experiences from the case studies outlined gi v e hints on critical success factors Within all companies measures are established to probe the effects mentioned e.g time to market has been measured in terms of reduced project time which is an indicator for exibility in change projects as well Quality improvements could be measured in terms of better documentation related data from repositories Due to varying development process standards and a diverse set of software tools employed the measures are heterogeneous among the companiesÑespecially regarding documentation e.g documentation rate or change rates Because of the unsatisfying situation with diverse measures making the effects only partially comparable we organized the joint workshops within the research projects to have the self-assessments peer reviewed by experts from other companies including those taking part in the individual research projects or in the interview series only These discussions between experts in a controlled setting revealed inconsistencies contradictions and additional insights thus providing a more solid foundation for the analysis In the following the cases are summarized regarding the strategies of consistency participation sufìciency and efìciency as introduced in section II-B Regarding strategy of consistency company A has to be assessed very cautiously The organizational architecture in terms of business processes is not managed at the same extent as it is done for integration software and infrastructure architectures Business departments views are collected via IS projects only Although the imbalance is identiìed from both business and IS departments and rst measures are discussed this issue is not solved in the short run A similar conclusion can be drawn for company B Although governance and interfaces to business process management have been established for SOA projects these measures are Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

available/applicable/observed  preliminary observation limited to single issuesÑthe stabilizing and balancing frame of an enterprise architecture management does not exist By contrast in company C the importance of a consistent modeling and management of models across the different architectural layers is not only identiìed but addressed by explicit architectural units The situation for company D is similar The cultural differences between business and IS departments are limited due to the technology afìne industry and the enterprise architecture management is complete and pragmatic so that a sound base for the deployment of SOA is given analogous company E with focus on Germany although the architectural scopes are limited in comparison with D A similar picture can be drawn regarding the strategy of participation  In company A business department representatives are involved in a limited number and scope only They initiate IS projects but are not involved in the further development of architectures or in the alignment process of business and IS architectural views In company B participation is well developed regarding the IS department driven SOA governance model but is limited regarding selected business departments In contrast to all other cases in company C the participation of business representatives is maximal due to the positioning of the enterprise architecture team on the business side close to the CEO Here the potential for contribution to a sustainable alignment is obvious With limitations this is visible in companies D and E as well as the cultural gap between business and IS departments is smaller and the cooperation of business IS and architectural units is given This is fostered by technological issues being relevant to corporate product development and marketing on the one hand and the requirement to show business cases for every aspect in the IS departments on the other hand Regarding strategy of sufìciency company A has implemented a wide range of measures for architecture management especially architecture communication and enforcement To ensure consistency among all IS related architectural views this is very helpful But these measures may lead to a size of the architectural unit and a level of detail in architecture management processes and structures that might lead to overbureaucracy and limited consistency and alignment in the long run With company B the state of architecture management is not sufìcient enough to anchor service orientation in piloting projects in the overall group In company C sufìciency cannot be evaluated yet because the implemented architecture management structures are not productive long enough With companies D and E with focus on Germany the sufìciency is best because even SOA project have to show a clear and veriìable beneìt for the business Pure SOA projects for architectural purposes do not occur there According to section II-B a positive contribution of SOA to the strategy of efìciency can be assumed This can be conìrmed by the experiences in companies B C D and E Especially in company C efìciency potentials have been realized by reuse Decoupling the systems has led to increased complexity but the systems are more exible and integration is easier now With companies D and E SOA projects have to lead to more efìcient solutions otherwise the constraint to provide business cases would prevent their implementation While SOA is a design paradigm it does not contribute to sustainable agility Those companies where indicators for contributions to sustainable agility could be found showed structures processes and instruments i.e policies measures and metrics that are characteristic features of an explicit enterprise architecture management A complementary study  indicates that especially in enterprise architecture management involving business departments in both structures and processes is a crucial success factor to sustainability The situation at company B illustrates that focusing on the IS perspective is not sufìcient V O UTLOOK As shown before service oriented architectures offer the potential to contribute to an increased corporate agility However not in every case this design paradigm does offer the reuse and cost cutting potentials as claimed by vendors and consultants But it enables companies to react faster with their IS projects to changing change requests by business departments and thus contribute to the overall corporate agility This is complemented by the potential of a higher exibility and reuse of existing components although these potentials only are to be realized in the long run to pay offÑmostly As positive the contribution to corporate agility is as difìcult is the communication task of the IS department cost cutting by reuse is easy to communicate and required infrastructure investments are comparatively easy to achieve but their beneìts can only be reaped in the long run Positive contributions to agility and required infrastructure investments are difìcult to communicate they have to meet an explicit demand of business departments for a better time to market quality innovation capability or exibility which is explicit and strong enough to be endorsed with the necessary will to invest From a research perspective the adoption of SOA in companies shows further research potential beyond the discussions Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


of technical artifacts The cases shown document an increasing inclination of companies to invest in enterprise architecture management to meet the increasing complexity coupled with the introduction of service oriented architectures Most of these activities are focused on IS architectures by now but the requirement to address artifacts within the broad range of enterprise architecture is clearly visible A complementary study in sho ws the emer gence of suitable structures and processes to govern architecture development and enforcement The inclusion of business departments in enterprise architecture activities is a phenomenon showing a broad range of challenges and is very interesting from a research point of view Beyond technical questions especially service orientation requires the construction of appropriate methodologies to foster a sustainable alignment between business and IS departments As mentioned in the introduction of section III the company data especially the measures employed the repository reports used and project documentation standards illustrated that the measurement and evaluation of service oriented architectures is still in its infancy Therefore we started a research project dedicated to the establishment of a proper SOA and EA government framework which requires reformulating the measurement of structures and processes The measures will be derived from the corporate goal system with special emphasis on agility as laid out in section II The resulting metrics will allow statistical testing within the company Within the joint research project the other companies involved will partially apply the resulting measures and metrics allowing both intraorganizational analysis and the derivation of causal models based on a detailed statistical foundation R

I r Z  Figure 9 A Military Modeling and Simulation Configuration of the Ilium Framework To do that we have assembled a collection of trusted military simulations that span the range of such applications from fine-grained simulations that focus on detailed interactions between two entities to coarse-grained simulations of military campaigns Figure 9 illustrates the Ilium Framework configured to accommodate those simulations as well as representative prototype systems In this case the legacy applications are simulations analysis systems and design tools Prototypes are notional UAV autopilots route planners decision support systems and similar applications The Framework augments these applications with control objects and agents that coordinate computations in the composed system and specialize agents that typically represent the characteristics of a new system or technology that cannot be easily or adequately simulated in any of the component legacy systems In our current study the following systems have Ilium Framework plugins and are used as components in the study environment 12 Al f<cOmmi.ain FIa 1A  


THUNDER is a campaign simulation that models national military forces and military operations that extend over months 30  Characteristics of individual systems are evaluated statistically and their effects on the overall campaign are not explicitly known Political social and cultural objects and concepts are not included in the model In this configuration THUNDER is used to generate force level tasking mission orders and to evaluate and adjust for the results of missions with respect to campaign plans SEAS is a force level simulation that simulates battles between major forces in combat operations that typically last for hours and as much as a day SEAS features a flexible rules based decision logic that can influence behavior at both the commander and individual combatant level SEAS executes the missions requested by THUNDER and provides a manageable dynamic context for examining the behavior of prototypes in a range of typical operational situations  31 A dynamic plug-in supports interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components EADSIM is a trusted model of air defense systems that is in particular sensitive to many important design attributes of individual systems In certain modified forms it can reference advanced sensor and engagement decision models In our study configuration EADSIM simulates enemy air defenses in selected e.g significant to our investigation portions of the virtual battle A dynamic plug-in supports system control as well as interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components A prototype aircraft mission planning system plug-in supports virtual real time mission plan creation and updates In particular the system provides automatic route planning for selected platforms that have been assigned missions by THUNDER and that are subsequently executed in simulation in SEAS and EADSIM The Ilium Framework itself provides software agents that are used to model notional or experimental UAV characteristics and behaviors Depending on the objectives of a particular study the Framework may also provide agents that address advanced Command and Control concepts to coordinate the interaction of the various component systems We maintain a semantic consistency among the plugged-in component applications by developing a single operational scenario as initial input for a study and deriving the necessary application configuration data from that source We create an RDF model of the scenario based on the Ilium suite of ontologies that includes political context issues objectives sensitivities etc military context centers of gravity campaign objectives etc geophysical environment military units order of battle unit equipment lists etc command and control assets platforms weapons ISR systems etc Figure 11 below is an excerpt from an operational scenario set in the Southwest U.S depicting a description of an Air Force Wing assigned to a notional Joint Task Force The Wing is based at Bishop Air Base and has six Fighter Squadrons assigned to it Additional detail about each of those squadrons as well as the base is found in the model in this case an rdf:resource  associated with it morg:AirForceWing rdf:ID="USAF_366 Air_Exp Wg dc:creator>Doug Holmes</dc:creator mgeo:basedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB geo:positionedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB_pos morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 390_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_494_Ftr_Sq dc date I 0/20/07</dc date morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_496 Ftr_Sq rdfs:comment>366 AEW F-22 F-15 KC-135 130]</rdfs:comment morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 389_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 391 Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 495_Ftr_Sq rdfs:label>366 Air Expeditionary Wing</rdfs:label morg:AirForceWing ab9 7P.b ii uI1 L L CFigure 11 An RDF model of a notional USAF Wing Figure 12 is another excerpt from the same scenario illustrating a model of a particular Fighter Squadron and one of the F-15E aircraft it operates Figure 10 Legacy Components in the Ilium Framework 13 suka

aircraft Note that these models also have associated SEAS models that contain information peculiar to the SEAS simulation about these entities This information is used to configure SEAS to properly represent these particular entities We are also able to insert objects and information that may be of interest in our study that is not represented in any of the component simulations or other applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to extract data from the scenario to create the input files needed to configure the various applications.[36 SELECT name pos long lat alt vis W1HLERE name rdf:type mast SeasLocation name geo:positionedAt pos pos pos:long long pos pos:lat lat pos pos:alt alt name msim:Visible vis  Figure 13 A typical SPARQL query In a similar fashion SPARQL is used to extract data from the scenario to create the necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

 17 Chris Burton received an Associate degree in electronic systems technology from the Community College of the Air force in 1984 and a BS in Electrical Engineering Technology from Northeastern University in 1983.  Prior to coming to the Georgia Institute of Technology \(GTRI\ in 2003, Chris was a BMEWS Radar hardware manager for the US Air Force and at MITRE and Xontech he was responsible for radar performance analysis of PAVE PAWS, BMEWS and PARCS UHF radar systems Chris is an accomplished radar-systems analyst familiar with all hardware and software aspects of missile-tracking radar systems with special expertise related to radar cueing/acquisition/tracking for ballistic missile defense ionospheric effects on UHF radar calibration and track accuracy, radar-to-radar handover, and the effects of enhanced PRF on radar tracking accuracy.  At GTRI, Chris is responsible for detailed analysis of ground-test and flight-test data and can be credited with improving radar calibration, energy management, track management, and atmospheric-effects compensation of Ballistic Missile Defense System radars   Paul D. Burns received his Bachelor of Science and Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering at Auburn University in 1992 and 1995 respectively. His Master\222s thesis research explored the utilization of cyclostationary statistics for performing phased array blind adaptive beamforming From 1995 to 2000 he was employed at Dynetics, Inc where he performed research and analysis in a wide variety of military radar applications, from air-to-air and air-toground pulse Doppler radar to large-scale, high power aperture ground based phased array radar, including in electronic attack and protection measures. Subsequently, he spent 3 years at MagnaCom, Inc, where he engaged in ballistic missile defense system simulation development and system-level studies for the Ground-based Midcourse defense \(GMD\ system. He joined GTRI in 2003, where he has performed target tracking algorithm research for BMD radar and supplied expertise in radar signal and data processing for the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy Integrated Warfare Systems 2.0 office.  Mr. Burns has written a number of papers in spatio-temporal signal processing, sensor registration and target tracking, and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the Georgia Institute of Technology  


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
