Web Services Monitoring: An Initial Case Study on the Tools Perspective Aimilios Chourmouziadis Centre of Communications and Systems Research University of Surrey Guildford, United Kingdom A.chourmouziadis@surrey.ac.uk George Pavlou Centre of Communications and Systems Research University of Surrey Guildford, United Kingdom G.Pavlou@surrey.ac.uk   Abstract Web Services are an XML-based technology that has been recently viewed as capable of being used for network management. An aspect of WS-based management is monitoring Monitoring is concerned with the collection of management data 
reflecting the status of a manage d system. WS-Based monitoring has to be performed efficiently reducing machine and network resource consumption since in such systems latency, memory and traffic overhead is increased by using XML tags to describe data This is a big challenge that requires sophisticated mechanisms to retrieve data, such as bulk or selective retrieval to be employed One technology suggested to address this goal is the XML Path Language. Still XPath as a filtering tool raised a lot of concerns in the NetConf mailing list, about its scalability. Based on these concerns a parser has been developed by the authors to also 
address data retrieval in network management. This paper is an initial scalability study on these tools to identify potential problems that will need further investigation Keywords: WS, XML, XML Path, Monitoring, Event Reporting I   I NTRODUCTION  The growing use of the eXtensible Markup Language XML\ for data representation along with the development of many XML-based technologies has spurred research in many fields. One such technology is Web Services \(WS\ whose promise for application integration interoperability etc. has lead researchers to consider it for network management 
An aspect of using WS for network management is monitoring. Monitoring usually involves retrieving data from a managed system by requesting for it and receiving the response on the same channel the request was sent from \(pull synchronous invocation style For WS-based monitoring an efficient way to retrieve management data is required. This is important since management data represented in verbose XML documents and tags, increase network resource overhead of WS-based management operations.  Therefore tools to process construct or manipulate XML documents are re quired so as to be able to extract data efficiently and reduce the extra overhead 
Two of the industrys options for processing and querying XML documents are the XML Path \(XPath\ Language v. 1.0 1 a n d 2  0  2    T h o ugh t h e s e t w o to o l s we r e  no t d e ve lo p e d implicitly for network management information retrieval, they can still be used to address this domain Network management operations though, require keeping resource usage, latency and traffic overhead low.  Therefore tools that may take into account the network management goals could also be developed One such tool is a parser developed and presented by the authors in T h e pars er i s  built on Javas regular expression engine, allowing extraction 
of management data using queries to perform bulk and selective operations on WS interfaces exposing these data This paper is an initlal scalability study of the perfomance of these tools to identify potential problems needing further investigation The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In section II, some details of the tools whose latency performance we will be assessing for WS-based monitoring are going to be provided.  Section III analyzes a management information retrieval scenario of a QoS-enabled Traffic Engineered \(TE\etwork based on which these three technologies would be compared upon. Section IV explains the queries that need to be performed with each tool for the 
previous scenario. In Section V an inital comparison of these three tools in terms of latency is presented to identify potential tools problems. Finally, section VI presents our conclusions II  I NFORMATION R ETRIEVAL T OOLS  A  XPath 1.0 XPath version 1.0 [1 an d 2 0 [2  a r e W 3 C  can di dat e  recommendations in 1999 and 2005. They took their name from the path notation syntax with slashes \(/\ they use to control the selection of specific portions of an XML document As already implied, XPaths 1.0 main use is to locate elements in an XML document. A secondary use of it is to perform operations on data \(Numeric, String, Boolean 
XPath 1.0 is a subset of its successor and has limited capabilities compared to v2. XPath 1.0 is not a programming language and has to be embedded in a host language to be used Some of the shortcomings of XPath1 compared to its predecessor are: \(a\ a limited number of supported functions b\ry simple data model \(c\t taking advantage of processors data-typing capabilities and \(e\ has simple validation and error management capabilities 827 978-1-4244-2066-7/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 


The most important shortcoming of XPath1 compared to its predecessor though is expressiveness. This allows the latter to form more flexible queries and thus search an XML document to find specific nodes more effectively. Though XPaths2 functionality has increased, so has its memory requirements Due to its size and complexity, XPath 2.0 may require more long term memory than XPath1 XPath 1 and 2 though include more than enough, and even more than required, functionality to be able to address the WSbased management requirements for monitoring. Still the luck of functionality and expressiveness of XPath 1.0 on one side and the heavier memory requirements and complexity XPath 2 has on the other side may have an impact on latency, traffic and memory footprint. This paper is an initial performance study of these tools on latency, to identify potential problems that may opt us to perform further investigations B  Custom based Tool The development of a custom based tool for retrieving management data could in theory address management goals.more efficiently Since efficient retrieval for monitoring at the SOAP level is not an option as more data than required would have to be retrieved, en coded, processed or filtered and since depending heavily on XML parser for data processing may be a heavy solution for management tasks as large documents may need to be searched or loaded into memory the parser in w a s dev e l opped t o a o r k in t h e appl i cat ion  level \(b\ process raw data for selective or bulk retrieval \(c\ use an XML parser to only send response to queries in XML format over SOAP.

Currently QoS is provided on the basis of Service Level Agreements \(SLAs\hese are a set of terms that clients and service providers have to respect when using or providing a service.  The technical part of an SLA is a Service Level Specification \(SLS and it represents the means to quantify QoS services [5  I P Dif f e r e ntiated Ser v ices  4   DiffServ\ is considered as th e most prominent framework for providing QoS-based services and one of the means to support it is over Multi-Protocol Label Switching \(MPLS\ networks Monitoring of the network status and its resources is an essential process so as to ensure that a QoS networks operation will not be compromised. To guarantee the latter Traffic Engineering \(TE\ed. TE requires suitable scalable monitoring systems for the collection of various data in order to ensure the networks smooth operation. This constitutes a significant challenge in QoS-enabled networks B  Data Retrieval for QoS Management with each tool Previous examples of research in monitoring has been performed in the TEQUILA h e CA DEN U S 7], an d t h e  ENTHRONE frameworks [8  A l l th e s e  f r am ew o r k s r e ly  o n  their monitoring systems that capture their network state in order to offer QoS guarantees to their clients. The monitoring systems used for data collection in these frameworks are mostly based on the Manager-Agent paradigm In the scenario we will presen t later on, measurements at the LSP, or SLS level have to be performed. For this reason we have selected two of SNMPs MPLS MIBs to represent management data. These are the MPLS Label Switching Router \(LSR d t h e MP L S  For w ardi n g Equ i v a lence Class to Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry \(FEC-To-NHLFE  T h e f o r m er MIB is  u s ed t o perf or m PHB a n d LS P  measurements and the latter for SLS measurements Having the MPLS MIBs as the management data source WS equivalent interfaces exposing the same management data were built and deployed for all tools. Both the custom parser and XPath are designed to be used as side tools by WSs exposing management data For XPath 1.and 2 each WS allows three views to its data by maintaining them in XML documents. The views are: \(a\ a single instance data view \(b\a multiple-instance data view \(c both single and multiple instance data view. The process to retrieve data with XPath 1&2 is based on the manager-agent paradigm. The manager after selecting the appropriate method depending on the view of the data it wants to have, sends a number of XPath queries to the agent. At the agent, the WS method that is accessed by the manager extracts all the XPath queries and uses its XPath instance to analyze them and access the XML documents data it has view upon. After the required data are selected the agent sends the response to the manager in an XML document format For the custom based tool each WS allows three views to its raw data \(a\imple structures view \(b\plex structures view \(c\ all data view. The process to retrieve data with the custom based parser is similar to XPath and is also based on the manager agent paradigm. The only main difference in this case is that the custom based pa rser processes raw data.  For all three tools, bulk and selective retrieval is supported by queries that are interpreted by the instances of each tool used in each WS C  Information Retrieval Scenario In the management scenario we will be using in section V to identify potential problems that will need further investigation for each tool, we assume that the interface of a router of an MPLS network providing QoS-based services fails. When this occurs the manager is notified of this event On receiving this event the manager performs queries so as to find out the LSPs and SLSs affected by the failing interface and take appropriate actions IV  S CENARIO Q UERIES  For an entity like a manager to determine with any tool the affected LSPs and SLSs for the scenario in the previous sections three queries must be sent to the entity hosting the management information such as an agent. These queries sent from the manager to the agent supervising the router whose 828 


interface failed perform the following: \(a Determine the interface indices of the LSPs associated with the failing interface, \(b these indices to determine the affected LSPs \(c Determine the affected SLSs using the LSP IDs from step b. The relevant queries for XPath 2&1 and the parser are given in Figs 1, 2 and 3 respectively A  XPath 1.0 and 2.0 queries In XPath the most common perception that people have about an XML document is that of a tree of nodes. There are various types of nodes and they share various types of relationships More details are given in Selecting nodes in XPath is performed with a series of path expressions most common of which are given in Table 1.These expressions are used to navigate the nodes and the relationships they share.  Looking at the scenario XPath 2&1 queries in Figs 1&2 respectively, it can be seen that XPath1 queries are more verbose than their XPath2 counterparts. This occurs, because though XPath 1.0 has most mathematical and logical operators, XPat h 2 is richer in logical expressions and functions. This allows the latter to be more expressive. For example though XPath1 allows expressions such as \(a|b|c\/d/e making use of parentheses for grouping operations, it does not allow expressions such as /a/b/\(c |d | e\ath 2.0 supports parentheses usage anywhere in the path expression and allows us to perform sufficiently less filtering operations \(operator   d search t h e docum e n t  m o re eff ecti v el y  f o r m e r g i n g operations \(operator |\ in addition to less verbose queries Fig 1&2\. This may mean performance penalties for XPath1 TABLE 1 Path expression in XPath for selecting nodes  Nodename Selects all nodes after this node  Selects nodes having as start point root node  Selects nodes from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are  Selects the current node  Select the parent of the current node  Selects attributes from a node  Selects any element node   F i n d a no d e t h at con t ai n s a sp eci f i c val u e    Fig. 1 XPath 2.0 queries B  Custom based Parser The custom based parser in a s bu i l t t o su pport bu l k  and selective retrieval from WSs that expose management Fig. 2 XPath 1.0 QoS scenario queries data. Thus, the parser was built to allow the user to select the WS\(s\ to retrieve data from and also to define specific data to retrieve from each WS. This is supported by appropriate qu qu er y  h a s a special f u n c tio n a lit y  T h ere are  four types of queries each of which is use to retrieve specific data from different data structures. More details are given in 3 The fact that there are only 4 types of queries and a small number of operators supported by the parser means that the latter has less functi onality and can not be as expressive as XPath 1&2. On the other hand limiting functionality can help keep the grammar of the parser simpler, less verbose, easier to learn and keep latency consumption overhead low Examples of the custom parser queries equivalent to their XPath counterparts in Fig 1&.2 are given in Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Custom based parser queries  Comparing the queries in Figs 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the row identifiers of each SNMP table row entry are also retrieved with each query. Using the custom parser this is performed by default since the SNMP information model mandates this so as to be able to distinguish table row entries This increases latency overhead and thus it is also performed for XPath implementations to keep things for measurements on the same terms.  All querie s allow us to check the latency overhead performance of each tool for performing merging bulk retrieval\ and filtering operations of varied complexity V  E VALUATION  A  System Setup for measurements For the evaluation aspects of our scenario the MPLS LSR and FEC-to-NHLFE MIBs are exposed as WS interfaces.. The Apache Axis 1.4 SOAP toolkit is used to deploy WS interfaces using a Document/literal encoding style. For XPath 829 


1.0 functionality JAXP 1.3 is used. XPath 2.0 is supported by SAXON 8.9. Javas 1.5.6 regex engine is used for the parser Both XPath implementations come from respected bodies are very mature and fully conformant to standards. To our knowledge there are no other java based or different language based tools that meet all these requirements.  Latency measurements were performed using Javas currentTimeMillis\(\ function by averaging on 10 samples. The manager and agent were deployed on a 1000MHz/256MB RAM and 466MHz/192MB RAM machine respectively, thus simulating a lower end system for the agent. Both machines ran Red-hat Linux 7.3 B  Measurements The measurements we will analyze in this section involve traffic overhead for the QoSbased scenario presented in section III-C to identify if there can be potential scalability problems with any of the used tools which will signify whether a deeper investigation needs to be performed For assessing each tool performance for our QoS scenario the ingress router is configured to have 30 LSPs to simulate a small QoS network each of which is assigned to a different customer. The reason behind assi gning a different customer to each LSP is to keep things si mple with respect to validity checks on the data returned after a query. A further assumption in this experiment is the number of LSPs & SLSs affected by the failing interface, which is six. This seems like a plausible number for small networks although an optimal number is difficult to identify. This main reason behind this selection though is to use a plausible number of   filtering operations in each tool query to check for potential issues  Parser_Query1_30LSPs Parser_Query2_30LSPs Parser_Query3_30LSPs Parser_Total_30LSPs XPath1.0_Query2_30LSPs XPath1.0_Query1_30LSPs XPath1.0_Query3_30LSPs XPath1.0_Total_30LSPs XPath2.0_Query1_30LSPs XPath2.0_Query2_30LSPs XPath2.0_Query3_30LSPs XPath2.0_Total_30LSPs 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 Measurement Type Latency \(ms  Fig. 4 Latency overhead for a small QoS network  From figure 4 it can be seen that the custom parser we have developed performs better than XPath 1&2 even for a small network where a small number of data needs to be processed. XPath 2.0 and 1.0 produce 116% and 166% times respectively more latency than the custom parser Additionally since the operations for the queries that are performed involve a varied number of filtering and merging operations \(bulk\ we  can detect that while the custom parser is relatively unaffected by this, both XPath implementations performance is affected when the number of merging and filtering operations varies. Lastly it is also evident from the queries in Figs 1 & 2 that XPath 2 expressiveness allows it to perform less filtering queries and at the same time perform merging operations better which is evident from the latency improvement on all queries compared to XPath 1 VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper we have shown that W3C mature and fully conformant to standards XPath implementations present potential scalability problems in terms of latency compared to the custom parser for accessing a small networks management data. As such we consider that there is a lot of ground to investigate on many other issues. One such issue is how these tools perform compared to an increasing data volume size. It is also worth considering finding the potential root of this scalability problem and possible solutions to alleviate it. Moreover it is necessary to check if the latency scalability problem is applicable to memory and traffic overhead as well  Furthermore acceptance, grammar simplicity and verboseness, development time and expressiveness are also things that need to be considered under the scope of such an investigation Nevertheless although this is an initial study it has shown that there are potential problems with XPath implementations when these tools are used for mo nitoring and these issues need to be investigated. We have also shown that custom implementations and in general tools built to fit management objectives may also have some application potential, since management tasks require from tools used to address management objectives, to balance between what is required to support functionality, expressiveness and performance A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research work in this paper was partly supported by the IST EU EMANICS and the IST ENTHRONE phase 2 projects  R EFERENCES  1  J.

In PE 3, muxes “s1” and “s2 Figure 4 select computation of either 8x16 or 16x8 motion ve ctors Thereafter, demuxes “s3” and “s4” direct 8x16 or 16 x8 SADs to their corresponding comparators and registers Then  16x16 SAD is computed from either 8x16 or 16x8 SADs. Now we will discuss the routing patterns for different search a lgorithms 4.4  Fast Search Algorithms and Case Study Fast search algorithms like diamond, hexagon, big h exagon and spiral have been introduced to reduce the computati on complexity of motion estimation by operating on red uced number of reference blocks Number of reference blo cks for diamond and hexagon searches are shown in figures 6  and 11 Diamond search requires 9+5n+4 reference blocks  17  a n d  hexagon search requires 7+3n+4 18  r e f e r e n c e  b l o cks where  n is the number of execution iterations Diamond Search As shown in figure 6, pattern consists of nine candidate search points reference blocks in first  iteration Numbers in this figure represent the order of proce ssing the reference frames Directed edges are labeled with d ata transmission equations derived for diamond search p attern based on the data dependencies The grid co-ordinates fol lowed for data transfer is shown in fig 9. An equation is rep resented with nx\ and \(+/-ny\ where \(+ or -\ denotes the dire ction of data transfer on the x and y axis and n denotes the numb er of hops in that direction. Also, load indicates that reference block is loaded from the main memory We now explain SAD computation using diamond search  pattern for a 16 x 16 current block on the proposed architecture Figure 5 represents the current frame which is divi ded into blocks of size 4 x 4.  Sixteen 4x4 current blocks 5 3, 54, 55, 56 65 66 67 68 77 78 79 80 89 90 91 92 are loaded into CPE  \(1,1\, CPE  \(1,2\, CPE  \(1,3\, CPE  \(1,4\, CPE 2,1\, CPE 2,2 CPE  2,3 CPE  2,4 CPE  3,1 CPE  3 2 CPE 3,3\, CPE  \(3,4\, CPE  \(4,1\, CPE  \(4,2\, CPE  \(4 3\, CPE  \(4,4 respectively Each PE1 of the CPEs with a current b lock processes SAD on 9 reference blocks. PE1 \(1,1\ comp utes SAD for current block 53 against reference blocks 29 40’, 42’, 55 53’, 51’, 64’, 66’, 77 Figure 7 shows data dependencies and data transfer patterns for PE1\(1,1 and PE1\(1,3 Solid squares represent inte rsecting search points between the two and solid circles rep resent the other search points Table 1 shows the reference bl ock to be loaded in PE1s at different clock cycles. At clock cycle one, first search points \(reference blocks P 1 1 and P 3 1 are loaded into both processing elements from main memory through MI Fo r this NIs of CPE\(1,1 and CPE\(1,3 set  respective  data_load_control  signals to high indicating the CPE ids and “reference_block_id” output  to 1 indicating th e index of the search point on the diamond pattern \(figure 7\. Bas ed on these inputs and address of the current frames MI genera tes the addresses of the reference frames as per the search  pattern and outputs it to the main memory Main memory then se nds the requested data through corresponding “CPE” input po rts. In this case first reference blocks for PE1\(1,1 and PE1\(1 3 are 29 and 31’ respectively. Figure 7 shows that third sea rch point \(P 1 3  required by PE1\(1,1 is same as second search point  P 3 2  of PE1\(1,3 At clock cycle three P 3 2 is transmitted from PE1\(1,3\’s router to PE1\(1,1 The NI of PE1\(1,3 p acketizes the reference block according to data transmission equation Figure 6 Equation 1x+1y arrow labeled from poi nt 1 to 2 and sends the packets to the router The router of PE1\(1,2 receives the packets, decodes the header packet and following xy routing scheme forwards the packets to the route r of PE1\(1,1 PE1\(1,1 is the destination node hence it s NI depacketizes the data to be processed within its PE 1 Same events take place at cycles 5, 6 and 8 as shown in Figure 8.  The events illustrated with Figure 8 take place for all  sixteen 4x4 current blocks. The above data transfer pattern als o dictates that at every clock cycle, every CPE is accessing a uniq ue reference block. So, at no time slot, two CPEs compete for th e same data and there is no case of resource conflict For every successive iteration, nine SADs are compu ted in each PE1 If the computed SAD minima is located at one o f the vertices  1,4,6 and 9 or edges 2,3,7,8  of the  diamond Figure 6\ , a new diamond pattern is formed with t he minima as the new center for the next iteration This again r equires computation of SADs for next nine reference frames in the same order as in figure 7. But in this case, minima at t he vertex leads to only 5 new reference frames and the minima at th e edges lead to only 3 new reference frames for one iteration I n the last iteration, the minima is the center point \(5\. In t hat case, a small diamond is formed around the minima with 4 referenc e frames The order of reference frames for loading the data for this case and the data transmission equations are shown in fi gure 10. Data transmission equations for hexagon big hexagon and  spiral search patterns are shown in figure 11. The spiral search is more compute-intensive compared to other fast search pat terns The width of the spiral search determines the number of  reference frames to be compared In this example we carry ou t a 5x5 spiral search as shown in figure 11\(c So the num ber of reference frames is 25 Full Search Now we illustrate the functionality of the proposed architecture for full search. Table 2 show s data load schedule  for PE1\(1,1 As shown in table 2\(a at cycle on e four pixels of 4x4 current block are loaded into CP R registers 1 2, 3, 4 through current_data_\(1,1\ port. At cycle t wo, these four pixels are shifted to CPR registers 5, 6, 7, 8 and next four pixels are loaded into CPR registers 1 2 3 4 This cont inues for 4 cycles till a 4x4 current block is completely loade d into PE 1\(1,1\ as shown in table 2\(b\. Similarly, a 4x4 ref erence block is loaded into RPR registers of PE 1\(1,1 in four cycl es through reference_data_\(1,1 port All the PE1s are loaded with corresponding current and reference blocks in a sim ilar fashion At the end of the fifth clock cycle, 4x4 SADs are c omputed and sent to PE 2\(1 Table 3 Control signals to PE 2 1 select between computation of 4x8 SAD or 8x4 SAD at the en d of sixth cycle. At the end of seventh cycle, 8x8 SAD i s computed Similarly, four 8x8 SADs are then sent to PE 3. In PE 3, control signals select between computation of 8x16 SAD or 1 6x8 SAD 


                                         at the end of eighth cycle. At the end of ninth cyc le, 16x16 SAD  is computed \(Table 4\. Now, we present the performa nce results of our architecture and compare it with the ASIC ba sed approach [9   5  RESULTS Proposed architecture was designed with Verilog-HDL  description and synthesized by 90 nm CMOS standard cell library. Design contains about 82K gates.

Rest of the computations in our architecture and [9  a r e  p i p e l i ned. Thus, [9  requires 265 cycles to produce a 16x16 motion vecto r for full search while our architecture requires 266 cycles Table 6 shows the minimum clock rate that is required to sustain 30fps and 60fps frame rates by the proposed architecture and its counterpart 9   A s  s h o w n  i n  t a b l e  6   f o r  Q C I F  f o r m at ASIC approach [9  n e e d s  t o  o p e r a t e  a t  0  7 6  M H z  t o  s u s t a i n the 30fps requirement, whereas our design needs a little fast er clock. This is because the number of cycles required to compute  16x16 motion vector is larger in our design 266 cycles  vs 9  2 6 5  cycles\.  For clock rates slower than 0.8 MHz, our design won’t be able to sustain 30fps  As shown in table 6 for  all frame sizes, our clock rate is comparable with [9   A s  e x pected, while the frame size gets larger the clock rate needs to  increase to respond to the more number of computations with the 30fps or 60 fps constraint Fewer number of search points for fast search algor ithms overcomes the “router” cycles overhead and requires even lesser number of cycles than full search Router’s critica l path consumes 6 cycles. Total data transmission cycles a re the sum of router cycles and total number of hops. Since avera ge number of hops for fast search patterns is 2, the routing cyc le’s overhead is 8 cycles per search point. Also, worst case number of reference blocks accounts from n=4 and best case comes from n 0 on a 32x32 search region.

routing overhead diamond search takes 104 cycles a nd 264 cycles for best case and worst case scenarios respe ctively which is less than 266 cycles of full search Similarly the worst case and best case number of search points are 23 and 11  for hexagonal search and thus it takes 184 and 88 cycle s respectively to produce a 16x16 motion vector. The worst case and best case number of search points are 33 and 21  for big hexagonal search and thus it takes 264 and 168 cycl es respectively to produce a 16x16 motion vector Also  the number of search points is constant for all the cas es of a spiral search For a 5x5 spiral search Figure 11\(c the  number of search points is 25 and thus it takes 200 cycles to  produce a 16x16 motion vector  Therefore architecture suppo rts fast search algorithms with operational frequencies less than the full search algorithm table 6 as shown in Table 7 For  QCIF format our architecture operates at 0.8MHz for ful l search Whereas as shown in Table 7 for DS HS BHS and S S it operates at 0.78 0.55 0.78 0.59 MHz correspondin gly for worst case scenarios. Since the number of search po ints for fast search types decrease significantly our architectu re can now operate at a slower clock rate even for the worst c ase scenarios to sustain the 30fps Further this pattern is obse rvable for all frame sizes Thus, the clock rate of the proposed architecture i s comparable to ASIC implementation for both full search and fas t search algorithms with much lesser resources. Therefore, t he frame size and frame rate supported by the circuit can be subs tantially extended subject to this clock rate constraint for high definition 6  CONCLUSION This paper proposed a new application specific reco nfigurable hybrid coarse-grained architecture with intelligent NoC scheme Existing coarse-grained architectures have generic processing elements and routing structure and therefore suffer  in performance and resource utilization for motion est imation algorithm as compared to our architecture. The inte lligent NoC scheme in our architecture supports VBSME for diffe rent types of fast search patterns like diamond search hexago nal search etc Hybrid grained processing elements support var iable block sizes in motion estimation. Simplicity and highly p arallel nature of the architecture with an excellent degree of dat a reuse makes our design suitable for run time reconfiguration A rchitecture can easily be configured to run any fast search or full search algorithm with block size variations to respond to the video quality and/or timing constraints Our 2D architect ure supports huge reuse of search data between processing elemen ts and thus reduces the memory transaction requirement which is missing in existing state of the art approaches Proposed arch itecture uses hybrid grained processing elements to compute 4x8 o r 8x4 and 8x16 or 16x8 motion vectors dynamically depending o n the control signals supplied. Our architecture is highl y flexible as it supports any block size for any search type which i s a challenging problem from ASIC perspective 7  REFERENCES 1  T. Wiegand, G. J. Sullivan, G.

departments on average\ignificant differences were found regarding the age of the applications. The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\. This supports the proposition \(P3.1\ that more interdependent applications also incur higher IT \(operations and maintenance\ts  Impacts of diversity-related AA complexity   Regarding OS-related diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 5\howed no significant difference between the operations costs of more \(Md=93,890 n=105\d less diverse applications \(Md=131,540 n=27\09.5, z=-1.174, p=.24. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007. Hence, the proposition \(P3.4\at applications with a greater degree of overlap also exhibit higher IT costs is not supported  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 12

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
