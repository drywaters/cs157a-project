COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS AND SEMANTIC DATA VISUALIZATION Sumalatha.M.R, Abishek Ravi, Aravind.M, Prasanna.N Department of Information Technology Madras Institute of Technology, Anna University, Chromepet, Chennai-44 E-mail rsumalatha@yahoo.com   Abstract  In the era of monumental development in all spheres of technology, the repository of huge amounts of raw data is but a necessity. Also with increasing availability of storage space, this factor is not a big problem. Hence instead of tackling issues related to reducing the amount of data to be stored, there is bigger need to implement the creation of a knowledge base and hence create semantic data visualization The work discussed presents an approach to integrate expert knowledge all along the data mining process in a coherent and uniform manner. A collective intelligence system plays a central role in this approach. The work primarily aims at converting the presence of large amounts of raw source data into a knowledge base and collective framework Heterogeneous web sources have been taken into consideration, which act as containers for the raw data source. Data visualization is the second major functionality Taking into consideration the patterns mined, the onus is on the developer to present the mined patterns in a format that is most appealing to the end-user. Creation of such data visualizations requires various dimensions of the pattern to be understood. The estimated end product creates visualization from the knowledge base created from heterogeneous web sources  KEY WORDS  Collective Intelligence, Apriori, Clusters, Semantic Visualization, Ontology  1 INTRODUCTION Collective intelligence is a form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition of many individuals  Knowledge that can be derived from a domain of various voting systems has the capacity for many individual unique perspectives to combine and converge. This convergence can be based on an assumption that the voting systems in use are uninformed. These systems are random to an extent. Knowledge can be obtained by filtering patterns from a decision based process which results in a well informed consensus. Ontology is then framed from this existing knowledge framework and is used as a structure in artificial   intelligence functions. Semantic data visualization and collective intelligence form the heart of the project A Collective Intelligence Information System consists of Instances Instances are the basic, "ground level" components of the system. Strictly speaking, the system need not include any instances, but one of the general purposes of ontology is to provide a means of classifying individuals, even if those individuals are not explicitly part of the ontology  Classes Ontology varies on whether classes can contain other classes, whether a class can belong to itself, or whether there is a universal class  Properties Objects in the ontology can be described by assigning values to their properties. Each property has at least a name and a value, and is used to store information that is specific to the object it is attached to  Relations An important use of attributes is to describe the relationships between objects in the ontology. Typically a relation is a property whose value is another object in the ontology  Events Events in a system play an important role in describing the nature, timing and effects of interaction between various objects Knowledge discovery from data is a process that aims to extract potentially useful knowledge hidden in large data sets However, it remains a crucial issue to elicit relevant models according domain expert knowledge. The KEOPS approach is based on a method which refers to expert knowledge all along a knowledge extraction process. Furthermore, KEOPS uses a part-way interestingness measure between objective and subjective measure in order to evaluate models relevance according to expert knowledge  The work has been proposed by Laurent Brisson and Martine Collar   It is more accurate to state that the approach has parameters that must  be tuned. When surveying the literature on this topic, it was noted that while there are many techniques for automatically tuning parameters, many of these techniques themselves have parameters, possibly resulting in an infinite regression. An additional problem of parameter-laden algorithms is that they make it difficult to reproduce published experimental results and to understand the contribution of a proposed algorithm These perils of parameter laden algorithms have been proposed by Eamonn Keogh  T h e s e pe r i l s  ha v e be e n de a l t  with accordingly in the proposed system of work

The proposed work aims at creating a knowledge base across heterogeneous web sources. The base hence created will perform the functions of a Recommendation System  Given a system of heterogeneous web sources the work first creates a knowledge base by mapping various datasets distributed geographically and reduces the sets to gain relevant patterns. Based on the association rules gathered from patterns a recommendation system is created. Finally the knowledge gathered from patterns is presented to the end user after implementation of the data visualization module. A method used to conserve bandwidth is the Compression Based Dissimilarity model. The dissimilarity model is described as follows Given two strings x and y the Compression based Dissimilarity Model is defined as follows CDM\(x, y\    C \(xy\ \(C\(x\ C\(y When two strings x and y are not related the CDM value is close to 1 and smaller than 1 by a larger value when x and y are related. But it is to be noted that CDM\(x, x\ is not zero  2. THE COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM 2.1 Implementation Issues For highly complex data with mutual relationships, the derived patterns tend to be complex. Thus implementation challenges are as follows  1. The patterns described by the existing knowledge extraction algorithms are still too abstract for general understanding. A pattern that is misinterpreted is of great danger. For example many algorithms do not distinguish between causality and cooccurrence. For an application that aims at finding the reason for a certain type of disease, there is a great difference between finding the origin of the disease and finding just an additional symptom. Developing systems which derive understandable patterns and making already derived patterns understandable is a challenge 2. As stated, current algorithms focus on a limited set of standard patterns. Deriving these patterns often does not yield a direct and complete solution to many problems Furthermore, with an increasing complexity of the analyzed data, it is likely that the derived patterns will increase in complexity as well. Thus, the challenge lies in finding richer patterns 3. The final challenge arises when working with future patterns due to the increased number of valid patterns Therefore, the number of potentially valid patterns will be too large to be handled by a human user, without a system organizing the results. Hence future systems deal with providing a platform for pattern exploration where users can browse for knowledge on a personalized basis 4 Storing Frequent Item-sets using tries is another major issue. In existing algorithms frequent item-sets that are not needed by the algorithm can be written to the disk, and memory can be freed. Frequent items of size y 001 only are needed for the candidate generation of  y\001 0011  item-sets, and later they are not used. Hence there is need for memory conservation  To conclude, systems should generate a large variety of well understandable patterns. Due to variations in the parameterizations, the number of possibly meaningful and useful patterns will dramatically increase and thus, an important aspect is managing and visualizing these patterns    Figure 2.1: Class Diagram for Implementation Issues  2.2 Overview of the proposed Collective Intelligence Architecture In the knowledge extraction and data visualization framework several sub modules like, implementation of distributed web sources, pattern mining in the compressed knowledge base, implementation of compression algorithms and creation of data visualization exist  2.2.1 Implementation of distributed web sources  Distributed web sources provide the user an advantage of having to distribute data geographically. Apart from data, even processes are distributed geographically thereby, making the execution process faster and easier from the resource requirement point of view. Hadoop distributed file system \(HDFS\ clusters are used to create heterogeneous web sources 2.2.2 Pattern mining in the compressed knowledge base  Form the compressed knowledge base that contains various related item sets from the given dataset, various patterns have to be extracted and irrelevant patterns have to be pruned. Various queries with and without parameters have be executed to implement this module. Parameter-light algorithms tend to produce results of higher accuracy 2.2.3 Implementation of compression algorithms  In order to conserve the bandwidth and relax certain other constraints the compression is implemented using runlength encoding. From here the dissimilarity and similarity measures are calculated

2.2.4 Implementation of trie-based apriori approach Once the trie data structure is constructed as per requirements the dataset and knowledge base are processed. Frequent items sets are scanned to generate various patterns. A recommendation system is created based on the Pearson and Euclidean mathematical models 2.2.5 Creation of data visualization The result set is parsed and an intermediate representation in the form of graphs and charts is created. The intermediate result is translated to a visualization structure. The visualization structure is classified based on recommendations created  3 System Architecture HDFS has master/slave architecture. An HDFS cluster consists of a single Namenode a master server that manages the file system namespace and regulates access to files by clients. In addition, there are a number of Datanodes  usually one per node in the cluster, which manage storage attached to the nodes that they run on. HDFS exposes a file system namespace and allows user data to be stored in files Internally, a file is split into one or more blocks and these blocks are stored in a set of Datanodes. The Namenode executes file system namespace operations like opening closing, and renaming files and directories. It also determines the mapping of blocks to Datanodes. The Datanodes are responsible for serving read and write requests from the file system’s clients. The Datanodes also perform block creation deletion, and replication upon instruction from the Namenode  Hence is a brief description of system architecture. The same architecture will be deployed later with respect to an application which will bring out practical and commercial purposes involved in implementing the work proposed. The architecture helps in distributing processes across a group of systems NAME NODE METADATA CLIENT REPLICATION BLOCK DATA NODES BLACK OPERATIONS READ METADATA OPERATIONS WRITE RACK 1 RACK 2 CLIENT NAME NODE METADATA CLIENT REPLICATION BLOCK DATA NODES BLACK OPERATIONS READ METADATA OPERATIONS WRITE RACK 1 RACK 2 CLIENT  Figure 3.1:  System architecture 4 Real Time Analysis and Application e-Business \(electronic business\, is the conduct of business on the Internet, not only buying and selling but also servicing customers and collaborating with business partners Today, major corporations are rethinking their businesses in terms of the Internet and its new culture and capabilities Companies are using the Web to buy parts and supplies from other companies, to collaborate on sales promotions, and to do joint research. Exploiting the convenience, availability, and world-wide reach of the Internet, is the trend of recent times The following are the challenges or limitations in the eBusiness domain presently Complex parameters During various analysis operations like business process intelligence or customer relationship management queries include with them complex parameters that are hard to parse and many times they tend to produce malicious results because of their false and complex nature Integration into complete solution Using various techniques like knowledge extraction and analytical processing of multidimensional data, intermediate results should be deciphered into complete solutions in order to complete the analytical process The above challenges can be overcome by using the following solutions Text categorization The aim of this stage is to extract content and using data build topic hierarchy. Once, a hierarchy is built it becomes easier to track customer operations and hence analyze the customer behavior. Analysis operations performed are Extraction of key words and phrases, Transformation of documents and query log records into vectors, Creation of clusters hierarchically, labeling each cluster with significant words, phrases, normalization Catalog creation and service discovery This stage aims to achieve  Attribute extraction and Data formulation. Once a document structure is recognized attribute extraction and data formulation become easier Business Process Intelligence The goal of this stage is to improve the quality of business services and processes. The recommendation system by providing apt and complete recommendations improves the quality of the system  4.1 Application Oriented Architecture  Architecture for the recommendation system based on the collective intelligence system is described as follows The recommendation system is created to test the real-time application and feasibility of collective intelligence system 4.1.1 Proposed Methodology The proposed methodology operates on a distributed file system environment based on the SOAP \(Service oriented architecture protocol\ ontology. The triangular ontology deals with service registry, service provision and remote method invocation. Hadoop clusters are used for this purpose 
294 


4.1.2 User Layer Customer/Buyer Domain: The customer/buyer domain consists of various customers and buyers who represent the clients of the architecture. A customer or buyer is any remote device seeking to analyze various data sets based on certain queries. The customer seeks access to a remote service on the service domain that analyses datasets. These remote services have direct access to a remote database Hence the customers represented in this domain have indirect access to a remote database with service domain activity as an intermediary stage  4.1.3 Collective Intelligence Layer Application Server Proxy The application server proxy performs the function of a routing table. The customer in the user layer searches for various services that are available on the distributed file system. While doing so, the first component a customer’s service query will approach is the application server proxy. The application server proxy contains a table or list of various services available on the distributed file system. Hence all the analysis services have to first register themselves with the application proxy server in order for the customer to access these services. When a service wanted by the customer is available on the service domain, the proxy deploys a remote server where this service is available to the customer  Service Domain The service domain mainly consists of one primary service, namely the recommendation system The recommendation system used here deals with recommending items for users given a rated and uninformed data set. That is, the data set that serves as the base or input will contain a list of item sets that are ranked by users using the item set. The final output will be an intelligent recommendation of unused item sets for a particular user. The item sets can be any product like books, movies, gadgets services, techniques etc. based on the real time dataset provided as input Semantic Data Visualizer The output of the analysis service machines needs to be presented in a graphical understandable and user-friendly manner to the end user who is the customer or buyer. The semantic data visualizer involves a semantic index that is used in tandem with the analytical output. The semantic parameters involved vary with each analysis. Graphs and charts are created as intermediate results \(IR\. The IR is then used to map the output onto predetermined visualization structures 4.1.4 Data Layer The data layer is the core and heart of the entire architecture. The layer has one main component: the remote data set. The remote data set is a set of item sets that are linked to each other by way of ratings. The item sets consist of customer identities and various other e-Business customer fields like products purchased, time logs, costs incurred billing information and other logs. The analysis service provider servers have independent direct access to this remote data set  5 Algorithms  The collective intelligence system hence proposed uses a platter of assorted algorithms and following are the algorithms that are being put into use in the collective intelligence system  5.1 Compression based dissimilarity measure     5.2 Frequent Pattern mining  Function dist = cdm\(a,b Save a.txta–ascii    Zip\(’a.zip’, ’a.txt    A_file = dir\(’a.zip    Save b.txt b –ascii    Zip\(’b.zip’, ’b.txt    B_file = dir\(’b.zip    A_n_b = [a       Save a_n_b.txt a_n_b –ascii   Zip\(’a_n_b.zip’, ’a_n_b.txt   A_n_b_file = dir \(’a_n_b.zip   Dist = a_n_b_file.bytes / \(a_file.bytes + b_file.bytes Return Dist End 1.

Store all the candidate 1-itemsets in the subset 5. Count the number of instances of each 1-itemsets to compose the candidate set called C1 6. Delete least frequent candidate 1-items to generate a large item set list called L1 7. Join L1 with itself to create candidate 2-itemsets C2. C2 consists of all combinations of 2-itemsets and check for the property that states ‘all nonempty subsets of frequent itemsets must also be frequent

 6 Results and graphs  The following are the two sections in which a few results have been inferred from the graphs plotted 6.1Construction and destruction time for stored filtered transactions Primarily no difference is observed when data sets are too small, as seen in Fig 6.1. However, the sorted lists tend to slow down as data set grows. RB-trees are always faster than tries, but the difference is not significant. In support count, each filtered transaction has to be visited to determine the contained candidates. If transactions are stored in a sorted list, then going through the elements is a very fast operation In the case of RB-trees and trie, this operation is slower, since a tree has to be traversed. Hence a sorted list is used despite the slowness during large data sets, due to easy traversal options  Fig 6.1: Time Vs Threshold  6.2 Writing frequent item-sets to disk The fastest results are obtained if frequent item-sets are not stored in memory but written to disk in the candidate generation process, as seen in Fig 6.2. In cases of determining small and medium sized candidates most edges lead to leaves hence removing other edges does not accelerate the algorithm too much. Hence, the memory needs can be significantly reduced if frequent item-sets are not stored in memory Consequently if frequent item-sets are needed to determine valid association rules and memory consumption is an important factor, then it is useful to write frequent item-sets to disk and read them back when the association rule discovery phase starts   7 Conclusion and future implementation The proposed collective intelligence system is hence implemented and its applications are tested using the real-time recommendation system in an e-business background. The    Fig 6.2: Time Vs Threshold recommendations hence created based on collective intelligence are accurate to a greater extent. The collective intelligence system can be extended in lines of semantic web searching to provide personalized results and optimized link retrievals. Furthermore, a mechanism or structure can be created to improve on the performance of sorted lists in case of large data sets to decrease the time complexity of creation of the filtered transactions from the data set  REFERENCES 1 Ea m o n n K e o g h  S t ef a n o Lo n a r d i Li Wei  Compression Based Data Mining of Sequential Data Springer, March 2007  e dr o D o m i n g o s   Towards Knowledge rich data mining  Springer, April 2007  r e g o r y P i a t e t s k i S h a p i r o   Data Mining and knowledge discovery from 1996-2005”, Springer, January 2007 4 La u r en t B r i s s o n  an d M a r t in e C o l l ar d   An Ontology Driven data mining process, The KEOPS approach November 2006  a ur e n t B r i s s o n  Knowledge extraction using a conceptual information system ODBIS Workshop in VLDB Conference, Seoul, 2006 6 A b r a h a m B e r n s t e i n  F o s t e r P r o v o s t, a n d S h aw n d r a H ill   Toward intelligent assistance for a data mining process: An ontology-based approach for cost-sensitive classification  IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 2005 7 B a r o n c h e ll i A  C a g l io ti E  L o r e to V   Artificial sequences and complexity measures J.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
