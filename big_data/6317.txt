The paper also analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of FP-max based mining algorithm. This proposed algorithm could be used to the correlated data mining of the network learning behaviors to obtain the visit frequency of the learning resources, which helps to provide important reference to the improve the network learning system KeywordsAssociation Rule; Max Frequent Pattern Frequent Item Set; FP-array I  I NTR O D U C T ION  W it h th e po p ularity of computer network, network learning system attracts more and more users for its resource share, open system and easy collaboration. But there are many personality differences among users such as different learning objectives, different learning abilities, different knowledge base and different learning habits. This increases the difficulty to the construction of network learning resource Applying association rules to personality learning could help learners' commonness and personality. We can conclude learners' learning manners and habits by studying the visit manners and frequency of users' access to learning resources we can make judgment to abnormalities too This paper proposes an algorithm based on FP-array for max frequent item sets mining, which can used to study users' behaviors in the network mining learning process. This algorithm could help construct the network learning resource II   FPMAX B ASED A LGORITHM  A  Basic concept Let the set of item s I={I 1 I 2   I n transaction database D=<T 1 T 2   T n here T  I. If X in cludes K elements and X  D, X is cal led k-itemset For each X, if its support number is not less than the given threshold value m, X is called Frequent Pattern \(FP\ or Frequent Item Set \(FIS If X is an FIS and any of its supersets is frequent, X is Max Frequent Pattern \(MFP\ or Max Frequent Item Set MFIS\; the set composed of all the MFPs is called Max Frequent Set \(MFS In Frequent Pattern tree \(FP-tree\, each node is composed of node name, node count, node list and parent pointer. In order to traverse the tree easily, header table is constructed by item name and item list head. The item list head points to the first node with the same name in FP-tree B  FP-Max based mining algorithm of FP-Tree The key of FP-Max based mining algorithm is to find all MFPs and divide this process into FP-Tree construction and FP-Tree mining The advantages of this algorithm are: \(a\implement the most time-consuming Frequent Item \(FI\ calculation by a simple search on FP-tree, \(b\divide-and-conquer strategy to create FP-tree for the different prediction sets given by users, and \(c\ determine FI according to the two given threshold values: confidence degree and length [2   The disadvantages of this algorithm are: \(a\ew FIs may be generated and the original FIs may be increased when the minimum support threshold v alue remains unchanged, and \(b when creating FP-tree, more traversal time is needed during the two scans of the da  III  MFI  M INING A LGORITHM B ASED ON FPARRAY  A  FP-array constru ction 4, 5   1\ Matrix construction Suppose that each column value of the matrix represents one or more compressed stored records, where there are no duplicate columns in the matrix If all transactions refer to N items totally, the length of the column vector is N; if an item occurs in one transaction, the bit will be 1, else it will be 0. Now there are 5 items C 1 C 2  C 3 C 4 C 5 if the prese nt transactions are C 1 and C 4 the column vector corresponding to the present transactions is 10010. If there exist the same columns in the matrix, the weight value of the column vector plus 1; add the calculated column vector into the association matrix as a column, the weight value of this column is 1. The weight value of each column represents the occurrence times of the transaction in the database  2\ Calculate the support number of each item Remove all the rows of non-frequent item according to the given minimum support threshold value; sort FP-array according to the descending order of the support number If the item sequence is C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 C 5 the transaction database D can be seen in Table I

We need preprocess the raw data before data mining. After analysis, we know that users are also interested in the study resources of other classes when they are online learning, even if some users only learn about one class. So we should firstly find the learning events whose network learning resource is larger than a given threshold value. Suppose that the threshold value is 2, we can obtain 805 meaningful records after preprocessing the 1438 records in the data table, where there are 322 records with high learning frequency . We also find 9 learning manners which are most frequently used from the preprocessing Table III shows the 9 learning manners TABLE III  M AIN LEARNING RESOURCES  SourceTypeCode Type MiningCode C 1 Text Resource 1 C 2 Video Resource 2 C 3 Task Driving 3 C 4  Follow Me SBS 4 C 5 Experiments 5 C 6 Chapter Exercises 6 C 7 Combine Exercises 7 C 8 Chapter Examinations 8 C 9 Combine Examinations 9  We use association rule algorithm to mine the relationship of different learning behaviors and adopt C# to process it.

Here CPU is Intel I5 2.7 GHz the memory is 2 GB, the operation system is Windows7, the test database is LAI database and the program is implemented by C#. LAI database includes 14530 records which recorded different users' learning behaviors. The performance of FP-array based algorithm and FP-max based algorithm under different minimum support degrees is compared in Fig. 1  Figure 1  Performance compare of FP-max based algorithm and FP-array based algorithm As can be seen from Fig. 1, the mean performance of the proposed algorithm is better than FP-max based algorithm when the itemset is very huge and sparse. In addition, the change amplitude of the proposed algorithm's execution time is very small under different minimum support degrees; the execution time is just 0.4 seconds more when the minimum support degree increases from 1% to 20%. This shows that the proposed algorithm has better stability and scalability  The c o m p utation of FParr a y b a sed al gori th m will be very huge when the data set is very dense V  C ONCLUSIONS  FP-array based algorithm proposed in this paper doesn't need to add new transactions into the transaction database constantly, so the count of the original frequent items or new generated frequent items remains constant when the 2 0 3 45 2 3 41 4 3 0 32 17 17 4 5 45 32 0 3 5 24 7 2 17 3 0 7 26 8 3 17 5 7 0 4 9 41 4 24 26 4 0  2 4 5 7 8 9   012\012\012 012\012 015\012\012 015\012 012\012 012 012\012 012 012\012 012 012\012 012\015\012\015

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
