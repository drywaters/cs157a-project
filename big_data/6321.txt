HadoopWatch A First Step Towards Comprehensive Trafìc Forecasting in Cloud Computing Yang Peng Kai Chen Guohui Wang   Wei Bai Zhiqiang Ma Lin Gu Hong Kong University of Science and Technology  Facebook Abstract This paper presents our effort towards comprehensive trafìc forecasting for big data applications using external light-weighted le system monitoring Our idea is motivated by the key observations that rich trafìc demand information already exists in the log and meta-data les of many big data applications and that such information can be readily extracted through run-time le system monitoring As the rst step we use Hadoop 1 as a concrete example to explore our methodology and develop a system called HadoopWatch to predict trafìc demand of Hadoop applications We further implement HadoopWatch in our real small-scale testbed with 10 physical servers and 30 virtual machines Our experiments over a series of MapReduce applications demonstrate that HadoopWatch can forecast the trafìc demand with almost 100 accuracy and time advance Furthermore it makes no modiìcation of the Hadoop framework and introduces little overhead to the application performance I I NTRODUCTION The explosion of big data applications has imposed signiìcant challenges on the design of network infrastructure in cloud and data center environments Researchers have proposed various new network architectures 2 18 and trafìc engineering mechanisms 3 5 to handle the rapid growth of bandwidth requirement in data center networks Many of these proposals leverage the knowledge of application trafìc demands to customize network design For example Hedera MicroTE 5 and D3 32 perform o w-le v e l trafìc engineering and rate control based on predicted trafìc demands Helios c-Through 28 and OSA 6 rely on accurate trafìc demand estimation to perform dynamic optical circuit provisioning More recently researchers have also looked into the tight integration of applications and network to conìgure the network topology and routing based on application run-time trafìc demands 14 29 All these systems require comprehensive understanding of application trafìc in data center networks  the ability to forecast trafìc demand before packets enter the network However it is difìcult to predict application trafìc demand accurately All the existing solutions focus on using heuristic algorithms based on the measurement of network level parameters For example Hedera and Helios 12 estimate trafìc demands using ow counter measurement on switches c-Through and Mahout 8 use sock et b u f fer occupancy at end hosts to estimate trafìc demands for different destinations However these schemes fall short First most of them cannot predict the trafìc demand before the trafìc 1 One of the most popular and widely-used open-source software framework in cloud computing enters the network Second parameters observed on network paths cannot accurately reîect the truth of application demands due to the noise of background ows and congestion control at end hosts Third they fail to capture the ne-grained trafìc dependencies and priorities information imposed by applications As a result these network layer solutions are shown to perform poorly in predicting the real application demands which further leads to undesired performance in network provisioning and trafìc engineering mechanisms using these demands In this paper we explore an alternative solution to provide comprehensive trafìc forecasting at application layer With application speciìc information application layer trafìc forecasting is expected to achieve more accurate trafìc demand estimation However there are several design issues that make this approach challenging and interesting for exploration  Ahead-of-time The scheme must be able to predict trafìc demand before the data is sent to the network so that it can be most useful for network conìguration and trafìc engineering  Transparency Many big data applications in data centers are complex distributed applications Trafìc forecasting should be transparent to these applications and do not modify any application codes  Light-weighted Trafìc forecasting should be lightweighted Many data center applications are large scale systems with high performance requirements The trafìc forecasting system should not introduce much overhead to degrade the application performance and it should scale gracefully with the number of computing nodes and concurrent jobs  Fine-grained An application layer trafìc forecaster is expected to provide more ne-grained trafìc demand information than just trafìc volume For example many distributed applications have computation barriers that cause dependencies among multiple ows and ows with more dependencies need high priorities in transfer Such structural information will be useful to enable better network control and optimization We observe that rich trafìc demand information exists in the log and meta-data les of many big data applications and such information can be extracted efìciently through run-time le system monitoring We use Hadoop as a concrete example to explore the design of application layer trafìc forecasting using le system monitoring We develop a system called IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications 978-14799-3360-0/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 19 


HadoopWatch which is a passive monitoring agent attached to the Hadoop framework that monitors the meta-data and logs of Hadoop jobs to forecast application trafìc before the data is sent It does not require any modiìcation to the Hadoop framework We have implemented HadoopWatch and deployed it on a real small-scale testbed with 10 physical machines and 30 virtual machines Our experiments over a series of MapReduce applications demonstrate that HadoopWatch can forecast the application layer trafìc demand with almost 100 accuracy and time advance while introducing little overhead to the application performance Our work is a rst step towards comprehensive trafìc forecasting at the application layer Many research problems remain to be explored in future work However we believe our work shows early promises of performing comprehensive and light-weighted trafìc forecasting through le system monitoring which could be a useful building block for tight network and application integration in cloud and data center environments Roadmap The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section  II introduces the background and key observations that enables the forecasting architecture Section  III presents the design of HadoopWatch Section  IV discusses the implementation and evaluation results of HadoopWatch Section  V reviews the related works We discuss the future work and conclude the paper in Section  VI II T RAFFIC F ORECASTING VIA F ILE S YSTEM M ONITORING Due to a variety of data exchange requirements there is a large amount of network trafìc in the life cycle of a Hadoop job We rst brieîy introduce the Hadoop architecture and its dataîow in different stages Then to motivate our key idea of forecasting application trafìc through external lightweight le system monitoring we introduce the observations and opportunities in le systems that provide rich-semantics enabling trafìc forecasting A Hadoop Background Hadoop consists of Hadoop MapReduce and Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS Hadoop MapReduce is an implementation of MapReduce designed for large clusters while HDFS is a distributed le system designed for batch-oriented workloads Each job in MapReduce has two phases First users specify a map function that processes the input data to generate a list of intermediate key-value pairs Second a user-deìned reduce function is called to merge all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key HDFS is used to store both the input to the map and the output of the reduce  but the intermediate results such as the output of the map  are stored in each nodeês local le system A Hadoop implementation contains a single master node and many worker nodes The master node called the JobTracker handles job requests from user clients divide these jobs into multiple tasks and assign each task to a worker node for execution Each worker node maintains a TaskTracker process that executes the tasks assigned to itself Typically a TaskTracker has a xed number of slots for accepting tasks B Hadoop Dataîows Many Hadoop jobs are communication intensive involving a large amount of data transfer during their execution We broadly characterize Hadoop dataîows into three types  Import  The map reads data from HDFS  To increase overall data loading throughput of a job multiple concurrent map tasks may be scheduled to fetch data in parallel Speciìcally for each map task the JobTracker will specify its input split As a map task runs it will fetch the corresponding data in the form of key-value pairs from HDFS and iteratively perform the user deìned map function over it Optimized with various scheduling techniques 30 most map tasks achie v e data locality  while there also exist some non-local map tasks reading their input splits from remote DataNodes which involve network transfer  Shufîe  Intermediate results are shufîed from the map to the reduce  Before the reduce function is called a reduce task requires intermediate results from multiple map tasks as its input When a map task nishes it will write its output to local disk commit to the JobTracker and reclaim the resources Meanwhile the reduce task will periodically query the JobTracker for any latest map completion events Being aware of these nished map tasks and their output locations a reduce task initiates a few threads and randomly requests intermediate data from the TaskTracker daemons on these nodes  Export  The reduce writes output to HDFS  Large output data is partitioned into multiple x-sized blocks 2  while each of them is replicated to three DataNodes in a pipeline 24 A Hadoop job completes after the outputs of all reduce tasks are successfully stored C Observations and Opportunities Rich trafìc information in le systems Most cloud big data applications such as Hadoop have various le system activities during the job execution We observe that these le system activities usually contain rich information about the job run-time status and its upcoming network trafìc First logging is a common facility in big data applications for troubleshooting and debugging purposes However these log le entries can also be used to identify network trafìc For example the source and destination of a shufîe ow in MapReduce can be determined after locating a pair of map and reduce tasks while such task scheduling results are written in the JobTrackerês log Besides intermediate computing results and meta-data are periodically spilled to disk due to limited capacity of memory allocation The size of all the output partitions of a map task is 2 The last block in a le may be smaller IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications 20

believe application layer trafìc forecasting is a key building block to enable workload optimized networking in cloud data centers and tightly integrate network design with applications We have implemented HadoopWatch and deployed it on a small-scale testbed with 10 physical machines and 30 virtual machines Our experiments over a series of MapReduce applications demonstrate that HadoopWatch can forecast the application layer trafìc demand with very high accuracy and time advance while introducing little overhead to the application performance Our work is a rst attempt exploring the rich research space of comprehensive trafìc forecasting at application layer With the surge of software deìned networking in cloud data centers we believe HadoopWatch can be useful in a many scenarios that target to jointly optimize application performance and network conìguration e.g from topology optimization trafìc engineering ow scheduling to transport control etc In the meanwhile we also acknowledge that there are many research problems remain to be explored in our future work For example HadoopWatch is now a trafìc forecaster particularly designed for the Hadoop framework The le selection and monitoring mechanisms are tied to the speciìc parameters of the Hadoop system An important direction of our future work is to explore the generic design principles to apply the forecasting mechanisms to different big data applications such as Dryad HBase 1 Spark 34 etc VII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank the INFOCOM anonymous reviewers for their comments HKUST REC12EG07 funding
