This paper proposes a research and 
operational model which effectively enhances Group Recommender Model to boost the customer purchases For this purpose, it uses the communication and collaboration of two major sources namely Mobile Money Operator and Outlet. MMO proactively monitors the spending pattern of the customers who make purchases using their mobile money. Outlet performs customer segmentation based on RFM Recency, Frequency and Monetary score after which a Recursive Cluster Elimination is performed that eliminates customers within the targeted segment Recursive Frequent Itemset Mining and Recursive Market Basket Analysis are performed for the rest of customers in the targeted segment. From the obtained results, the product preferences of the remaining 
customers in the segment are identified based on which offers are formulated and recommended for the entire segment. It is then communicated to the MMO that intimates these offers to the potential customers among the segment. This model results in boosting customer purchases, expanding customer base and effects in the profitability of the combined source Keywords: Customers; Mobile Money Operator MMO\s; Recursive Frequent Itemset Mining \(RFIM\rsive Clustering Elimination RCE\ecursive Market Basket Analysis \(RMBA  I  INTRODUCTION The customer is the end goal of businesses since it is the customer who makes purchase and creates demand that helps in the growth of the business. So, customer satisfaction has been regarded as the crucial activity in the 
field of Marketing. Different customer groups have different consumption behavior. As the toll of high spenders and frequent shoppers has grown like topsy, the liabilities to meet the interests of these customers have increased rapidly. To explore the purchase interests of the customer, a Recommender System at atte m p ts to  analyze a customer’s purchase history is employed so that offers for those specific products can be recommended to customers. When this recommender system is applied for a group of customers with similar purchase interest then 
this becomes a Group Recommender System. The important sources that connect customers with the system are described below Mobile Money is a mobile financial service provided by the MMO that enables their subscribers to convert their liquid cash into e-money in order to pay bills and accounts, top up mobile credit and receive money across the country’s telecom networks h e MMO s t ores all the transaction detail records of customers making purchases through mobile money over a period of time 
The outlet is considered a place of business for retailing goods These outlets store a wide range of datasets that contain the customer’s transaction and purchase details over a period of time. These datasets are used to evaluate and explore the offer recommendations to boost the customer purchases.  In the existing system, customers need to accustom to offers available for products that may not interest them but compromise on their choices just for the sake of saving their shopping expense Our Group Recommender System evolves from a 
Personalized Recommender System that targets the customer group rather than an individual. This paper builds a system that is not only able to extract consumer behavioral features from their consumptive information but also to analyze, operate and evaluate these extracted features with enhanced techniques such as Recursive Cluster Elimination, Recursive Frequent Itemset Mining and Recursive Market Basket Analysis. In this kind of an approach, the scope of product purchase will be limited since the items focused for offers and their MBA rely on 
these items Generally, offers vary for each individual. When these offers are intimated individually, the cost for formulating offers and the time to perform the process increases making this approach a failure. Our contributions to the proposed work which enhances the traditional system are as follows   We define a group recommender model as shown in Fig 1 for customers in the outlet that recommends offers to the group on the basis of the

Fig 1: Group Recommender Model for Boosting and Optimizing Customer Purchases purchase interests of the most potential customers in that group   We establish a link between two different sources namely MMO and Outlet that connects customers with the enticing offers for their product preferences   Frequent Itemset Mining and Association Rule Mining for customers within the targeted cluster is performed using a platform called HPCC  High  Performance Computing Cluster h ic h s e rv e s as a  massive parallel-processing computing platform   We perform K-Means Clustering using Weka [4  and Market Basket Analysis using HPCC recursively to come out with an enhanced and efficient result that recommends offers not only for their product preferences but also for the items correlated with those products. This enhances the purchase behavior that was prevalent in Individual Recommender System and produces better results This paper is organized as follows: the following section presents the overview of the existing work in this system. Later, we describe about the varied techniques adopted in this paper. Subsequently, we elucidate the experimental analysis of the dataset used in our model Finally, we conclude with the implications of our proposed research model  II  RELATED WORK The major part of the research on group recommendation investigated the core algorithms used for generating the group recommendations. Different strategies are available and two main approaches have been proposed T h e f i rs t con s ists of creati n g a j o in t user profile for all the users in the group and then performing a recommendation for this artificial user represented by the group prof  T h is  w o u l d provide a recommendation for the group that is based on all user profiles and in some way represent group interests mediated in the group profile. The second approach aggregates the recommendations for each individual member into a single group recommendation li One of the most commonly-used and successfullydeployed recommendation approaches is collaborative filtering. In the field of collaborative filtering, two types of methods are widely studied: neighborhood-based approaches and model-based approaches. Neighborhoodbased methods mainly focus on finding the similar users  s 10] f o r recomm en datio n s Modelbas e d  methods provide item recommendations by first developing a model of user ratings  In our work we are concerned with recommendations to the entire group based on items purchased by potential members of the group. This does not incorporate the above mentioned approaches to promote recommendations. Here, the product preferences of the most potential customers are recommended for the entire group. The most potential customers \(most loyal customers\ have a good record of purchase history. When their items are recommended, there will be offers for myriad products and the scope of purchase can be improved significantly III  BACKGROUND A  Group Recommender Model Recommendation is a particular form of information filtering, which exploits past behaviors and user similarities to generate a list of information items that is personally tailored to an end-user's preferences Recommender systems have traditionally recommended items to individual users, but there has recently been a proliferation of recommenders that address their recommendations to groups of users. Group recommenders are built to help groups of people decide a

common activity or item. The recommendation for the group will in general be based on information about preferences of individual group members h eref ore  some type of aggregation method is required, by which information about individual preferences is combined in such a way that the system can assess the suitability of particular items for a group as a wh   B  Recursive Cluster Elimination Customer groups are formed according to customer behavior. RFM is behavioral model which considers past customer purchases r os pect th e fu t u re cu sto m er  behaviors. The parameters Recency \(R\ines the latest purchase made by the customer, Frequency \(F\ defines the number of purchases made within a certain period and Monetary \(M\ines the money spent during a certain period. This paper involves the “User Definable Band method to calculate RFM score that adds up the values of R, F and M values. Using this method, we can define specific bands for R, F, M that can be set based on certain criteria. Here the bands of R, F, M are measured in a scale of 1 to 5.This may vary from user to user. For example if last visit>=0 day and last visit<51 days then R can be scaled as 5  if\(number of transactions>=15 then F can be scaled as 5  if\(Transaction Amount>=15000 then M can be scaled as 5 Similarly, the values 4 to 1for the parameters can be calculated. Now, a Partitioning Clustering technique called K-Means Clustering  s  adopted to segment the customers in the outlet. The results of the clustering are obtained using a WEKA The K-Means clustering is a centroid based approach that accurately performs the clustering. Consider Fig 2 in which the 1\ customer purchases  in the outlet 2\sing the stored purchase details, RFM score is calculated  3  C ustomers \(here n=15\ in the outlet are clustered based on RFM value into three segments namely “High Medium and Low This is considered as the first cluster step. Here, the centroids are chosen randomly based on RFM scores. It is then recalculated to get a modified centroid using which the scores nearest to the modified centroid is clustered in one group until no score switches clusters. After the first cluster step  4\ a particular group for which recommendation has to be made is targeted  and 5\ Recursive Cluster Elimination 16 is performed as shown in Section IV. In this case, the high cluster is being targeted. The RCE output holds only three most preferred customers as depicted in Fig 2 Here, by using RCE we are only eliminating the customers with low R, F scores within the high cluster rather than eliminating the whole of the low cluster  6\he output of RCE is used as the input of RFIM  C4, C5, C6 customers are eliminated and C1, C2, C3 are most active within the targeted cluster C  Recursive Frequent Itemset Mining The Frequent Itemset Mining is used to find frequent itemset present in a database. Apriori Algorithm    is designed to operate on databases containing transactions For example, collections of items bought by customers The input for this algorithm is derived from results of the FIM. Here, products which occur frequently are identified   Fig 2: Recursive Cluster Elimination and various scans are performed for it. This scan is nothing but the iterative search for products that occur frequently. This can be determined with a certain support count  In traditional FIM, the support count of an itemset X is defined as the number of transactions that contain X  Pr odu cts  w h os e s u pport cou n t i s belo w a certai n  threshold are pruned. Here, the frequent itemset scan is performed for products purchased by customers in   the preferred group and this is done recursively to find the most preferred products by them. Frequent item set mining leads to the discovery of associations and correlations among items in large transactional or relational datasets present in the outlet  D  Recursive Market Basket Analysis Association Rule Mining represents an unsupervised learning method that attempts to capture associations between groups of items. MBA has also been referred to in the literature as Association Rule Mining or Affinity analysis[19  A p rio r i is a se m i n a l al g o rith m  f o r m i n i n g  frequent itemsets and identifying associations for varied customer purchases. In this model, the customers are clustered in the outlet using RFM score as discussed in sub-section B of section III. The output of frequent itemset mining is taken up as input for the MBA. Then the Market Basket Analysis [2 m a de f o r a n i n div i d u al i s  merged to perform a recursive MBA which represents the group recommendation using which offers can be correlated and intimated to the customers. Here, the offers are formulated on the basis of the results obtained from the RMBA which are then intimated to the customer’s mobile through MMO  IV  PROPOSED SYSTEM This section consists of establishing a relationship between Outlet, MMO and Customer to design the group recommender model. Sub-section A deals with the architecture of the proposed system and Sub-section B deals with the algorithm of proposed system by incorporating the K-Means, RFIM, RMBA techniques in our system

A. Basic Architecture  Fig 3: Overall Architecture of Proposed System The above architecture consists of varied components represented in small rectangular boxes that are employed to build our group recommender system. Customers are the initiators of the model. They make purchase 1 in some outlet and make payment using their mobile money  2 The transaction details are logged in the MMO and purchase details are recorded in the outlet for future references. With those details as the base, the MMO performs the Spend Analyzer 3 to identify the domain in which a subscriber is interested in and it obtains the customer’s willingness for the service and stores it for future reference 4 The outlet also performs a purchase analyzer 5 that examines the customer’s purchase details and determines their distinct purchase interests. It clusters customer 6 and performs a frequent itemset mining recursively 7 to identify the product preferences of the customer. It also performs market basket analysis recursively 8 to find the product affinity and to formulate offers 9 for the group. Finally, the outlet communicates the offer details of the group to the MMO 10 The MMO performs potential customer verification  12  and notifies offers to customer group  13   Algorithm of Proposed System The algorithm for Recursive cluster elimination 1 has been designed to identify the most potential customers whose purchase records are used as a tool to recommend offers for the entire group. In this, the cluster step includes the customer segmentation in the outlet using KMeans clustering based on RFM scores. The results are run on Weka in which the customers are segmented into three clusters. We cluster them into three categories as small number of segments can target a large number of customers. This saves cost, time and also ensures a greater probability of customers availing the offers. The next step targets a particular group from the three groups high, low, medium\ng an incrementer i, the  R, F, M values of each customer in that group targeted  is checked for elimination. The threshold values for R and F are compared with the R and F values of each customer in that group              Here, the threshold values of R and F are considered because Recency and Frequency is very important for Loyalty based Marketing even though their monetary value might change from time to time. In this case, the threshold value for R\(t 1 d F\(t 2 may be set as 3 for a scale ranging from 1 to 5. This varies according to the user as already mentioned in section II. The customers are retained only if their R and F values are greater than the threshold values set. The other customers are eliminated within that group. Now, the purchase interests of these customers are analyzed and those items and their correlated items are recommended to the entire group                   2.

Frequent Itemset Mining \(2\e purchase details of the customers retained in the targeted group obtained using RCE. Initially, the frequent itemset mining and the MBA for the individuals in the group is carried out. The customers from the output of Recursive Cluster Elimination are targeted and their corresponding frequent itemsets are considered. From these itemsets purchased by the customers the possible and the frequent combination of itemsets are identified by using the machine learning algorithm tools. From the available combination of itemsets the frequent itemset bought by the customers in the targeted cluster is identified and recursive market basket analysis is made for them. The resulting combination of itemsets is recommended for the entire group which covers almost all the customers present in the targeted cluster. Here the thresholds t 3 represent the summation of support count of maximum products present to the total number of products of each customer and t 4 represent the average of total number of combination varieties of itemsets present. If the support count of every product is greater than the threshold value t 3 d the item to the frequent itemsets and identify their corresponding itemsets. The itemsets and the associations which are ranked below this threshold are eliminated. If the maximum combination of itemsets is greater than the threshold value \(t 4 hat item is consider ed to be resultant itemset that covers the maximum number of customers present in the group V  EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS  A. Data Set The data for the empirical study involves the customers’ purchase history stored in the outlet and their corresponding transaction detail records stored in the MMO for a period of one year. This study involves a in a simulated dataset containing the records of the customers single outlet and single MMO derived from a real dataset consisting of thousands of customers, hundreds of outlets specific MMOs and lakhs of transactions. Due to the space constraints, we briefly outline the experimental results of our proposed system using the above result set B. Comparison with other models Table 1 describes specific experimental comparison between our proposed system and other models  Inference The above result set is obtained by carrying out experimentation in an outlet consisting of n customers say n=100\e customers are clustered into 3 segments say High, Medium, Low by performing clustering using K-means Case I: A particular customer is targeted from any of the segment and techniques such as FIM, MBA are carried out. The total time taken to formulate and send custom built offers to all customers in the outlet is 17 min 10 sec Case II: Here, a whole segment is targeted and the techniques such as FIM, MBA are carried out recursively By performing this, we can send custom built offers to the TABLE 1     EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON CASES I II III MODEL Individual Recommender  Group Recommender  Group Recommender  Proposed System  TARGETS Individual Group Group CLUSTERING WEKA 0.02 sec 0.02 sec 0.02 sec FIM & MBA HPCC 10 sec 11.36 min 42 sec RECURSIVE CLUSTERING WEKA NO NO 0 sec RFIM RMBA HPCC NO 25 sec 16 sec Summation 10.02 sec 12 min 03 sec 58.02 sec Total Time Taken in Outlet Outlet=n customers Say n=100 n*10.02 sec 17min 10 sec Clusters =k Say k=3 k*12 min 03 sec 36min 15 sec Clusters =k Say k=3 k* 58.02 sec 3 min 20 sec  customers in a particular segment targeted and total time taken to formulate and send offers to all the customers in the outlet is 36 min 15 sec Case III:  Here, a whole segment is targeted and the techniques such as FIM, MBA are performed for the targeted cluster recursively. Next, the most potential customers within the targeted segment are identified by performing clustering recursively and similarly FIM and MBA are executed recursively. By adopting this kind of approach, we can send custom built offers to all the customers in a segment based on the  purchase interests of the most potential customers. The total time taken to formulate and send offers to all the customers in the outlet is 3 min 20 sec So by comparing the above cases, Case III performs clustering, FIM and MBA recursively and is considered the best since it is less time consuming and custom built offers are sent to many customers unlike the other cases The most potential customers’ purchase influences the purchase of the whole segment. When this model was carried out without RCE and with RFIM and RMBA, the same output was obtained. This kind of an approach time involved lot of complexities and time delay. The ratio of taken for the approach with \(No RCE+ RFIM+ RMBA the approach with \(RCE+RFIM+RMBA\was evaluated to 12:1. Since, the approach with \(RCE+ RFIM+ RMBA produced similar results in much lesser time; this is

regarded as the accurate method of recommending offers This magnifies the purchase power of the customers and they can choose from a wide variety of products tagged with offers. The offers for the above mentioned products and the other products associated with it are recommended to the group. As shown in Fig 4, the final results of RFIM and RMBA for the products purchased by the most potential customers are P, O, E, D, B. The offers for these products are recommended to the whole targeted segment. By adopting this model, the execution time can be exponentially reduced and this makes our group recommender model unique compared to other models  Fig 4: RFIM and RMBA for most potential customers VI  CONCLUSION  Group Recommender Systems allow businesses to leverage their customer history to notify custom built offers to their customers. In this system, the customer’s spending pattern and buying behavior is monitored and examined based on which relevant offers are notified to the customer’s mobile. Here techniques such as Recursive Cluster elimination, Recursive Frequent Itemset Mining and recursive market basket analysis provide an enhanced  and optimized result using which offers can be correlated and recommended to the customers via SMS. This can be achieved by the communication and collaboration of the two sources namely MMO and outlet. This kind of Product-associated recommendation allows businesses to respond to each customer's current interests and allow the natural associations among different products to guide customers to the right purchase. When such innovative enticing ads for products and its corresponding associations are promoted from secured and legal organizations such as MMO, customers spare a thought to subscribe to this service which depends on the willingness of him/her. Loyalty based marketing approach is implemented where the customer base is expanded in the MMO and outlet. Rewarding the customers with valuable recommendations based on their input results in boosting their purchase which serves as a boon to the outlet in terms of revenue   REFERENCES  1  Prem Melville and Vikas Sindhwani, “Recommender Systems Encyclopedia of Machine Learning 2010: 829-838 2  Alberto Jimenez, Prasanna Vanguri, “Cash Replacement through Mobile Money in Emerging Markets: The FISA Approach”, July 2010 3  http  www.hpccsystems.com  4  Ian H.

6 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we proposed a novel approach called ReARM for discovering traceability links based on association rule mining and operation-based change tracking Our approach operates on a broad set of artifacts as part of a uni\002ed model including UML models and project management models such as schedules In contrast to contentbased approaches we do not only consider the model at a certain point in time but we take its history into account and thereby also the activity of the developers working on the model activity-centric This results in two main advantages First content-based approaches such as similarity search using latent semantic indexing LSI do not address traceability as an activity that is carried out by developers in a software project but only consider their static work products such as requirement documents or use case descriptions Recovered links are not rated by frequency of use and might thus of limited interest for the actual activities performed in a speci\002c software development project Second since we do not rely on content we can discover links even in situations where content is sparse or the involved artifacts are not related in content but nevertheless require a traceability link These situations often occur when a model is still under development and not yet complete correct nor consistent Our approach can be used in addition to existing content-based approaches completing their results with links that are not related in content but according to their change history We applied the ReARM approach to the artifacts generated by an industrial project in order to show its feasibility and to evaluate the link recovery results We conclude that our approach represents a useful alternative to contentbased approaches especially in situations where these approaches fail Traceability links that do not result from similarity in content and links among artifacts with sparse content The ReARM approach is not limited to traceability link recovery and also shows a potential for other applications In future work we will apply our technique to change impact analysis scenarios Cost and time metrics based on the result of ReARM can be used to quantify the impact of a change which in turn may support a go/no-go decision of the project's change committee References  R Agra w al T

hour after the min_sup becomes smaller than 0.4. However the MPFCI algorithm can find all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets efficiently. This explains that the computational cost of directly testing frequent closed probability increases sharply with the increase of the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets \(The number increases w.r.t the increase of min_sup\milar results can be found in Fig. 5\(b\which also reports comparison of running time in T20I10D30KP40 dataset. Hence, it is inefficien t to directly check frequent closed probabilities of all probabilistic frequent itemsets which can be obtain by existing solution, such as TODIS [22  Next, we focus on the test of effectiveness of different pruning strategies Effect of min_sup in MPFCI We firstly investigated the running time of five compared algorithms w.r.t. the minimum support, min_sup. Fig. 6\(a\ shows the running time of all algorithms while min_sup changes from 0.2 to 0.6 in Mushroom dataset. When min_sup decreases, we observe that the running time of all the algorithms goes up due to the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets increases. However we find that the growth speed of MPFCI is the lowest due to all pruning methods it employed. We also find that MPFCINoCH has the similar running time with that of MPFCI. This indicates that the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound pruning contributes less to reduce the total running time compared to other pruning methods. In addition, MPFCI-NoBound is the slowest algorithm. In particular the running time of MPFCINoBound is larger than 1 hour when min_sup is smaller 0.3 Similar results can be found in Fig. 6\(b\hich reports the running time of all algorithms in T20I10D30KP40  dataset Effect of pfct in MPFCI We continue to test the running time of five compared algorithms with varying the probabilistic frequent closed threshold, pfct in two different b\, we can obverse that MPFCI is always the fastest algorithm. With regards to the change of pfct, the running time of all algorithms remains approximately the same. Thus, in tuple-model uncertain transaction database we can discover that the influence of probabilistic frequent closed threshold will be smaller than that of min_sup to the total running time. Meanwhile, MPFCI is the fastest algorithm and MPFCI-NoBound is still the slowest one, which indicates that the probabilistic bound pruning is more effective than other pruning methods  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 5 Efficiency Comparison between MPFCI and Naïve  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 6 Running time w.r.t min_sup    a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 7 Running time w.r.t pfct   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 8 Running time w.r.t 0010   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 9 Running time w.r.t 001  Effect of 000H 000H in MPFCI In this part, we mainly analyse the influence of the relative tolerance error  0010 to the running time in Fig. 8 \(a\\(b\ With the change of 0010 we can observe: 1 four algorithms, MPFCI, MPFCI-NoCH, MPFCI-NoSuper and MPFCI-NoSub, keep a steady running time. 2\e algorithm of MPFCI-NoBound becomes slower clearly when 0010  becomes lower. In addition, the above observations also verify the time complexity analysis of the approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability. Because the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm does not use any probabilistic bound pruning to reduce redundant computation for frequent closed probability, we have to compute closed probabilities of all itemsets which cannot be removed by other pruning methods.  Please note that the time complexity of our approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability is 2 4 ln\(2       Ok UTD 000G\000H Moreover, the running time of approximation algorithm will increase 2 1   O 000H with the decreasing of 0010 Thus, the decreasing of 000H causes more influence to the running time of the MPFCI-NoBound

algorithm. Moreover, other four algorithms utilize the probabilistic bounds pruning, so they can avoid redundant computation of frequent closed probabilities Effect of 000G 000G in MPFCI We finally studied the influence of running time from the probabilistic confidence degree parameter 000G in  Fig. 9 \(a\d \(b\We can find the similar effect with the change of 000H Namely, the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm is also affected greatly by the change of 000G By comparing the results in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we can discover that the influence of 000G on the running time of MPFCINoBound is smaller than the influence of 000H This is because with decreasing of 000G the running time of MPFCI-NoBound about computing frequent closed probability will increase ln\(2   O 000G   B  Compression Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we mainly evaluate the compression quality of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in probabilistic data against that of frequent closed itemsets in exact data. Without loss of gene rality, we test the compression quality under two different di stributions over Mushroom dataset. The first one makes the Mushroom follows Gaussian distribution whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. The second one follows Gaussian distribu tion whose mean is 0.5 and variance is 0.25 \(Namely, the default set of the Mushroom dataset in our experiments\n addition, we keep same default values of pfct=0.8 000H 0.1, and 000G 0.1 as used in the last subsection We compare the number of itemsets of frequent itemsets for short FI\, frequent closed itemsets \(for short FCI probabilistic frequent itemsets \(for short PFI\, and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets \(for short PFCI\he first two kinds of itemsets are produced by FP-growth algorithm orithm 24] f r o m th e exa ct Mushroom dataset. The PFI and PFCI are generated by TODIS algorithm r alg orithm respecti v e l y   Fig. 10 \(a\hows the comparison of the number of above four kinds of itemsets under the uncertain Mushroom dataset whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. With min_sup decreasing from 0.3 to 0.1, we observe that the ratio between Number of FCI and Number of FI declines sharply Meanwhile, the ratio between Number of PFCI and Number of PFI also declines quickly. That means the probabilistic frequent closed itemsets over uncertain data have the similar compression effect with frequent closed itemsets in exact data Fig. 10 \(b\ also shows the similar compression result However, we also observe that the compression effect of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in Fig. 10 \(b\is worse than that in Fig. 10 \(a\hat is because Fig. 10 \(b\he smaller mean than Fig. 10 \(a\as the higher variance than Fig. 10 \(a\ The smaller mean and higher variance indicate higher uncertainty, which leads to less number of probabilistic frequent itemsets and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets under same threshold To sum up, above results demonstrate that our definition of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps the good compression property of frequent closed itemsets in exact data  a  Mean  0.8,  Var=0.1                     \(b  Mean  0.5,  Var=0.25 Fig. 10 Compression Quality  w.r.t min_sup  C  Approximation Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the approximation quality of our mining algorithm since the problem of computing frequent closed probability has been proven as a #P-Hard problem Because approximation effect of our algorithm is determined by the relative tolerance error 0010 and the probabilistic confidence degree parameter  001 we mainly focus on testing the change of the result set w.r.t the change of 0010 and 001 over our default uncertain Mushroom dataset. We denote the set of the final result as FR and the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets as TI. We use precision which equals FR TI FR and recall which equals FR TI TI to measure the approximate effect. Moreover, it is hard to get the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets due to #P-hard complexity. Thus, we use the result set when 0010 0.01 and 001 0.01 as true result set Fig. 11 \(a\ows that the change of precision and recall when 0010 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 001 equals 0.1. We observe that the recall keeps s teady, but precision decreases with 0010 increasing. Because the number of sampling in the ApproxFCP algorithm equals 2 42 ln n 000H\000G  the number of sampling will decrease significantly with 0010 increasing. Moreover 001  equals 0.1, probabilistic confidence degree is also fixed. Thus the number of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps steady and recall also remain stable. Similarly, Fig. 11 \(b shows the case where 001 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 0010  equals 0.1. Because 001 only influences the number of sampling on ln 2  000G times, recall is affected slightly and precision also remains stable. To sum up, above results demonstrate that our approximation algorithm has a good approximation quality  a  Varying 0010 b  Varying 001  Fig. 11 Approximation Quality in Mushroom  D  Algorithm Framework Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the efficiencies of the depthfirst search-based and breadth-fi rst search-based strategies Fig. 12\(a\hows the running time of two search solutions while min_sup varies from 0.2 to 0.6 and other parameters are

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
