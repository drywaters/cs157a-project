Most works in mining association rules produces a large number of rules which are almost non-interesting to the user. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which uses the concept of lower bounding distance and ontology to mine and post-mine the rules respectively. This paper defines a matching operator for rule selection  Th e matching operator selects the time stamped association rule that matches with the user-specified constraint. The experimental results show that the execution time is reduced when compared with the traditional mining method. Also the number of rules is greatly reduced when the matching operator is used. Our approach will help t he decision maker to analyze the results effectively Ke ywords-Time stamped association rule, ontology, userconstraint template, matching operator  I  INTRODUCTION Database Mining has attracted a growing amount of attention in database communities due to its wide applicability in various fields where vast amounts of data are collected every day. One major application domain of data mining is in the analysis of transactional data. It is assumed that the database system keeps information about user transactions, where each transaction is a collection of data items. An association rule captures the notion of a set of data items occurring together in transactions. In recent days the time related data come up in a variety of domains such as stock market analysis, medical data, environmental data financial data and the analysis of the usage of web pages by different users at different time slots. In [1 2 3  t h ey have paid attention to time-related information, which is implicitly related to transaction data, e.g., the time that a transaction is executed, and discovered association patterns that vary over time Jin Soun g  Yoo a n d Shas hi She k a r  has proposed an algorithm called SPAMINE\(SimilarityProfiled temporal Association MINing mEthod\ich mines similar patterns that co-occurs with a particular event over time. It defines tight upper and lower bounds of true support sequences to estimate support sequences without examining an input data set. For early pruning of candidate item sets they utilized the concept of a lower bounding distance, which is often used for indexing schemes in the time series literature and defined the lower bounding distance which further reduces itemset search space. However, they do not mine association rules As we know, association rules helps the decision makers to analyze the mining results effectively, our work focuses on mining timestamped association rules. The work of Agarwal and Srikanth [5 dis c ov er s as socia t i o n r u l e s and  it has been extensively studied in 7  8  and 9   The u s e  of monotonicity property of support used to prune candidate itemsets is proposed in [5 n  4 they h a ve pro pose d t h e monotonicity property of lower bounding distance which is more effective in pruning the candidate itemsets. In our approach, we use the pruning techniques as suggested by Yoo and Shashi in the process of mining timestamped association rules. Most of the existing algorithms generate huge volume of association rules, where most of the mined rules are less interesting to the user. For example, in a market basket analysis, the use of traditional association mining algorithm i sco v er s the as socia t i on be tween a l l  th e i t e m s  in the dataset. But if the data miner is interested only in analyzing the sale of confectionery items, he would be frustrated by the enormous amount of other rules which are not useful for his analysis. So, it is crucial to devise a scheme which helps the decision maker to do his analysis based on his constraints. Ontology is a formal representation of the knowledge by a set of concepts within a domain \(eg Supermarket\and the relationships between those concepts eg. Confectionery items in supermarket\. It is used to reason about the properties of that domain, and may be used to describe the domain. Fig. 1 shows the example of a supermarket domain with its concepts in a hierarchical manner  Figu re 1  Example of Domain Ontology I n this paper, we propose an approach to mine timestamped association rules and to select interesting association rules from huge volume of discovered rules. This approach consists of two phases. In the first phase, we use pruning techniques proposed in  to r e du ce the i t e m s e t 149 ___________________________________ 978-14244 8679-3  11 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE 


search space of candidate items. In the second phase timestamped association rules can be discovered from the pruned candidate itemsets. Furthermore, from the discovered rules, user interesting rules are discovered using the concept of domain ontology which integrates user knowledge[10 The complexity of the user knowledge can be represented more effectively using ontology. We propose an approach called user-constraint template which allows the dataminer to select the interesting relationship between the concepts. A matching operator is defined over the user-constraint template in order to describe the actions that the user can perform. This operator is used to select the rules that are interesting to the data miner. The mining results can improve supply chain planning and retail decision making for maximizing the visibility of items most likely to be in high demand during special time periods  II  RELATED  WO RK In the literature, several methods have been examined for mining and post mining association rules. To our knowledge there is no method that post mines temporal association rules using the concept of ontology. Cyclic association rule mining which detects periodically repetitive patterns of frequent item sets over time has been examined by Ozde c associations can be considered as item sets that occur in every cycle with no exception. The work of Ozden  was extended by Ramaswam  f o r  r e l a xed mat ches. L i  Ni ng Wang and Ja pl ored the p r oble m  of find i n g  frequent item sets along with calendar-based patterns. The calendar-based patterns are defined with a calendar schema e.g., \(year, month, and day\. For example, \(*, 12, 25 represents the set of time points each corresponding to the 25th day of December. However, real-life patterns are usually imperfect and may not demonstrate any regular periodicity. In the work of a te m poral pat tern i s  defined with the set of time points where the user expects discovered item sets to be frequent t e m p o r a l pa tt er ns are searched with a user defined numeric reference sequence and consider the prevalence similarities of all possible item sets, not only frequent item sets. Dong and Li [1  pres e n t e d  the problem of mining emerging patterns, which are item sets whose supports increase significantly from one data set to another. Liu, Hsu and d ied t h e c h ange of  fundamental association rules between two time periods using support and confidence. In contrast, our paper focuses on mining timestamped association rules. Association rule mining has been examined in the literature through many algorithms. The CLOSET algorithm was proposed in s  a new efficient method for mining closed itemsets. CLOSET uses a novel frequent pattern tree \(FP-tree\structure, which is a compressed representation of all the transactions in the database. Another solution for the reduction of the number of frequent itemsets is mining maximal frequent itemsets [1 The authors proposed the MAFIA algorithm based on depthfirst traversal and several pruning methods as Parent Equivalence Pruning \(PEP\, FHUT, HUTMFI, or dynamic recording. However, the main drawback of the methods extracting maximal frequent itemsets is the loss of information because the subset frequency is not available Thus, generating rules is not possible. Many survey papers summarize and compare the objective measure definitions and properties [17 18 Unf o r t unat el y, being r e stric ted to data evaluation, the objective measures are not sufficient to reduce the number of extracted rules and to capture the interesting ones. A very recent approach uses onto l ogy in a preprocessing step. The data set is first preprocessed according to the constraints extracted from the ontology, and then, the data mining step takes place. The difference in this approach is that, first, they apply constraints in the preprocessing task, whereas we work in the post processing task. The advantage of the pruning constraints is that it permits to exclude from the start the information that the user is not interested in, thus permitting to apply the Apriori algorithm to this new database. Let us consider that the user is not sure about which items he/she should prune. In this case, he/she should create several pruning tests, and for each test, he/she will have to apply the Apriori algorithm whose execution time is very high. Second, they use SeRQL in order to express user knowledge, and they propose a more expressive and flexible language for user expectation representation, i.e., Rule Schemas. In contrast, our approach uses user-constraint template which selects only the interesting rules III  NOTATIONS The timestamped association rule mining task can be stated as follows: Let I= {i1, i2,..in} be a finite set of items and D=D1U ÖU Dn, Di Dj i j, be a time-stamped transaction database wherein each transaction consists of a timeslot and an itemset. Let T =t1, t2..tn be the timeslots. A minimum_support sequence S= <s1, . . , sn> over time slots t1, . . tn is applied  to find the distance between each itemset and user specified threshold. Many similarity measures have been discussed in the time series database literature [2  A  Lp norm is the most popularly used distance measure in a similar time sequence searc L 2  nor m d i sta n ce  called Euclidean distance to find the candidate itemsets which satisfies the minimum_support sequence threshold at the given timeslots <t1,t2..tn IV  P O TAR  ALGORITHM    We developed PoTAR \(Post mining of Timestamped Association Rules\ algorithm for generating timestamped association rules and to select interesting rules from the generated rules. Fig. 2 shows the flow of PoTAR Algorithm Inputs I: A set of finite items D: Timestamped transaction database T: Timeslots S: Minimum_Support_Sequence E: Euclidean distance Measure U: User-specified Threshold C: Minimum_Confidence_Sequence M: Matching Operator Output User interesting timestamped association rules 150 


Steps  1  Scan the timestamped transaction database to calculate the support count of the items at different timeslots \(t 1 t 2 t n  2  Low er Bounding distance is found between support_count of each item \(at various timeslots and the minimum_support_sequence 3  If lower bounding distance user-specified threshold \(U\, the itemset is considered as the candidate itemset 4  From the candidate itemset, timestamped association rules are generated 5  In the post processing step, ontology is constructed to describe the domain in which the analysis is done 6  User-Constraint template is created to specify the interestingness of data miner 7  A matching operator \(M\ is applied over the userconstraint template to select the interesting rules  Figure 2   Flow of PoTAR Algorithm V  FRAMEW ORK  DESCRI PTION The proposed approach is composed of two main phases The first phase includes the generation of support_counts of itemsets at each timeslot and candidate itemsets. The second phase involves mining of association rules from candidate items and post mining of association rules using ontology and user constraint template to guarantee user interesting rules  A  Mining Candidate Itemsets \(Steps 1-3 The time stamped transaction database is scanned using the lattice-dominant scan method [4  which r eads a  whole transaction data set from time slot t1 to time slot tn for calculating the support_count of each item. The cost of computing the support_counts of all combinations of itemsets at each timeslot increases with increase in the number of items. Hence, to reduce the computational cost the interesting properties like tight upper and lower bounds of support_counts of single items [4 are used. I t is then  used  to estimate support_count of itemsets at each timeslot without examining an input data set. The upper bound and lower bound support_counts at each time slot indicates the range in which the true support_count of an itemset can be located. The lower bounding distance is used in the pruning of candidate item sets. The lower bounding distance is the sum of lower lower bounding distance and the upper lower bounding distance. The lower bounding distance is the distance between the support_count sequence\(X\and the minimum_support_sequence\(S\ and is calculated using the following equation D lb S, X D llb S, C  ulb  S, X\, where                      \(1 D llb S, X     2  D ul b S, X   3  S t repres ents the minimum_support_sequence at timeslot t xl t  represents the lower bound support count sequence at timeslot t, and xu t r epresents the upper bound support count sequence at timeslot t. If the lower bounding distance of an item set does not satisfy the user-specified threshold, then it is pruned from the candidate itemsets Pruning Techniques a. The upper lower bounding distance of any subset of a candidate item set is found using \(3\d if it does not satisfy the user-specified threshold, then the candidate item set is pruned using the nondecreasing monotonicity property of upper lower bounding distance b. The lower bounding distance of an itemset is found using 1\ if it does not satisfy the user-specified threshold, the candidate can be eliminated without examining the data set c. The upper lower-bounding distance to the true support_count sequence of an item set is found and if it does not satisfy the threshold, the item set is not involved in generating the next size candidates As a result of applying these pruning techniques, the total number of candidates generated is reduced considerably  B. Generation and Post mining of Association Rules \(Steps 4-7 To generate timestamped association rule   For each candidate itemset l, generate all non-empty subsets of l. If the itemset is a single item there is no possibility of generating association rules   For every non-empty subset s of l, generate a rule of the form s=>l-s if support_count \(l\ort_count\(s\ \(at each time slot min_conf_sequence threshold.\(min_conf_sequence is a sequence of confidence values over different time slots The above steps to generate timestamped association rules can discover a prohibitive amount of association rules For instance, when the number of attributes and the number of transactions becomes large, thousands of rules are extracted from a database. As the number of rules become huge, it is difficult for the data miner to analyze the mining results. Also it is impossible to use the results. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker with an efficient technique for reducing the number of rules. The interestingness of the rule strongly depends on interactivity with the user [2 151 


Existing methods do not guarantee that interesting rules can be extracted. To select the interesting rule, the user knowledge should be expressed in an accurate and understandable form. In data mining, background knowledge ontology organizes domain knowledge and plays important roles at several levels of the knowledge discovery process Fig. 3 shows the construction of ontology for the supermarket domain. Ontology provides an explicit representation of concepts in a domain, where each concept is a collection if items. Instance of a concept represents the ground level items  Figure 3  Ontology based on supermarket example The subsumption relation between concepts shows the isa superclass of, is-a subclass of relations. The conceptinstance relation represents the relation between concepts and the instances.  There are two types of concepts: leafconcepts and generalized concepts from the subsumption relation Leaf-concepts are connected in the easiest way to databaseóeach concept is associated to one item in the database. Generalized concepts are described as the concepts that subsume other concepts in the ontology. A generalized concept is connected to the database through its subsumed concepts. The Rule Schema formalism is based on the specification language for user knowledge introduced by Liu The model proposed by Liu is described using elements from an item taxonomy allowing an is-a organization of database attributes. Using item taxonomies has many advantages: the representation of user expectations is more general, and thus filtered rules are more interesting for the user. However taxonomy of items might not be enough. The user might want to use concepts that are more expressive and accurate But, ontology includes the features of taxonomies and provides more representation power. In a taxonomy, only the subsumption relationship is used to build the hierarchy Thus, a taxonomy is simply a hierarchical categorization or classification of items in a domain. In contrast, an ontology is a specification of several characteristics of a domain defined using an open vocabulary. So, data miner develops an ontology on the items in database. An user-constraint template is defined which allows the data miner to select interesting rules according to his constraints. The userconstraint template can be represented in the following way UC<confectionery_items=>grocery_items We propose a matching operator for rule selection. The matching operator \(M\ selects the timestamped association rule that matches with the user-specified constraint. When the matching operator is applied over user-constraint template M \(UC\he antecedent and the consequent of the timestamped association rules should match Thus by using PoTAR algorithm, we can say that the generated timestamped association rules are useful and interesting  VI  EXPERIMENTAL  E VALUATION A  EXPERIMENT DATASET Our experiments were performed with a synthetic timestamped transaction dataset T1000_AT100_I100_P50_AP5.db\ted using TAR to use the f o llowin g par a m e ters t o character i z e  the synthetic data sets we used. T is the total number of transactions \(10,000\I is the number of distinct items 100\, S is the average size of transactions \(10\, and Tí is the number of time slots. A reference time sequence was generated by choosing randomly a support sequence of an item set B  EXPERIMENT RESULTS The association rules generated from the similar itemsets is compared with that of the rules generated from Apriori Algorithm. The pruning techniques used in this paper proved to be more effective than the monotonicity property of support used in it. Since the lower bounding distance of upper and lower bound support sequences are used, the number of candidate itemsets generated is reduced considerably. Thus it results in the reduction of execution time for the generation of timestamped association rules. It is shown in the graph cited in Fig. 4.It shows that the overall execution time of traditional association rule mining technique is more when compared with our approach Table. 1 shows the comparison of number of interesting rules selected when matching operator is  Figu re 4  Evaluation of execution time w.r.t no. of items ap plied over user-constraint template and when not applied The No. represents the five different constraints that are 152 


given to select different set of interesting rules.Our Experimental evaluation proves that the rules generated are timestamped and the selected rules are interesting to the user TABLE I  C OMPARISON OF THE N UMBER OF R ULES WITH AND WITHOUT A PPLYING M ATCHING O PERATOR    VII   CONCLUSION This paper discusses the problem of mining timestamped association rules at each time slot and postmines for discovering user interesting rules. The rules discovered displays the association between the items that have the similar support during a particular event. Furthermore, the discovered rules are pruned by using ontology and user constraint template to help the decision maker to analyze the results effectively ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Ms.S.Geetha Asst.Professor of Karunya University for her encouragement and support in this work REFERENCES 1  B Ozden, S.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF IMPROVED ALGORITHM The algorithm introduced in this paper can greatly improve the mining efficiency. Firstly, the improved scan the database only once; secondly, it reduces a lot of unnecessary operations. The Improved mining algorithm has lower time complexity as it has explicit object. We test the traditional algorithm and the improved one based on the same situation that all the data are from Table I, and lead to the results showed on Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 showed that improved algorithm improved a lot on time. When it comes to the case that the transaction database is huge and the bigger interested items, the improved algorithm runs much better.

A. Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED [10] is based upon the idea of transforming one hierarchy into another via certain local editing operations The distance between two hierarchies is the minimum total number of operations needed for transforming the one into the other. Three modification operations are considered: A node i is deleted by transmitting its children to its parent and removing i from the hierarchy. Inserting is the complement of deleting: Inserting i as a child of j makes i the parent of some subset of the children of j. Changing a node means changing its label. In order to make computation in polynomial time possible, the constraint that disjoint subtrees have to be mapped to disjoint subtrees is included in the definition [10], [16 The original definition does not include any normalization For two hierarchies with q labels each, 2q is the highest possible CTED  corresponding to deleting all labels of the first hierarchy and inserting all labels of the second hierarchy We normalize the CTED by 12q which results in distances in 0, 1 B. Taxonomic Overlap TO [11] compares the nodes of two hierarchies according to how many ancestors and descendants they share. We describe a version adapted to our experiments. Define semantic cotopy as SC\(i,H i j Given two hierarchies H1 and H2, the corresponding overlap for i ? L is defined as O\(i,H1, H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 Note that this is a symmetric expression in H1 and H2 with values in [0, 1]. The TO of H1 and H2 is the average of all overlaps TO\(H1, H2 1 q  i?L O\(i,H1, H2 For two identical hierarchies, TO is 1, while it is 0 if H1 and H2 are totally unrelated. Since the two other hierarchy 


proximity measures used in the experiments are distances with smaller values indicating higher similarity TO? := 1? TO to simplify comparisons C. LCA-Path Tree Distance Since in a hierarchy a parent is a more general concept than any of its children, the locations of the same label i in two hierarchies H1 and H2 can be compared by how far one has to travel up the chain of ancestors in both hierarchies until a common ancestor is found. For a label i ? L the depth dH\(i 0 dH\(i pH\(i a1, . . . , av the ancestors of i in H1, such that a1 = pH1\(i a2 = pH1\(a1 i common ancestor of i in H1 and H2, lca\(i,H1, H2 first ancestor of i in H1 which is also an ancestor of i in H2 j? := min  j | j ? {1, . . . , v} such that aj ? AH2\(i  lca\(i,H1, H2 Since 0 is an ancestor of all labels in all hierarchies, the LCA always exists. Note that usually lca\(i,H1, H2 lca\(i,H2, H1 We use the LCA to measure how far apart the positions of a label in both hierarchies are: If a label i has the same parent in both hierarchies it is regarded as being in the same position, otherwise the distances of i to its LCA in both hierarchies are used to measure how far apart both locations are. The cost for i is defined as d\(i,H1, H2 2 k=1 dHk\(i lca\(i,H1, H2 D\(i,H1, H2  0, if pH1\(i i d\(i,H1, H2 8 This can be seen as the length of the path from i to lca\(i,H1, H2 i,H1, H2 As D is not symmetric, the complete LCA-path distance

Comparison All three hierarchy proximity measures presented above reflect different concepts of tree similarity. It is thus not surprising that CTED and TO*, although they perform well in the domains they were designed for, may produce counterintuitive results when used in the field of HE. This is demonstrated by the hierarchies shown in Figure 3: Despite the fact that the relationships between the nodes in both hierarchies are completely different, their CTED and TO are 0.33 and 0.44, respectively. Their LCAPD, on the other hand, is 1.00. Thus only LCAPD marks both hierarchies with the highest possible distance Some hierarchies used in our experiments contain nodes with exactly one child \(single-child labels that TO* does not distinguish between such labels and their children, in the following sense: Given a hierarchy H and a single-child node i, we denote with H ? the hierarchy 


that is obtained from H by swapping i and its child. Then TO?\(H,H CTED or LCAPD V. EXPERIMENTS We tested the proposed data mining system with four multi-label classifiers: ML-FAM, ML-ARAM, ML-kNN and BoosTexter on three real-world datasets with increasing complexity from the text-mining field. In our experiments we compared extracted hierarchies to the original hierarchy by means of three hierarchy proximity measures: LCAPD CTED, and TO The experimental setup of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM had the following parameter values: choice parameter 0.0001; learning rates ?a,b = 1.0 for fast learning; vigilance parameters ?a = 0.9 and ?b = 1.0. The parameter t was chosen to be 0.05 for the 20 newsgroups dataset and 0.02 for the other datasets. The number of voters V was set to 9 Following [8], we used 10 nearest neighbors \(k = 10 Laplace smoothing \(s = 1 BoosTexter was trained using 500 boosting rounds as in 8] and the threshold for converting rankings into multi-labels was set to 0 [9 A. Multi-label Classification Performance Measures We used a large set of performance measures for evaluation of the MC experiments: First, two example-based measures for multi-label predictions: Accuracy \(A measure \(F  of the predicted labels are actually present while F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall calculated on the per-instance basis. The larger the A and F values, the better the MC performance Then two label-based measures were calculated on the basis of binary counts for each label: the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives We used the micro-averaged version of F1 with the binary measures counted on the whole test set. The perfect performance corresponds to F1 = 1. Additionally, micro-averaged precision and recall were used for computing the Area Under a Precision-Recall Curve \(AUPRC  precision corresponds to the proportion of predicted labels in the test set that are correct and recall to the proportion of labels that are correctly predicted. AUPRC has been claimed 


to be a well-suited performance measure for MC tasks where the number of negative instances significantly exceeds the number of positive instances [6]. Another advantage of AUPRC is its global nature and independence of a certain threshold value. The closer the AUPRC value is to 1, the better the performance Since these measures are based on the comparison of multi-labels, they depend on a transformation from rankings to classes. As a contrast we also used four wellknown ranking-based performance measures: One-Error OE RL C cision \(AP  for all ranking-based performance measures except AP. OneError evaluates how many times the top-ranked label is not in the set of proper labels of the instance. Ranking Loss is defined as the average fraction of pairs of labels that are ordered incorrectly. Coverage evaluates how far we need, on average, to go down the list of labels in order to cover all the proper labels of the instance. Average Precision evaluates the average fraction of labels ranked above a particular label i ? mt which actually are in mt And finally, the special hierarchical loss function H-loss 2] were utilized. Following [3], normalized costs were calculated: ci := 1/|c\(p\(i i ? L i of all direct children of i. Hierarchical loss \(H-loss consider mistakes made in subtrees of incorrectly predicted labels and penalizes only the first mistake along the path from the root to a node. The smaller the H-loss value, the better the performance B. 20 Newsgroups Dataset We modified the popular single-label dataset 20 Newsgroups [18], [19] by considering eight additional labels corresponding to the intermediate levels of the hierarchy faith, recreation, recreation/sport, recreation/vehicles, politics, computer, computer/hardware, science. This dataset is a collection of almost 20,000 postings from 20 newsgroups sorted by date into training \(60 40 data were preprocessed by discarding all words appearing only in the test documents and all words found in the stop word list [20]. Afterwards, all but the 2%-most-frequent words were eliminated to reduce the dimensionality. Documents were represented using the well-known TF-IDF \(Term 


Frequency  Inverse Document Frequency scheme [19]. The TF-IDF weights were then normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Conversion to TF-IDF and normalization were performed separately for training and test data. This resulted in the 1,070-dimensional dataset with 11,256 training instances, 7,493 test ones and 28 labels To test the performance of two HE algorithms, we first extracted hierarchies from the True Test Multi-Labels \(TTML and calculated the corresponding proximity measures. Both algorithms successfully extracted the original hierarchy We studied the performance of the multi-label classifiers and their ability to infer the class hierarchies in the presence of only partly available hierarchical information. We performed a series of HE experiments with multi-labels having a decreasing number of inserted non-leaf labels describing the levels in the hierarchy. We randomly removed such labels from 20%, 30%, and 40% of the training instances leaving them single-labeled. The results for predicted test multilabels are shown in Table I where the bold face marks the best classifier, and the first column \(left result of HE by Voting and the second \(right Thresholding \(referred as GT Comparing classification performance, one can see that the ART-based networks are superior to both the other classifiers in terms of most performance measures and that ML-FAM slightly outperforms ML-ARAM. Taken together they win on at least 6 and at most 8 out of 9 evaluation measures. BoosTexter has the second best performance, but its predictive power degrades more quickly with the increase in the number of single-label instances. The poorest MC results were shown by ML-kNN, its performance decreased very fast with any reduction in the number of multi-labels For example, F1 decreased by 15% while removing 40% of labels instead of 30%. It is also interesting to note that when trained on the dataset with 40% removed labels, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM significantly outperformed ML-kNN trained on the original dataset with all labels The hierarchy proximity measures confirm the good quality of predictions produced by the ART-based networks: The hierarchies were correct extracted by both HE algorithms of Section II-B even with 40% removed labels. The predictions of ML-kNN were the worst: The Voting variant of the HE 


algorithm could not extract the correct hierarchy with 30 assigning five labels incorrectly to the root label. None of the HE algorithms could extract the correct hierarchy in the absence of 40% multi-labels. With 40% and Voting, the number of labels falsely assigned to the root was 13, while with GT it was only three. For BoosTexter, Voting assigned two labels wrongly to the root label in the experiment with TABLE I 20 NEWSGROUPS ALL, -20%, -30% AND -40% RESULTS Measure all 20% 30% 40%ARAM FAM kNN BoosT.

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the 


root label in the hierarchies of the ART networks.

All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
