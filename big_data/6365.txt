The 'education in the cloud' mainly consists of video clips trying to repeat the classroom experience recorded before the old-fashioned blackboard only nowadays it is white\ where professor is presenting the same lecture what he presented in lecture hall, only now lectures are cut into 5-10 min video clips the mobile approach'. Is this why the old lecture halls are still needed Rapidly increasing costs of University Education, increasing competition of educational entrepreneurs and constant increase of population of working students have made clear that both sides of University education teaching/learning and accrediting, giving diplomas need changes. University Education should more take into account students informal and non-formal learning, their participation in professional work both in organization of study and in certification In the following are considered several aspects of current situation, presented practices which authors use when teaching IT students and examined possible changes in universities teaching and certification methods I I NTRODUCTION Advancements in technology are constantly reshaping our teaching/learning training practices In last 10..15 years, the biggest influence for educational practice have had computers and Internet Technologies IT and their role is increasing, especially for delivering training. The impact of IT to education was characterized in developed countries already in 15 years from now as the ëe-Learning Revolution    7  Currently the E-learning revolution has started or is starting even in rural Africa 8  w h ile de ve l o ped countries have already embraced the M-learning revolution [9  o u r c l a s sroo m s  ha ve be co m e  c l o u d y   1 0    11  a nd s o m e a r e m o ving classr oo m s into b o x e s    the classroom in a boxí\ [12   1 3    Technology and buzz-words around it have changed rapidly. But disparity between what goes into higher education and what many get out of it are not always encouraging Greek writer Aristophanes complained already more than 2,000 years ago in his comedy 'The Clouds' [14   tha t  universities \('Thinkeries with quacks'\left students heavily indebted and without practica l skills Clouds, the 'patron goddesses of thinkers and other layabouts' arrives in the comedy singing majestically and promising with teachings from professor 'Inferior Argument' earthly 'summum bonum' and a life of ease and pleasure, typical of men who know how to talk their way out of trouble Headings indicate, that lit tle has changed during the last 2000 years, except that youth less and less believes that professors can lead them to life of ease and pleasure   Student Loan Problems: One Third Of Millennials Regret Going To College 1   Graduate data reveal Englandís lost and indebted generation  16   Todayís College Graduates: In Debt and Unable to Find a Job 1  The forerunner of the computer revolution in education has been USA - very innovative country, the very birthplace of computers, PC, the iPad and also initiator of application of computers in education MIPRO 2014, 26-30 May 2014, Opatija, Croatia 616

But at the same time those minds, their ways of life are also rapidly changing and these changes happen quicker than changes in big systems - in universities, in the whole European Higher Education Area [23  Learning occurs constantly from cradle to grave In 1996 the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development \(OECD\ member states agreed to develop lifelong learning strategy, which includes formal, nonformal and informal learning [2  25  The formal learning is highly structured and implemented by specialized organizations - schools Formal learning is intentional, schools and learners have explicit objectives covering knowledge, skills and competences, what learner should get Informal learning is learning from life experience language acquisition, accepting cultural norms and social behavior This is happening all the time, everywhere and is not intentional nor organized With development of society everything becomes more organized, thus also learning which happens not in schools tends to be organized An example are Massive Open On-Line Courses \(MOOC\, which are rapidly gaining popularity, e.g. the Kh an Academy [2 p r ov id es  every month online lessons for more than 10 million visitors from about 200 c ountries Organized outside school' learning is by OECD terminology non-formal learning. This kind of learning is very accessible lessons/videos can be followed even on iPhone, iPad or Android phones [27  Wh i l e t h e f i rs t  MOOC  U da ci t y   Codeacademy, Khan Academy\ were focused on math computer programming and computer science currently MOOC are providing very broad selection of courses and new providers appear constantly. Even the World Economic Forum WEF announced at its last meeting about launch of its Forum Academy, where the huge network of industry leaders and opinion-makers of WEF will make their expertise and visions available to the global audience   All these 'educational entrepreneurs' are directly moving into universities playground - several already provide accreditations. Currently they are mostly just for participation. But this is comparable with universities participating seat time' is in universities also often considered as something that gives students 'deeper understanding' \(whatever this is\ thus as a base for passing a course, although a correct mark were "Great Listener - constantly gave a nod of assent Many university apparatchik's are doing everything in their power to make sure that universities continue to function the way they have. The notable difference is steady increase in the number of universities non-teaching staff, e.g. in the flagship St anford University, USA - 3-5 every year 29 th e f i rs t  T h i n k e ri e w ith qu a c k s    Socrates, managed to shepherd his disciples to 'earthly summum bonum' alone And the academic staff should produce more and more bubbls' \('bubblications' - many are very soft inside Universities consider the fo rmal learning as the only real' learning and want to continue in traditions of the Bologna university dating back to 1088. But students learn more and more in spheres of non-formal, informal learning, acquire skills and appreciation in many professional\ social networks Universities should find a way to consider all these tendencies III.S TUDENTS Today's students are different from what they were five years ago and in the next year they will be even more different. Young people accept changes, especially new technology, much easier than their peers in universities Today's students are multitasking and collaborative they're constantly connected and use multiple devices for being connected. They're highly visual and experiential they're action- and just-in-time-oriented They value highly their time, since most of them work often full-time Students are worldwide increasingly participating in work life, e.g. the U.S. Cens us report indicated that 71 percent of college undergraduates and 82 percent of graduate students were working in 2011 [30  I n  E s t o ni a and in Finland, more than two-thirds of students are employed The official statistics possibly do not indicate the real percentage, since e.g. for an IT student it is very easy to work e.g. create www-sites from home or even from computer class at university and not to indicate \(for taxation\ all sources of income When the first author asked students in Feb 2014 his group \(83 IT specialty first year students\ in the opening lecture, all students indicated, that they work. Even the academic time-tables have been already for several years adjusted for working students - some weekdays are free, but on some days lectures/exercises end at 21.00 Research results indicate, that working does not reduce academic achievements  32   ev en c o n t ra ry w o rk in g  students are more organized, value their time and manage to achieve good results in th eir studies. This clearly shows in their behavior in lectures and exercises - they never just sit there, they are very active and want to get maximum what teacher can provide Besides Facebook and Google accounts they have accounts in LinkedIn, StackOverflow Quora, Scribd and in many other professional topicoriented social networks If they want to solve a pr oblem, learn something then they ask in on-line professional forums Some are already answering professional questions posed by others and thus earning the appreciation. And for courses which they just want to pass, they share their essays, presentations 617 


laboratory exercises, answers to test questions etc in online databases like "Ucionica.hr je banka znanja na internetu" [33  or   3 4  the E s t o nian ve r s i o n   In these professional social networks they learn a lot and their knowledge in some areas connected with their work exceeds that of their professors in the university The generations X \(the ìlostî generation, some of them still study\ and Y \(Millennials\[35   3 6 g r o w  w ith Internet and have developed different techniques for solving their problems  googling The first thing they do in computer class they start Google and whatever problem with e.g programming languages syntax - they google, and usually get necessary piece of knowledge already from the Google's page of results, without opening any page from there. This is a very useful habit and allows them quickly start using new applications nowadays everything changes very quickly and it is pointless to try to memorize all UI/syntax details  hacking They read program code much quicker than older generations \(their peers\ and grasp instantly the general structure, the information flow of a program what is imported/input, what is exported/output and understanding of the structure allows them make modifications without even reading the whole text of the program - another very useful technique in our quickly changing world Role of every kind of non-formal and informal learning and non-academic techniques is increasing and universities have not yet found adequate responses. As a result the millennials increas ingly question the value of university education A PhD students of the first author complained after successful defense, that in employment interviews several reviewers suggested him to remove mention of his PhD degree from his Curriculum Vitae - he looked 'over-educated'. His interests and  practice before entering doctorate was management of IT projects. But there were no IT projects waiting for managers - all IT projects were invented \(with financial help from the Ministry of Economy or crowd sourcing\ to be managed by similarly desperate project managers \(and most failed IV.C AN T ECHNOLOGY R EPLACE T EACHERS  Education is a rather expensive sector in every government budget. In Finl and expenses for education during the last ten years have been over 13%; in Estonia around 12 37 S o it i s unde r s t a ndab l e, that  governments want to reduce this item of expenses suggesting use of more technology in schools, which should make  teachers more effective or replace them Attempts of using technology for educating masses have long history. Already in 1920's started in USA educational radio broadcasts; later appeared educational TV, the PLATO - Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations \(Automatic Teaching!\ and currently MOOC. But all these ventures show very low course completion rates, e.g. the study from University of Pennsylvania revealed, that in average MOOC courses complete only 4% of users The number of on-line educational materials is growing exponentially. Most of them are short \(5-10min videos Most of these videos try to repeat the classroom experience and have been created in traditional style of university lectures - a 'speaking head'- style video, where professor reads chapters from his own textbook occasionally jotting some hard to understand handwritten characters/figures/schemas on the blackboard \(modern professors have already whiteboard Video is far less interactiv e than printed book. With book user can slip pages, look for references, skip uninteresting sections, with video one has to follow everything with video's speed. This breaks the fundamental principle of UI \(User Interface\ design: user not the computer, should always have control. Videos cannot have links to outside materials and user can not copy-paste formulae or data from a video Video clips exploit very little of human's audio-visual capabilities Bandwidth of human eye's is ca 10 Mbps million bits per second \39 ea rs  1.4 M b p s  i  e  w e  receive every second ca 11.4 Mb of information Bandwidth of educational video clips e.g. in YouTube is on average only 4500 kbps \(everyone can check - rightclick on clip and select 'Stats for nerds'\, thus these clips engage only a quarter of our input capacity. But a weaker signal creates also weaker perceptions   Figure 1 Sensory \(visual+audio\ signals are in classroom lecture many times stronger than in educational video from WWW Video lectures are for many more difficult to comprehend than the actual textbook which has been used if there are formulae or data which user should write down, there are references to topics which are not covered in this particular lecture - from video user can not copypaste and video does not support links. The widely used by universities simultaneous re ading the slide text with voice \('speaking head'\ is useful only for users with reading disabilities, for other users it makes text comprehension more difficult 41  a lth o ugh s o m e  research claims for different age group the opposite [42    Figure 2 Speaking head' reading the text of 20 slides. User should watch for 10min 47sec,  in order to get the data and formulae, user 618 


should pause the video and manually wrote everything down no copypaste, no links A good on-line study material should be self-contained it is easy to open another paragraph from book, but rather troublesome to find another video clip explaining missing issues. And the aim should be to explain the topic not to show the professor However, some video clips are really excellent - selfcontained, with content menu  and using the best features of digital media - animations, sound/voice examples are e.g. the Introduction to Modern Information Theory [43  from Khan Academy or the winners of the Medical College Admission Test \(MCAT\ Video Competition, a collaboration between Khan Academy, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Association of American Medical Colleges AAMC 44 A s this l a st exam p l e  shows, students can make better educational materials than professors - students know, what their fellow students need There are many educational tutorials on WWW about nearly everything. They have been created without considering traditions of university lecture, but considering audience - to whom this may be useful - and maximally utilizing latest technical possibilities of modern browsers, e.g. allow to demonstrate interaction of different parts of www-page - html code, JavaScript, CSS 45  And IT students already use these for learning far more than university lectures - lectures are for many only for getting diploma V B EST P RACTICES The technology is not the lesson presented by a live teacher The competition in \(higher\ucation is all the time becoming stronger and under the pressure of it, all teachers are seeking better practices in their teaching. The following are suggestions following from our everyday practices A Activate, engage students Getting students and professors together in a lecture room is an effort which has a cost - both students and professor's time, the lecture room etc. This time should not be wasted to make students passive listeners of oracle who is \(often\ reading passages from his own book and who \(often\ has never tried to implement his recipes in some real business enterprise The advancement in communication technology have made such sessions of passive listening utterly senseless Students could listen/watch these sermons online. The precious time when the whole group and professor are face-to-face should be used actively Many studies have shown, that learning is effective only when students are actively engaged in the learning process. Thus the first what lecturer should do is Engage, activate students, make them active participants, make a lecture/practice active dialog instead of one-sided sermon  B The Flipped classroom University education is a rare \(probably only\ field of social activity which has nearly not changed from the times when first universities appeared in 11th..12th centuries - many of th em are still active [46   Proud of longevity and academic traditions professors continue to deliver lectures nearly the same way as did their predecessors during centuries: top-down, deductively first the lecture explaining theory and then some examples and exercises illustra ting the theory. This is the test-oriented method of teaching - tell students exactly what students need to know for the test, nothing more nothing less In order to acquire knowledge and not simply to pass tests gives the inductive,  problem-based learning discovery learning, inquiry learning much better results than deductive [47 L e arning s h o u ld sta r t f r o m a c a se  a  problem, a story what students can understand. This is  the Scahnk's  story-based teaching method [48   An often used tradition is to assign at the end of a lecture readings for home. But usually teachers discover at the start of the next lecture, that nobody has done their readings. Thus instead of continuous crying "How to get them to Do the Readings maybe it is time to ask whether this tradition should be changed. The essential knowledge, which earlier was assigned as home readings after a lection, should be discussed in class, but in order the discussion to be successful, students should first do some exercises from on-line tutorials, where are assigned on-line materials which present theory C Use on-line materials and video clips Teachers should use the best examples of the vast and rapidly growing pool of freely \(still!\ available materials It has no sense to invent the bicycle or to sit a long evening trying to compile an animation for your next lecture, which will run in couple of seconds. There are already lot of ready ma terial on-line - use it D Hackers style The most influential figures in modern computing world - Bill Gates Steve Jobbs Mark Zuckerberg and others where college drop-outs. Instead of theories they wanted to 'see how this thing works Understanding the general, 'top-down' structure, flow of information in a program or a system is a very valuable ability, which allows quickl y to understand new systems and programs \(and currently they appear nearly every day\. Many students already possess this ability - they see instantly, where is a closing bracket of a block or function which lines have syntax errors etc. For instance, when the first author showed in class program lines which caused the recent Apple's SSL/TLS bug 49 se v e r a l s t ud e n ts quic kly indicated the erroneous line. Many university teachers consider such 'top-down' style as 'non-serious and even dangerous, but rapid increase of new systems and technologies makes this approach inevitable  everyone want first to see how it works how it can be used and only if it can be used\  what are the details The quick advancement of HTML5 is due just to its openness everyone can investigate, 'how this works E Give students more choise In his commencement speech Steve Jobbs described his decision to drop out from college it was one of the 619 


best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting Students, especially working students, are well aware of developments in their field, since companies follow all the time, what is happening in their field - this determines their success or failure. They should have more freedom in selecting courses, for visiting or not visiting lectures and presenting their projects for credits. The rigid division to semesters and sessions is very questionable, e.g why can teacher assess the achievements of a student only in pre-determined time, during the examination session? The marks go to university's database \(the Studies Information System\; this system runs like all server databases 7/24, so should also be accessible 7/24 Some universities are already experimenting with more flexible practices, e.g the Rio Salado College in Arizona allows for a semester 48 start times in a year [50    VI E XAMPLE CASE Some of relevant practices are illustrated in the following with a brief overview of first author's exercise class in theme 3D communication in spring 2014 Participants were first year bachelor students, this was the semester's first exercise and the exercise was the first step for creating 3D web shop wi ndow, where customers could freely manipulate 3D objects A Story In 2008 appeared in Apple on-line store for iOS applications an app, which showed on screen a glowing gem with some lines of verse I'm rich...\; the application was described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all i.e. just a picture\ prize - 999.99 USD. During the first day eight people bought it then Apple removed the app [51  The story noticeably enlivened students and they started to create an enormous \(1m x 1m x 1m diamond, which they could expose rotating on their wwwsites using the html5/WebGL the result: [52   B Using on-line tutorials The 3d model was created with Sketchup students followed the YouTube tutorial [53   C Gamification The indicated tutorial \(and the following steps\ could be improved, thus students were encouraged to propose improvements. The 3D model was improved with creating an additional upper bevel with author's initials not part of on-line tutorial Figure 3 Upper bevel and author's initials Those, who could propose improvements to the tutorial, could implement the additional bevel and remove unnecessary hidden surfaces earned credits - +-points which will be considered in course final assessment D Hacking The 3D- model was transformed in Collada format to html5 document. For this was quickly 3-5 minutes introduced the Javascript WebGl package three.js 54   The whole package is > 200 MB, therefore students copied to assigned to them hard disk area only some files first the examples/webgl_loader_collada.html and all files needed to run them in browser \(they had to investigate the Javascript import clauses and create a corresponding directory structure\. When the monster from webgl_loader_collada.html become alive, they had to create a directory parallel with monster's directory export there from Sketchup their precious stone in Collada format and replace the monster's import with import of their Collada object. For additional points they had first to replace rotation of the world with rotation of the stone only; better students could also add camera control hacking the file examples/misc_controls_orbit.html After 90 min \(end of the class\ all students succeeded in creating the rotating stone in html5 page Those, who did not understand everything, had to consider at home everything from the www-tutorial \(the 'flipped classroom VII F UTURE OF TECHNOLOGIES It is very difficult to predict - changes are all the time accelerating. However, most technologies have up to now followed the Gartner's Technology Hype development stadiums, which illustrates utilization of emerging technologies [55    Peak of Inflated expectations Through of Disillusionment Slope of Enlightenment Plateau of productivity Visibility Peak of Inflated expectations Through of Disillusionment Slope of Enlightenment Plateau of productivity Visibility Maturit y Maturit y Figure 4 The Technology Hype curve \(Gartner [55   Some of education-connected technologies are currently in the following stad iums\(for the full list check 56     On the Rise  Open Microcredits free or low-cost way to demonstrate competency in some area; some number of them could be used to obtain a certificate or diploma  58  Student Retention CRM relationship management software, which helps to identify at-risk students 620

Both of these roles - teaching and certificating - got their established forms long time ago, when world was small and closed; in our open, connected world both these functions have lot of pressure for modifications The university teaching shou ld embrace all existing tendencies for non-formal, informal education and the new skills of students googling - ability to find quickly relevant information from the World biggest data resource - Internet hacking - understanding the information flows, the essential structure of a system - an enterprise, \(local government multitasking - simultaneous ha ndling of several tasks being all the time connected  etc University teaching, distributing new knowledge should better use the rich and constantly renewing source of knowledge - Internet. Physical, i.e. publishing on paper is all the time becoming more expensive and the published materials are always first prepared in digital form - why to bother publishing on paper ? All materials are much easier to distribute and access on Internet. Scientific reports and journals, conference proceedings etc increasingly appear on-line People like to teach - creating a tutorial is the best way to understand a topic and new tutorials on newest IT application areas appear in Internet constantly. Most of them are free - the Wikipedia has been created for free Wikipedia is referential not designed for learning, but there are already many pedagogically well-designed tutorials covering many areas of IT Certification \(giving diplomas\may disappear altogether. When diploma is not any more a guarantee for earthly 'summum bonum' an d government ministers obtain their diplomas giving them 'a life of ease and pleasure' with copy-paste techniques [61  t he n - w h y to bother, spend 4-6 years under extreme strain and then when receiving the diploma discover that \(at least\half of your hardly obtained knowledge is already obsolete [62  63   Microcredentials - digital ìbadges 64 ar e increasingly respected as a representation of a credential and accepted proof of knowledge, skills or achievements  65  T h e y d i git a l   thus m u c h m o r e f o o l p r oo f th a n  classical paper diplomas.

give the deìnition of access structures in ABE systems then we introduce two types of access structures that are well used in constructing ABE schemes LSSS Structure and Access Tree Structure Deìnition 3 Access Structure  Let  P 1  P 2    P n  be a set of parties A collection A 015 2  P 1  P 2    P n  is monotone if  B  Cif B  A and B 015 C then C  A  An access structure respectively monotone access structure is a collection respectively monotone collection A of non-empty subsets of  P 1  P 2    P n   i.e A 015 2  P 1  P 2    P n      The sets in A are called the authorized sets and the sets not in A are called the unauthorized sets In attribute-based encryption scheme the role of the parties is taken by the attributes Thus the access structure A will contain the authorized sets of attributes We restrict our attention to monotone access structures A LSSS Structure Deìnition 4 Linear Secret-Sharing Schemes LSSS  A secret-sharing scheme  over a set of parties P is called linear over Z p f 1 The shares for each party form a vector over Z p  2 There exists a matrix M called the share-generating matrix for   The matrix M has l rows and n columns  Algorithm 5 AccessTree Input T  A threshold tree Input s  The secret to be shared Output a set of shares  s 1    s l  1 Let q x be a polynomial for node x  2 Set q root  0    s  3 Set degree d root   k root  1  k root is the threshold value of the root 4 Let rest of points in q root be randomly chosen 5 for all x  T do 6 Set degree of q x as d x   k x  1 7 Set q x  0  q parent  x   index  x   8 Let rest of points in q x be chosen randomly 9 end for For all i  1    l the i-th row of M is labeled by a party   i    is a function from  1    l  to P  When we consider the column vector v  s  r 2    r n   where s  Z p is the secret to be shared and r 2    r n  Z p are randomly chosen then Mv is the vector of l shares of the secret s according to   The share  Mv  i belongs to party   i   Every linear secret sharing-scheme according to the above deìnition also enjoys the linear reconstruction property Suppose that  is a LSSS for the access structure A  Let S  A be any authorized set and let I  1  2    l  be deìned as I   i    i   S   Then there exist constants  w  Z p  i  I such that for any valid shares   i  of a secret s according to  we have  i  I w i  i  s  These constants  w i  can be found in time polynomial in the size of the share-generating matrix M We note that for unauthorized sets no such constants  w i  exist B Access Tree Structure An access tree is deìned as a tree T  where every noleaf node x represents a threshold gate  k x  num x   num x is the number of its children and every leaf x is described by an attribute att  x  and a threshold value k x  The function parent  x  denotes the parent of the node x in the tree T also deìnes an ordering number for each child node and the function index  x  returns such a number associated with the node x  Policy Checking  To determine whether or not an access tree T is satisìed by a set of attributes S  the policy checking algorithm recursively computes as follows If node x is a nonleaf node it returns 1 iff at least k x children return 1 otherwise returns 0 If x is a leaf node then it returns 1 iff att  x   S  otherwise returns 0 Tree Implementing  The secret s to be shared is rst assigned to the root node of the tree by using a random polynomial q root with q root  0  s  The rest of the nodes are used to distributed this root polynomial amongst the other nodes as smaller degree polynomials as illustrated in

is 1.39 kg and the mean associated with the treatment group using the thrusters-only ACS is 2.49 kg The computed Fvalue is 16.96 which corresponds to an experimental p-value of p  3  91 002 10 000 4  Since the experimental p-value is much less than the signi\002cance threshold one can say that the data shows a statistically signi\002cant difference between the two control modes in fuel consumption This extremely low p-value is indicative of a statistical fuel savings associated with using a blended control mode This result makes physical sense because CMGs use only electrical power for maneuvering Therefore when the CMGs are being used to control attitude no thrusters are being 002red which implies that no fuel is being consumed Rejecting the null hypothesis supports the idea that a blended control mode can provide the user with a comparable experience at an average fuel savings of 45 and a maximum of 84 shown in Table 3 Table 3 226 Fuel Consumption Data Control Mode  Subject Combined RCS Only j Fuel Saved j 050kg\051 050kg\051 050%\051  1 3.07 3.49 11.89 2 0.60 1.97 69.66 3 1.32 1.81 26.89 4 1.26 1.83 31.05 5 0.65 1.88 65.65 6 0.46 2.92 84.22 7 1.14 2.91 60.88 8 1.73 3.14 44.91 9 1.19 2.29 48.02 10 1.19 2.58 53.98 11 2.32 2.81 17.17 12 2.33 2.78 16.13 13 0.83 1.94 57.31 The electrical power required by the batteries would come from a rechargeable source and could be used on several missions Also by 002ne tuning the gains to a speci\002c astronaut's choosing the system can be highly adaptable as far as work platform stiffness response time desired overshoot The CMGs provide a continuous control mechanism compared to the discrete on-off times of the thrusters and can eliminate errors associated with attitude or pointing requirements whereas a thrusters-only ACS can only work within the limits of a particular deadband set by the control system As a result the combined control mode provides a much smoother response to attitude disturbances than the thrusters Figure 14 shows box plots with the 002rst second 050median\051 and third quartiles of the data as well as the minimum and maximum On the left are the results from the combined ACS while on the right are the results from the RCS only ACS Figure 14 demonstrates that the entire 002rst through third quartiles of the combined ACS are below the 002rst quartile of the RCS thrusters only ACS Figure 15 plots the fuel consumption data for both control modes for each of the subjects The fuel consumption data reveals many interesting things such as the variation between subjects on the amount of fuel needed for the same control mode 050i.e subject 1 and subject 3 use a different amount of fuel for the RCS only control mode\051 Also the data shows that there is always a reduction in fuel used when switching Figure 14 226 Fuel Consumption Box Plot Figure 15 226 Plot of Fuel Consumption vs Subject 050Both Control Modes\051 between the RCS only control mode and the combined control mode 050the difference between the vertical lines\051 5 C ONCLUSION The use of real-time visualization software for simulation validation and testing is an extremely bene\002cial tool The graphics can provide insight into the behavior of the system During the initial setup actual thruster plume models were used to show which thrusters were being commanded by the ACS The observed behavior of the jets facilitated the veri\002cation of the DCM transformation between the Jetpack's body and asteroid's ACI coordinates Also the incorporation of graphics gave a more robust complete feeling to the simulation environment Pairing the graphics component with the VR Lab hardware 050helmet gloves 6-DoF electromagnetic tracking etc.\051 produced an immersive environment for algorithm testing since the subject could actually sit down and feel as if he/she were piloting the actual Jetpack system Current work already under progress and future work include modifying the simulation for various CMG architectures modeling CMG power consumption and selecting an optimal CMG size based on parametrically varying CMG parameters 050i.e 003ywheel speed 003ywheel inertia and gimbal rate\051 and a Monte Carlo sim framework Overall the combined ACS proved to be the preference of the 10 


human subjects Also from a design standpoint the combined control mode is also the preferred choice CMGs use electrical power which in turn reduces overall fuel consumption and extends mission life with the same given amount of propellant CMGs also are a continuous control actuator and therefore achieve a much 002ner pointing resolution than the thruster's discrete control actuator model By varying the control system gains one can create a much stiffer work platform and/or a faster response time depending upon the particular preference of the user Including four CMGs in a pyramid con\002guration provides a level of redundancy while also simplifying the steering law A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank NASA Johnson Space Center and in particular the VR Lab for their gracious support and help during this effort The members of the VR Lab helped with overall EDGE design and interface requirements They also helped with initial setup hardware integration and testing of the pre-existing hardware This work was supported by the Draper Laboratory Internal Research and Development 050IR&D\051 program We are very grateful for the support and acknowledgment from our Draper colleagues R EFERENCES   B Chapman A Crenshaw A Guertin and C Gwennap 0502013\051 A v ailable http://poe.olin.edu/poe2013/s  engr2210groundbots/Mechanical  Subsystem.html   N S Bedrossian J Paradiso E V Bergmann and D Rowell 223Redundant single gimbal control moment gyroscope singularity analysis,\224 Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics  vol 13 pp 1096\2261101 1990   M Jackson and R D McDonald 223Draper simulation analysis tool 050dsat\051 Graphical object simulation techniques and tools for simulink,\224 in AIAA Modeling and Simulation Technologies Conference and Exhibit  Providence Rhode Island Aug 2004   M.Carpenter B Cohanim K Duda J Rize C Dopart J Hoffman K Jackson and et al 223Next-generation maneuvering system with control-moment gyroscopes for extravehicular activities near low-gravity objects,\224 in AIAA International Conference on Environmental Systems  Vail Colorado Jul 2013   Metecs 0502010\051 Onli A v ailable http://www.metecs.com/products-edge.php   J Harrington 0502013\051 Available http://www.ascensiontech.com/realtime/rt\003ockofbirds.php   C Ericson Real-Time Collision Detection  New York NY Focal Press 2005   R Winkler and W Hays Statistics Probability Inference and Decision 0502nd edition\051  New York NY Holt Rinehart and Winston 1975 B IOGRAPHY  Jared Rize received his B.S in Mechanical Engineering 050Aerospace concentration\051 in 2012 from Lehigh University He is currently an M.S student in Aeronautical/Astronautical Engineering at MIT He is currently a Draper Laboratory Fellow at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Cambridge MA His current research activities include design and development of control laws for spacecraft or space vehicles with blended attitude control actuators Michele Carpenter is a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory She received a B.S in Astrophysics from UCLA in 2002 and a Ph.D in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Cornell University in 2009 Her Ph.D research focused on the dynamics and control of gyroscopically actuated space robotic systems At Draper she specializes in Guidance Navigation and Control algorithm development and analysis for strategic and space programs Prior to her graduate work she spent two years working in the Ballistic Missile Defense division at MIT Lincoln Laboratory Bobby Cohanim is the Mission Design Group Leader and a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory He joined Draper Laboratory in September 2006 He has led several space and autonomy R&D efforts while at Draper Before coming to Draper Bobby also worked at JPL He received his B.S from Iowa State University in Aerospace Engineering 0502002\051 his S.M in Aero/Astro from MIT 0502004\051 and ScD in Aero/Astro from MIT 0502013\051 Jeffrey Hoffman is Professor of the Practice of Aerospace Engineering in the Aero/Astro Department at MIT He received a B.A in Astronomy from Amherst College 0501966\051 a Ph.D in Astrophysics from Harvard 11

  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
