When the image is too big 
it will take a long time to compute affinity matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvect ors. In order to improve the convergent speed of spectral clustering, a twostage texture segmentation algorithm is proposed in this paper. First, an improved watershed algorithm is used to perform pre-segmentation and then multiway spectral clustering with eige nvalue-scaled eigenvectors performs the final segmentation. This can reduce the runtime greatly and it is valuable to application with high time request. To verify the proposed algorithm, it 
is applied to texture image segmentation and the segmentation results are satisfying  1. Introduction  In the recent years, Spectral methods have been developed rapidly and give competitive performance to the existing methods. Spectral methods are attractive because they donít restrict to normally distributed clusters and are easy to implement. They have strong theoretical background and are based on well-known cut criteria. They are effici ent approaches to calculate near-optimal bi-partitions and k-way partitions. While 
the data is too huge, it will take a long time to compute affinity matrix and its ei genvalues and eigenvectors Considering that and refere t e xt ure  image segmentation algorithm is proposed in this paper which combines watershed and multiway spectral clustering to produce better segmentation results. The two methods used here are simple and basic but their combination gives more satisfying results. From this, it can be drawn the conclusion that the new method is effective The new method is aimed at improving the 
convergent speed of spectral clustering and leveraging the best qualities of both segmentation approaches. The drawback of watershed for over segmentation becomes its strength, providing sm all prototype patches Simultaneously, the seeding problem encountered by many pure feature-based clustering algorithms is avoided. Rather than clustering single feature points we will cluster distributions, confident that the underlying primitive segmentations are reliable   2. Improved watershed and multiway spectral clustering algorithm 
 To improve the convergent speed of spectral clustering, a new texture image segmentation algorithm is proposed. The new algorithm first uses watershed to perform pre-segmentation and then uses spectral clustering to perform the final segmentation Watershed used in this paper not only is simple but also can keep the image boundaries. In addition, the spectral clustering used here is multiway spectral clustering with eigenvalue-scaled eigenvectors  
2.1. Watershed segmentation strategy  Watershed algorithm i s a ki nd of re gi on  extraction algorithms, which is simple and effective and has become a widely used image segmentation tool Watershed has the advantages of region growing algorithms \(the regions are spatially consistent, with boundaries forming a closed, connected set\till making use of edge information, as captured by the gradient surface. However, noise, which tends to be amplified by the derivative operator, manifests itself as over segmentation. In addition, vital information characterizing texture can be 
lost in the smoothing operation  So watershed algorithm is often not effective for texture images In order to improve the generalization of watershed techniques, a two-stage approach for texture image segmentation is proposed. Watershed algorithm is first used to provide over segmentation. And then, these primitive regions are used to construct a graph representation of the image. Last, the final 


1694 segmentation is performed by a new multiway spectral clustering with eigenvaluescaled eigenvectors. The new algorithm can make full use of texture features or information. Experiments show that it is more effective to texture image segmentation The applied watershed segmentation strategy includes three steps Step 1  Compute morphological gradient image Morphological gradient image reflects the gray change in the image. At the edge of acute gray change gradient value is also big while at the region of uniform gray change, gradient value is also small. The morphological gradient image is defined as dilating transformation subtracting eroding transformation       b f b f f grad     1 where  represents dilating transformation and   represents eroding transformation b is structuring element. It cannot be too big for it can filter out small region with acute gray change Step 2  Compute floating point activity image The ëfloating pointí refers to that the data type of the image is floating point. The floating point activity image has higher brightness value at image boundaries Therefore floating point activity image coarsely reflects image boundaries. The floating point activity image is defined as 0  255         f grad f grad f fimg  2 Step 3 Input floating point activity image into the watershed algorithm and get the initial segmentation result After the first stage, the over segmentation result is kept as the input of the next stage. In the second stage spectral clustering is used to perform the final segmentation. The reason that does not apply k-means directly to the data is that the natural clusters in 2 R do not correspond to convex regions and k-means run directly finds the unsatisfactory clustering. But once we map the points to k R they form tight clusters and better clustering result can be got  2.2. Multiway spectral clustering with eigenvalue-scaled eigenvectors  Spectral algorithms use information contained in the eigenvectors of a data affinity matrix to detect structure It has recently grown in popularity and has been used in a variety of situations, often successfully. Spectral methods are attractive because they have strong theoretical background and are easy to implement Also they do not intrinsically suffer from the problem of local optima Currently, spectral clustering algorithm can approximately be divided into three types. Recursive spectral algorithms try to split the data into two partitions based on a single eigenvector and then recursively generate more partitions, such as SM algorithm [3  Mu ltiway sp ec tr al alg o r ith m s  u s e m o r e  information in multiple eigenvectors to do a direct multiway partition of data, such as NJW [4 alg o r ith m   Non-spectral algorithms are usually simple grouping algorithm that clusters the data quickly. In [5  it is shown that the multiway spectral clustering algorithms are slightly better performing especially when there is structure to be easily found in the data. Therefore, a multiway spectral clustering is applied whose eigenvectors are also scaled by its eigenvalues Suppose that      2 1 n x x x X  is the set of block features and X is divided into K subsets Gauss kernel is used in this paper and  is kernel parameter. The algorithm is described in detail as follows Step 1  Compute affinity matrix n n R S   Affinity matrix considers both the similarity information and position information   2  exp 2 2  j i ij x x S    if j i  otherwise 0  ii S  Step 2  Compute the diagonal matrix D Its diagonal element    i i is the sum of each row in S  i.e  j ij S i i D    Construct 2  1 2  1    SD D L which not only normalizes S but make S be a symmetric matrix Step 3 Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of L Suppose that the first biggest K eigenvalues are K i i   1    and the corresponding eigenvectors are K i e i   1     Step 4  Use the first biggest K eigenvalues to scale the corresponding eigenvectors K i e i   1   i.e K K e e e       2 2 1 1 and get the matrix K n R V    Step 5 Normalize each row of V to have unit length It has been proven that the normalized spectral clustering has better performance than the unnormalized on  Step 6 Make each row of V as a point in K R and then use k-means \(KM\o cluster them into K  clusters Step 7 When the i th row of V is assigned to the j th cluster, the original data point i x is then assigned to the j th cluster It has been shown when the data points are clustered into K clusters, the first biggest K eigenvectors are pairwise constant h eref ore, th e f i rs t bi gg es t K  eigenvectors are selected in step 3. The advantages of using multiple eigenvectors are: \(1\proximate the optimal k-way normalized cut, \(2\sform data to a 


1695 new embedded space, consisting of k orthogonal basis vectors, \(3\revent instability due to information loss Here, from the viewpoint of polarization theorem   w e ex plain t h e adv a n t a g es of eig e nv alu e s caled  eigenvectors. When the dimension of eigenvectors is reduced, the angles decrease between points with high similarity and increase between points with low similarity, highlighting the clustering structure. Thus any heuristic post-processing algorithm is more likely to succeed In order to overcome KM initialization-dependent we run KM many times and keep the segmentation with minimal error as the final segmentation result  3. Feature extraction and experiments  3.1. Feature extraction  Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix \(GLCM\ is an effective tool for texture feature extraction. It is controlled by partial parameters and can extract texture feature from many directions. While wavelet is a global transform. It has the better characteristic of time-frequent analysis and can analyze and represent the texture structure from different scales. The two features can compensate for each other. Obviously combining different texture features is helpful to improve the segmentation accuracy Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix \(GLCM\ a second-order texture measure describes the frequency of one gray tone  In practical application, feature vectors used for texture recognition are some statistical vectors computed from GLCM. Haralick [8 pro pos ed  14 statistical vectors computed from GLCM. For simplicity, angle second-order moment, correlation entropy and inverse difference moment are computed from GLCM as image features in this paper To extract the multi-scale information of images and make full use of the characteristic of wavelet time-frequent local feature, multi-scale and directional feature, wavelet texture feature are extracted. There are many measure standards for texture such as 3 l norm mean energy and entropy and so on. For simplicity 1 l  norm and mean variance are used to texture measure Their formulae are respectively defined as    M i N j j i w MN e 11 1    1 3     M i N j w j i w MN e 11 2    1 4  where N M  is the size of wavelet decomposition sub-band image i and j respectively represent row and column of the image w is wavelet decomposition coefficients and w is the mean value of wavelet decomposition coefficients. This shows that for wavelet decomposition of level L the dimension of feature vector is  1 3     L D In this paper Daubechies3 are used to decompose images into 3 layers For the over segmentation result produced by watershed is irregular, it is impossible to directly extract the texture feature from irregular block using GLCM and wavelet. Therefore, first we extract the texture feature from each pixe l in the irregular block and then use the mean valu e of the pixels in the irregular region as its feature. It should be pointed out that to make all features have the same importance every feature has been normalized by its maximum   3.2. Experiments and discussions  In this section, three texture images of size 256 256  are selected to verify the proposed algorithm and shown in Fig.1\(a\, Fig.2\(a\ig.3\(a respectively. In spectral clustering, the kernel parameter is set by experience and 3  0   GLCM and wavelet are used to feature extraction. The segmentation results are given in Fig.1, Fig.2 and Fig.3 And the corresponding block number and error rate are also given in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 From this experiment, it can be concluded that the proposed method is superior to KM. During the experiment, we observe that the KM is initializationdependent and its two different results appear at the same probability It should be pointed out that, in the two clustering algorithms, the clustering number k is given in advance In this experiment, the two methods have almost the same results though there are some differences between them. The result of the proposed algorithm has better linear boundary while worse curve boundary than that of KM. Because the kernel parameter in spectral clustering is set by experience, it affects the segmentation result to a certain extent    a\riginal image                   \(b\shed

But the new algorithm not only can segment it into five parts completely but the four-part segmentation result is also better than KM. Therefore the new algorithm is effective For the paper is concentrated on the improved algorithm and its application to image segmentation all images are segmented without post-processing Therefore, post-processing is one of our further work  4. Conclusions  In order to improve the convergent speed of spectral clustering, a two-stage texture segmetation algorithm is proposed in this paper. Watershed is used to perform pre-segmentation and spectral clustering to perform the final segmentation. This can reduce the runtime and it is valuable to application with high time request Experiments on texture images show that the new 


1697 algorithm is effective and the segmentation results are satisfying. But the kernel parameter in spectral clustering is determined by experience, how to determine kernel parameter effectively demands our further research  5.

the necessary condition of the decision point of the relation which is responsible for executing the subtree 5 Integrating the Overall Behavior Speciìcation Up to this point we have described how to build a dialogue state machine which is capable to represent the set of possible ows of communicative act utterances set of possible dialogues These dialogue state machines contain sequences of states and decision points allowing the system and the user to inîuence the advancement of the dialogue but they also include some freedom of choosing dialogue paths through order-independent sequences modeled in the form of concurrent sub-state machines Nevertheless these dialogue state machines do not make any statements about the behavior of user interfaces per se The actual behavior depends on the modality we use for the user interface In case of speech input and output these dialogue statemachines can serve immediately the implementation of a dialogue system In case of a graphical user interface we need additional mechanisms and algorithms to derive presentation units and their behavior i.e transitions between the presentation units A presentation unit represents a set with a maximum number of communicative acts that can go in parallel If there is enough real estate on a given screen a presentation unit can be equivalent to an application window The following subsections describe how to derive presentation units from the composite statechart by aggregating information and how to derive a GUI statemachine from the composite statechart The GUI statemachine models the transitions between the presentation units and thus the behavior of the graphical user interface 5.1 Presentation unit generation By analyzing the composite statechart we are able to derive the set of possible presentation units containing the maximum possible information that can go in parallel The generation of the presentation units is achieved by traversing the statechart for each possible set of truth values of the decision point conditions until reaching statecharts corresponding to adjacency pairs leaves of our discourse trees During this traversal all the dialogue states are collected that can be represented together in principle on a screen of a graphical user interface The algorithm for generating the structure of each presentation unit e.g widget hierarchy is based on rendering heuristics and is described in For instance in our online shop example we can infer the product category selection presentation unit shown as an automatically generated window in Figure 7 starting from the situation where a user is logged in the user did not request Figure 7 Generated screen allowing product category selection and checkout to checkout  checkout  false  and a product category is not set yet When traversing the composite statechart in Figure 6 starting with this set of truth values at the Initial state we arrive at the alternative composite state in a rst step Since this state contains two parallel submachines we go to the  Checkout offer and accept adjacency pair at the top and to the Elaboration composite state below Continuing in the Elaboration composite state the Background state at the bottom is bypassed due to the fact that no product category is set In the upper part of the Elaboration composite state we go to the Select Product Category adjacency pair statechart Since we stop at each adjacency pair statechart we get a presentation unit consisting of the closed question Select Product Category and the offer Checkout as shown in Figure 7 Once we set a product category we can also explore the Background state within the Elaboration composite state and get a presentation unit that contains in addition Informing on volume discount and the closed question Add Product  This presentation unit is shown in Figure 8 When setting checkout to true and the shopping cart is not empty we get a presentation unit operationalizing only the Checkout Data adjacency pair shown in Figure 9 For generating transitions between the presentation units in the next section we have to save the discovered mapping between the set of truth values of the conditions and the corresponding presentation unit e.g in a lookup table 5.2 Deìning transitions between presentation units To complete the behavior speciìcation of user interfaces we have to specify the transitions between presentation units To specify them one has to gure out which decision point condition in the dialogue state machine depends on which event Events can be either the utterance of communicative acts or external events e.g timer events In the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


Figure 8 Generated screen allowing product selection and checkout online shop example of Figure 2 the truth values of all conditions depend only on the outcome of uttering communicative acts and they do not change without communication by external means The transitions from one presentation unit to the other can be derived by applying the algorithm sketched below and will result in a user interface state machine like the one shown in Figure 10 for our online shop example 1 For specifying an initial state use default truth values for the conditions of each decision point ideally derived from a standard situation in the domain of discourse E.g in our online shop example this could be to unset checkout  username  password and productCategory  2 Analyze dependencies between the conditions of the decision points and the communicative acts to gure out which condition is inîuenced by which communicative acts For example the two conditions of the IfUntil relation depend on the checkout variable which can be only changed by the communicative acts of the Checkout offer  accept adjacency pair 3 Select one of the generated presentation units and get all conditions whose truth values can be changed by the outcome of uttering any communicative act allowed in the selected presentation unit E.g within the Login presentation unit there is only an answer communicative act allowed which may change the locked or check\(username password conditions 4 Change the truth value of each selected condition and look up the presentation units that correspond to the new sets of condition values in the association table created during the presentation set generation process described in the previous section Afterwards add transitions to the presentation unit state machine between its original state and its looked-up states 5 Repeat steps 3 und 4 until all presentation units are processed resulting in a complete nite-state machine Figure 9 Generated screen for entering checkout data 5.3 Behavior of the resulting UI The presentation unit state machine in Figure 10 speciìes the resulting behavior of a user interface In our online shop example each presentation unit is directly mapped to a window for a graphical user interface shown in Figures 7 8 and 9 corresponding to the lower three states in Figure 10 in that order Starting with the login presentation unit the answering of the Login closed question modiìes the variables username and password  This in turn has effects on the conditions check\(username password and locked  If the check of username and password evaluates to true the dialogue continues in the presentation unit for selecting the product category The conditions evaluated for this presentation unit transition result directly from the IfUntil procedural construct in the discourse model Looking at the transition between the PU Product Category corresponding to Figure 7 and the PU Product corresponding to Figure 8 the transition condition bound\(productcategory does not result from procedural constructs but from variable binding This is analyzed during the process of composing the overall dialogue statechart Thus selecting a product results in displaying additional information on volume discount and a closed question about products to add to the shopping cart Once a transition leads to the nal state the dialogue and thus the application ends This generated presentation unit state machine describes what can go in parallel and be presented together at maximum Thus it is the other end of a spectrum of dialogues and user interfaces ranging from completely serialized to this maximum of parallel dialogues This allows for different modalities to be used for input and output independently developed from the discourses There are modalities which allow parallel multi-dimensional dialogues like graphical user interfaces In contrast modalities like speech or console text are serial interfaces which lead to serialized interProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8

execution Most of these approaches utilize some kind of state machinery for this Book and Gruhn present an approach to describe the dialogue by dialogue graphs that are enhanced state machines They present the formal semantics of the Dialogue Flow Notation DFN that provides constructs for the design of modular navigation models These dialogue graphs are on the same level as our composite statecharts describing all possible dialogue paths The dialogue graphs have to be speciìed by the UI designer whereas our composite statecharts are automatically generated from the high-level discourse model ConcurTaskTrees are a w ay of hierarchical task modeling where different temporal relations among tasks can be speciìed e.g enabling disabling concurrency order independence and suspend-resume Out of such task models the user interface can be created through several steps of model transformations CTT also allows the derivation of presentation units consisting of a set of tasks and their transitions but their transition graph is more abstract than our presentation unit state machine skipping detailed trigger events for the transitions Elkoutbi et al present an approach that generates a user interface prototype from scenarios Scenarios are enriched with UI information and are automatically transformed into UML statecharts which are then used for UI prototype generation In contrast to this approach we model classes of dialogues supporting a set of scenarios We are not aware of any approach that would generate the behavior of user interfaces automatically from a largely declarative high-level discourse model In addition to taking a communication-centric approach and modeling humanmachine communication in the form of discourses we generate user interfaces automatically including their behavior 8 Conclusion In this paper we address the issue of automatic generation of the behavior of a user interface from a high-level discourse model While the generation seems to be possible from a purely declarative model the complete behavioral operationalization is facilitated by introducing behavioral constructs into the otherwise declarative model We deìned procedural semantics for both the procedural and the declarative constructs of the discourse model using statecharts Based on these building blocks for operationalization we showed how composite statecharts for whole discourse trees can be generated These directly deìne all possible behaviors of a fully serialized user interface e.g using speech input and output In contrast for a graphical user interface with potentially inìnite screen size we showed a derivation of a nite-state machine from a composite statechart for deìning its behavior The behavior of multimodal interfaces can be deìned in the spectrum between these extremes In this way we have deìned how the behavior of user interfaces can be automatically generated from a largely declarative high-level discourse model Taking this together with generating structural UI models enables the automatic generation of user interfaces from such discourse models 9 Acknowledgements This research has been carried out in the CommRob project  http://www.commrob.eu  and is partially funded by the EU contract number IST-045441 under the 6th framework programme References  C Bogdan J F alb H Kaindl S Ka v aldjian R Popp H Horacek E Arnautovic and A Szep Generating an abstract user interface from a discourse model inspired by human communication In Proceedings of the 41th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences HICSS-41  Piscataway NJ USA 2008 IEEE Computer Society Press  M Book and V  Gruhn Modeling Web-based dialog o ws for automatic dialog control In Proceedings of the 19th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering ASEê04  pages 100Ö109 Washington DC USA 2004 IEEE Computer Society  M Elk outbi I Khriss and R K K eller  Automated prototyping of user interfaces based on UML scenarios Automated Software Engg  13\(1 2006  S Ka v aldjian C Bogdan J F alb and H Kaindl T ransforming discourse models to structural user interface models In Models in Software Engineering LNCS  volume 5002/2008 pages 77Ö88 Springer Berlin  Heidelberg 2008  S K ost Dynamically Generated Multi-Modal Application Interfaces  PhD thesis TU Dresden 2006  P  Luf f N Gilbert and D Frohlich Computers and Conversation  Academic Press 1990  W  C Mann and S Thompson Rhetorical Structure Theory Toward a functional theory of text organization In Text  pages 243Ö281 1988  G Mori F  P aterno and C Santoro Design and de v elopment of multidevice user interfaces through multiple logical descriptions IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering  30\(8 8 2004  J R Searle Speech Acts An Essay in the Philosophy of Language  Cambridge University Press Cambridge England 1969 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 


 11 This model specifies that covariates act multiplicatively on time t r than on the hazar d function.  That is, we assume a baseline hazard function to exist and that the effects of the covariates are to alter the rate at which an individual proceeds along the time axis.  In other words, the covariates z accelerates or decelerates the time to failure Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003  It should be pointed out that the distribution-based regression models for exponential and Weibull distributions in the previous section are th e special cases of both PHM and AFT.  This correspondence is not necessarily true for models based on other distribu tions. Indeed, two-parameter Weibull distribution has the uniq ue property that it is closed under both multiplication of fa ilure time and multiplication of the hazard function by an arbitrary nonzero constant Lawless 2003, Kalbfleisch & Prentice 2002, Klein Moeschberger 2003  2.6. Counting Process and Survival Analysis   In the previous sections, we introduced censoring and survival analysis models th at can handle the censored information; however, we did not discuss how the censored information is processed.  Accommodating and maximally utilizing the partial information from the censored observations is the most challenging and also the most rewarding task in survival anal ysis.  This also establishes survival analysis as a unique fiel d in mathematical statistics Early statistical inferences for censored data in survival analysis were dependent on asymptotic likelihood theory Severini 2000\ Cox \(1972, 1975\ proposed partial likelihood as an extension to classical maximum likelihood estimation in the context of hi s proportional hazards model as a major contribution. Asymptotic likelihood has been and still is the dominant theory for developing survival analysis inference and hypothesis testing methods \(Klein and Moeschberger 2003, Severini 2000\. There are many monographs and textbooks of survival analysis containing sufficient details for applying survival analysis \(Cox and Oakes 1984, Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980, 2002, Lawless 1982, 2003, Klein and Moeschberger, 2003\. A problem with traditional asymptotic lik elihood theory is that the resulting procedures can become very complicated when handling more complex censoring mechanisms \(Klein Moeschberger 2003\. A more elegant but requiring rigorous measure-theoretic probability theo ry is the approach with counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theorems.  Indeed, this approach was used by Aalen 1975\ to set the rigorous mathematical foundation for survival analysis, and later further developed and summarized by Fleming and Harrington \(1991\, Andersen et al. \(1993\several research papers.  In reliability theory Aven and Jensen \(1999\ dem onstrated such an approach by developing a general failure model, which we briefly introduced in Section 1.2. However, the counting process and Martingale approach require measure theoretic treatments of probability and st ochastic processes, which is often not used in engineering or applied statistics.  A detailed introduction of the topic is obviously beyond the scope of this paper, and we only present a brief sketch of the most important concepts involved.  Readers are referred to the excellent monographs by Andersen et al. \(1993 Fleming and Harrington \(1991\ Aven and Jensen \(1999\ for comprehensive details, and Kal bfleisch and Prentice \(2002 Klein and Moeschberger \(2003\, Lawless \(2003\ for more applicationñoriented treatments The following discussion on this topic is drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  A counting stochastic process N  t  t 0 possesses the properties that N  0 ro and N  t   with probability one. The sample paths of N  t ht continuous and piecewise constant with jumps of size 1  step function In a right-censored sample, \(we assume only right censoring in this section N i  t  I  T i t  i   which keep the value 0 until individual i fails and then jump to 1  are counting processes. The accumulation of N i  t ocess     1 t N t N n i i is again a counting process, which counts the number of failures in the sample at or before time t   The counting process keeps track of the information on the occurrences of events,   for instance, the history information such as which individual was censored prior to time t and which individual died at or prior to time t as well as the covariates information This accumulated history information of the counting process at time t is termed filtration at time t denoted by F t For a given problem F t  rests on the observer of the counting process.  Thus, two observers with different recordings at different times will get different filtrations.  This is what Aven and Jensen 1999\ referred to as different information levels or the amount of actual available information about the state of a system may vary  If the failure times X i and censoring times C i  are independent,  then the probability of an event occurs at time t given the history just prior to t  F t\n be expressed as  t T if dt t h t C t X dt t C dt t X t P F dt t T t P i i i i i i r t i i r          1     t T if F dt t T t P i t i i r 0   1    51  Let dN  t be the change in the process N  t over a short time interval    t t t Ignoring the neglig ible chance of ties 1   t dN if a failure occurred and 0   t dN otherwise  Let Y  t denote the number of individuals with an observation time T i t Then the conditional expectation of dN  t   dt t h t Y F dt t C dt t X t with ns observatio of number E F t dN E t i i i t              52 


 12 The process  t  Y  t  h  t  is called the intensity process  of the counting process.  It is a stochastic process that is determined by the information contained in the history process F t via Y  t  Y  t  records the number of individuals experiencing the risk at a given time t   As it will become clear that   t is equivalent to the failure rate or hazard function in tr aditional reliability theory, but here it is treated as a stochastic process, the most general form one can assume for it. It is this generalization that encapsulates the power that counting stochastic process approach can offer to survival analysis  Let the cumulative intensity process H  t be defined as   t t ds s t H 0 0      53  It has the property that  E  N  t  F t  E  H  t  F t  H  t   54  This implies that filtration F t, is known, the value of Y  t  fixed and H  t es deterministic H  t is equivalent to the cumulative hazards in tr aditional reliability theory  A stochastic process with the property that its expectation at time t given history at time s < t is equal to its value at s is called a martingale That is M  t martingale if           t s s M F t M E s  55  It can be verified that the stochastic process         t H t N t M 56  is a martingale, and it is called the counting process martingale The increments of the counting process martingale have an expected value of zero, given its filtration F t That is  0      t F t dM E 57 The first part of the counting process martingale [Equation 56  N  t non-decreasing step function.  The second part H  t smooth process which is predictable in that its value at time t is fixed just prior to time t It is known as the compensator  of the counting process and is a random function. Therefore, the martingale can be considered as mean-zero noise and that is obtainable when one subtracts the smoothly varying compensator from the counting process  Another key component in the counting process and martingale theory for survival analysis is the notion of the predictable variation process of M  t oted by    t M It is defined as the compensator of process   2 t M  The term predictable variation process comes from the property that, for a martingale M  t it can be verified that the conditional variance of the increments of M  t  dM  t  h e inc r em ents of   t M That is          t M d F t dM Var t  58  To obtain      t F t dM Var  one needs the random variable N  t  variable with probability   t of having a jump of size 1 at time t The variance of N  t   t  1 t   since it follows b i nom ial distribution    Ignoring the ties in the censored data 2  t  is close to zero and Var  dM  t  F t    t  Y  t  h  t   This implies that the counting process N  t on the filtration F t behaves like a Poisson process with rate  t    Why do we need to convert the previous very intuitive concepts in survival analysis in to more abstract martingales The key is that many of the sta tistics in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of the basic martingales described above The stochastic integral equations are mathematically well structured and some standard mathematical techniques for studying them can be adopted  Here, let   t K be a predictable  process An example of a predictable process is the process   t Y Over the interval 0 to t the stochastic integral of su ch a process, with respect to a martingale, is denoted by     0 u dM u K t It turns out that such stochastic integrals them selves are martingales as a function of t and their predictable variation process can be found from the predictable variation process of the original martingale by           0 2 0 u M d u K u dM u K t t 59 The above discussion was drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003 also provide examples of how the above process is applied. In the following, we briefly introduce one of their exampl es ó the derivation of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator  First, the model is formulated as           t dM dt t h t Y t dN  60  If   t Y is non-zero, then               t Y t dM t d t h t Y t dN 61  Let   t I be the indicator of whether   t Y  is positive and define 0/0 = 0, then integrating both sides of above \(61 One get 


 13                     0 0 0 u dM u Y u I u d u h u I u dN u Y u I t t t 62  The left side integral is the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H t           0  u dN u Y u I t H t 63  The second integral on the right side           0 u dM u Y u I t W t 64  is the stochastic integral of the predictable process      u Y u I with respect to a martingale, and hence is also a martingale  The first integral on the right side is a random quantity    t H   t du u h u I t H 0        65  For right-censored data it is equal to   t H  in the data range, if the stochastic uncertainty in the   t W is negligible Therefore, the statistic    t H is a nonparametric estimator of the random quantity    t H   We would like to mention one more advantage of the new approach, that is, the martingale central limit theorem.  The central limit theorem of martingales ensures certain convergence property and allows the derivations of confidence intervals for many st atistics.  In summary, most of the statistics developed with asymptotic likelihood theory in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of some martingale.  The large sample properties of the statistics can be found by using the predictable variation process and martingale central limit theorem \(Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  2.7. Bayesian Survival Analysis  Like many other fields of statistics, survival analysis has also witnessed the rapid expansion of the Bayesian paradigm.  The introduction of the full-scale Bayesian paradigm is relative recent and occurred in the last decade however, the "invasion" has been thorough.  Until the recent publication of a monograph by Ibrahim, Chen and Sinhaet 2005\val anal ysis has been either missing or occupy at most one chapter in most survival analysis monographs and textbooks.  Ibrahim's et al. \(2005\ changed the landscape, with their comprehensive discussion of nearly every counterp arts of frequentist survival analysis from univariate to multivariate, from nonparametric, semiparametric to parametric models, from proportional to nonproportional hazards models, as well as the joint model of longitudinal and survival data.  It should be pointed out that Bayesian survival analysis has been studied for quite a while and can be traced back at least to the 1970s  A natural but fair question is what advantages the Bayesian approach can offer over the established frequentist survival analysis. Ibrahim et al 2005\entified two key advantages. First, survival models are generally very difficult to fit, due to the complex likelihood functions to accommodate censoring.  A Bayesi an approach may help by using the MCMC techniques and there is available software e.g., BUGS.  Second, the Bayesian paradigm can incorporate prior information in a natural way by using historical information, e.g., from clinical trials. The following discussion in this subsection draws from Ibrahim's et al. \(2005  The Bayesian paradigm is based on specifying a probability model for the observed data, given a vector of unknown parameters This leads to likelihood function L   D   Unlike in traditional statistics is treated as random and has a prior distribution denoted by   Inference concerning is then based on the posterior distribution which can be computed by Bayes theorem d D L D L D              66 where is the parameter space  The term    D is proportional to the likelihood    D L  which is the information from observed data, multiplied by the prior, which is quantified by   i.e          D L D 67 The denominator integral m  D s the normalizing constant of    D and often does not have an analytic closed form Therefore    D often has to be computed numerically The Gibbs sampler or other MCMC algorithms can be used to sample    D without knowing the normalizing constant m  D xist large amount of literature for solving the computational problems of m  D nd    D   Given that the general Bayesian algorithms for computing the posterior distributions should equally apply to Bayesian survival analysis, the specification or elicitation of informative prior needs much of the atte ntion.  In survival analysis with covariates such as Cox's proportional hazards model, the most popular choice of informative prior is the normal prior, and the most popular choice for noninformative is the uniform Non-informative prior is easy to use but they cannot be used in all applications, such as model selection or model comparison. Moreover, noninformative prior does not harness the real prior information. Therefore, res earch for informative prior specification is crucial for Bayesian survival analysis  


 14 Reliability estimation is influenced by the level of information available such as information on components or sub-systems. Bayesians approach is likely to provide such flexibility to accommodate various levels of information Graves and Hamada \(2005\roduced the YADAS a statistical modeling environment that implements the Bayesian hierarchical modeli ng via MCMC computation They showed the applications of YADES in reliability modeling and its flexibility in processing hierarchical information. Although this environment seems not designed with Bayesian surviv al analysis, similar package may be the direction if Bayesian survival analysis is applied to reliability modeling  2.8. Spatial Survival Analysis  To the best of our knowledge spatial survival analysis is an uncharted area, and there has been no spatial survival analysis reported with rigor ous mathematical treatment There are some applications of survival analysis to spatial data; however, they do not address the spatial process which in our opinion should be the essential aspect of any spatial survival analysis. To develop formal spatial survival analysis, one has to define the spatial process first  Recall, for survival analysis in the time domain, there is survival function   R t t T t S  Pr   68  where T is the random variable and S  t e cumulative probability that the lifetime will exceed time t In spatial domain, what is the counterpart of t One may wonder why do not we simply define the survival function in the spatial domain as   S  s  Pr S s  s R d  R > 0  69  where s is some metric for d-dimensional space R d and the space is restricted to the positive region S is the space to event measurement, e.g., the distance from some origin where we detect some point object.  The problem is that the metric itself is an attribute of space, rather than space itself Therefore, it appears to us that the basic entity for studying the space domain has to be broader than in the time domain This is probably why spatial process seems to be a more appropriate entity for studying  The following is a summary of descriptions of spatial processes and patterns, which intends to show the complexity of the issues involved.  It is not an attempt to define the similar survival function in spatial domain because we certainly unders tand the huge complexity involved. There are several monographs discussing the spatial process and patterns \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\.  The following discussion heavily draws from Cressie \(1993\ and Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  It appears that the most widely adopted definition for spatial process is proposed in Cressie \(1993\, which defines a spatial process Z  s in d-dimensions as    Z  s  s D R d  70  Here Z  s denotes the attributes we observe, which are space dependent. When d = 2 the space R 2 is a plane  The problem is how to define randomness in this process According to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005 Z  s an be thought of as located \(indexed\by spatial coordinates s  s 1  s 2  s n  the counterpart of time series Y  t  t   t 1  t 2  t n   indexed by time.  The spatial process is often called random field   To be more explicit, we denote Z  s  Z  s   to emphasize that Z is the outcome of a random experiment  A particular realization of produces a surface    s Z  Because the surface from whic h the samples are drawn is the result of the random experiment Z  s called a random function  One might ask what is a random experiment like in a spatial domain? Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\ offered an imaginary example briefly described below.  Imagine pouring sand from a bucket on to a desktop surface, and one is interested in measuring the depth of the poured sand at various locations, denoted as Z  s The sand distributes on the surface according to the laws of physics.  With enough resources and patience, one can develop a deterministic model to predict exactly how the sand grains are distributed on the desktop surface.  This is the same argument used to determine the head-tail coin flipping experiment, which is well accepted in statistical scie nce. The probabilistic coinflip model is more parsimonious than the deterministic model that rests on the exact \(perfect\but hardly feasible representation of a coin's physics. Similarly deterministically modeling the placement of sand grains is equally daunting.  However, th e issue here is not placement of sand as a random event, as Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\phasized.  The issue is that the sand was poured only once regardless how many locations one measures the depth of the sand.  With that setting, the challenge is how do we define and compute the expectation of the random function Z  s Would E  Z  s   s  make sense  Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\further raised the questions: \(1\to what distribution is the expectation being computed? \(2\ if the random experiment of sand pouring can only be counted once, ho w can the expectation be the long-term average  According to the definition of expectation in traditional statistics, one should repeat the process of sand pouring many times and consider the probability distributions of all surfaces generated from the repetitions to compute the expectation of Z  s is complication is much more serious 


 15 than what we may often reali ze. Especially, in practice many spatial data is obtained from one time space sample only. There is not any independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  How is the enormous complexity in spatial statistics currently dealt with? The most commonly used simplification, which has also been vigorously criticized, is the stationarity assumption.  Opponents claim that stationarity often leads to erroneous inferences and conclusions.  Proponents counte r-argue that little progress can be made in the study of non-stationary process, without a good understanding of the stationary issues Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  The strict stationarity is a random field whose spatial distribution is invariant under translation of the coordination.  In other word s, the process repeats itself throughout its domain \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005 There is also a second-order or weak\ of a random field  For random fields in the spatial domain, the model of Equation \(70  Z  s  s D R d  is still too general to allow statistical inference.  It can be decomposed into several sub-processes \(Cressie 1993             s s s W s s Z  D s  71  where  s  E  Z  is a deterministic mean structure called large-scale variation W  s is the zero-mean intrinsically stationary process, \(with second order derivative\nd it is called smooth small-scale variation   s is the zero-mean stationary process independent of W  s and is called microscale variation  s  is zero-mean white noise also called measurement error. This decomposition is not unique and is largely operational in nature \(Cressie 1993\he main task of a spatial algorithm is to determine the allocations of the large, small, and microscale components However, the form of the above equation is fixed Cressie 1993\, implying that it is not appropriate to sub-divide one or more of the items. Therefore, the key issue here is to obtain the deterministic  s  but in practice, especially with limited data, it is usually very difficult to get a unique  s   Alternative to the spatial domain decomposition approach the frequency domain methods or spectral analysis used in time series analysis can also be used in spatial statistics Again, one may refer to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  So, what are the imp lications of the general discussion on spatial process above to spatial survival analysis?  One point is clear, Equation \(69 S  s  Pr S s   s R d is simply too naive to be meaningful.  There seem, at least, four fundamental challenges when trying to develop survival analysis in space domain. \(1\ process is often multidimensional, while time pr ocess can always be treated as uni-dimensional in the sense that it can be represented as  Z  t  t R 1  The multidimensionality certainly introduces additional complications, but that is still not the only complication, perhaps not even the most significant 2\One of the fundamental complications is the frequent lack of independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process, as pointed out by Cressie \(1993\\(3\e superposition of \(1 and \(2\brings up even more complexity, since coordinates  s of each replication are a set of stochastic spatial process rather than a set of random variables. \(4\n if the modeling of the spatial process is separable from the time process, it is doubtful how useful the resulting model will be.  In time process modeling, if a population lives in a homogenous environment, the space can be condensed as a single point.  However, the freezing of time seems to leave out too much information, at least for survival analysis Since the traditional survival analysis is essentially a time process, therefore, it should be expanded to incorporate spatial coordinates into original survival function.  For example, when integrating space and time, one gets a spacetime process, such as          R t R D s t s Z d   where s is the spatial index \(coordinate t is time.  We may define the spatial-temporal survival function as   S  s  t  Pr T t  s D  72  where D is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidean space That is, the spatial-temporal survival function represents the cumulative probability that an individual will survive up to time T within hyperspace D which is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidian space.  One may define different scales for D or even divide D into a number of unit hyperspaces of measurement 1 unit  2.9. Survival Analysis and Artificial Neural Network   In the discussion on artificial neuron networks \(ANN Robert & Casella \(2004\noted, "Baring the biological vocabulary and the idealistic connection with actual neurons, the theory of neuron networks covers: \(1\odeling nonlinear relations between explanatory and dependent explained\ariables; \(2\mation of the parameters of these models based on a \(training\ sample."  Although Robert & Casella \(2004\ did not mentioned survival analysis, their notion indeed strike us in that the two points are also the essence of Cox s \(1972\roportional Hazards model  We argue that the dissimilarity might be superficial.  One of the most obvious differences is that ANN usually avoids probabilistic modeling, however, the ANN models can be analyzed and estimated from a statistical point of view, as demonstrated by Neal \(1999\, Ripley \(1994\, \(1996 Robert & Casella \(2004\What is more interesting is that the most hailed feature of ANN, i.e., the identifiability of model structure, if one review carefully, is very similar to the work done in survival anal ysis for the structure of the 


 16 Cox proportional hazards model. The multilayer ANN model, also known as back-propagation ANN model, is again very similar to the stratified proportional hazards model  There are at least two advantages of survival analysis over the ANN.  \(1\val analysis has a rigorous mathematical foundation. Counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theory form the survival analysis models as stochastic integral s, which provide insight for analytic solutions. \(2\ ANN, simulation is usually necessary \(Robert & Casella \(2004\which is not the case in survival analysis  Our conjecture may explain a very interesting phenomenon Several studies have tried to integrate ANN with survival analysis.  As reviewed in the next section, few of the integrated survival analysis and ANN made significant difference in terms of model fittings, compared with the native survival analysis alone The indifference shows that both approaches do not complement each other.  If they are essentially different, the inte grated approach should produce some results that are signifi cantly different from the pure survival analysis alone, either positively or negatively Again, we emphasize that our discussion is still a pure conjecture at this stage   3   B RIEF C ASE R EVIEW OF S URVIVAL A NALYSIS A PPLICATIONS     3.1. Applications Found in IEEE Digital Library  In this section, we briefly review the papers found in the IEEE digital library w ith the keyword of survival analysis  search. The online search was conducted in the July of 2007, and we found about 40 papers in total. There were a few biomedical studies among the 40 survival-analysis papers published in IEEE publications. These are largely standard biomedical applications and we do not discuss these papers, for obvious reasons  Mazzuchi et al. \(1989\m ed to be the first to actively  advocate the use of Cox's \(1 972\ proportional hazards model \(PHM\in engineering re liability.  They quoted Cox's 1972\ original words industrial reliability studies and medical studies to show Cox's original motivation Mazzuchi et al \(1989 while this model had a significant impact on the biom edical field, it has received little attention in the reliability literature Nearly two decades after the introducti on paper of Mazzuchi et al 1989\ears that little significant changes have occurred in computer science and IEEE related engineering fields with regard to the proportional hazards models and survival analysis as a whole  Stillman et al. \(1995\used survival analysis to analyze the data for component maintenance and replacement programs Reineke et al. \(1998 ducted a similar study for determining the optimal maintenance by simulating a series system of four components Berzuini and Larizza \(1996 integrated time-series modeling with survival analysis for medical monitoring.  Kauffman and Wang \(2002\analyzed the Internet firm su rvival data from IPO \(initial public offer to business shutdown events, with survival analysis models  Among the 40 survival analysis papers, which we obtained from online search of the IEEE digital library, significant percentage is the integration of survival analysis with artificial neural networks \(ANN In many of these studies the objective was to utilize ANN to modeling fitting or parameter estimation for survival analysis.  The following is an incomplete list of the major ANN survival analysis integration papers found in IEEE digital library, Arsene et 2006 Eleuteri et al. \(2003\oa and Wong \(2001\,  Mani et al 1999\ The parameter estimation in survival analysis is particular complex due to the requirements for processing censored observations. Therefore, approach such as ANN and Bayesian statistics may be helpful to deal with the complexity. Indeed, Bayesian survival analysis has been expanded significantly in recent years \(Ibrahim, et al. 2005  We expect that evolutionary computing will be applied to survival analysis, in similar way to ANN and Bayesian approaches  With regard to the application of ANN to survival analysis we suggest three cautions: \(1\he integrated approach should preserve the capability to process censoring otherwise, survival analysis loses its most significant advantage. \(2\ Caution should be taken when the integrated approach changes model struct ure because most survival analysis models, such as Cox's proportional hazards models and accelerated failure time models, are already complex nonlinear models with built-in failure mechanisms.  The model over-fitting may cause model identifiability  problems, which could be very subtle and hard to resolve 3\he integrated approach does not produce significant improvement in terms of model fitting or other measurements, which seemed to be the case in majority of the ANN approach to survival analysis, then the extra complication should certainly be avoided. Even if there is improvement, one should still take caution with the censor handling and model identifiability issues previously mentioned in \(1\ and \(2  3.2. Selected Papers Found in MMR-2004  In the following, we briefly review a few survival analysis related studies presented in a recent International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Reliability, MMR 2004 \(Wilson et al. 2005  Pena and Slate \(2005\ddressed the dynamic reliability Both reliability and survival times are more realistically described with dynamic models. Dynamic models generally refer to the models that incorporate the impact of actions or interventions as well as thei r accumulative history, which 


 17 can be monitored \(Pena and Slate 2005\he complexity is obviously beyond simple regression models, since the dependence can play a crucial ro le. For example, in a loadsharing network system, failure of a node will increase the loads of other nodes and influences their failures  Duchesne \(2005\uggested incorporating usage accumulation information into the regression models in survival analysis.  To simplify the model building Duchesne \(2005\umes that the usage can be represented with a single time-dependent covariate.  Besides reviewing the hazard-based regression models, which are common in survival analysis, Duchesne 2005\viewed three classes of less commonly used regression models: models based on transfer functionals, models based on internal wear and the so-called collapsible models. The significance of these regression models is that they expand reliability modeling to two dimensions. One dimension is the calendar time and the other is the usage accumulation.  Jin \(2005\ reviewed the recent development in statisti cal inference for accelerated failure time \(AFT\odel and the linear transformation models that include Cox proportional hazards model and proportional odds models as special cases. Two approaches rank-based approach and l east-squares approach were reviewed in Jin \(2005\. Osbo rn \(2005\d a case study of utilizing the remote diagnostic data from embedded sensors to predict system aging or degradation.  This example should indicate the potential of survival analysis and competing risks analysis in the prognostic and health management PHM\ since the problem Osborn \(2005 addressed is very similar to PHM. The uses of embedded sensors to monitor the health of complex systems, such as power plants, automobile, medical equipment, and aircraft engine, are common. The main uses for these sensor data are real time assessment of th e system health and detection of the problems that need immediate attention.  Of interest is the utilization of those remote diagnostic data, in combination with historical reliability data, for modeling the system aging or degradation. The biggest challenge with this task is the proper transformation of wear  time The wear is not only influenced by internal \(temperature, oil pressures etc\xternal covariates ambient temperature, air pressure, etc\, but also different each time   4  S UMMARY AND P ERSPECTIVE   4.1. Summary  Despite the common foundation with traditional reliability theory, such as the same probability definitions for survival function  S  t  and reliability  R  t  i.e  S  t  R  t well as the hazards function the exact same term and definition are used in both fields\rvival analysis has not achieved similar success in the field of reliability as in biomedicine The applications of survival analysis seem still largely limited to the domain of biomedicine.  Even in the sister fields of biomedicine such as biology and ecology, few applications have been conducted \(Ma 1997, Ma and Bechinski 2008\ the engin eering fields, the Meeker and Escobar \(1998\ monograph, as well as the Klein and Goel 1992\ to be the most comprehensive treatments  In Section 2, we reviewed the essential concepts and models of survival analysis. In Section 3, we briefly reviewed some application cases of survival analysis in engineering reliability.  In computer science, survival analysis seems to be still largely unknown.  We believe that the potential of survival analysis in computer science is much broader than network and/or software reliability alone. Before suggesting a few research topics, we no te two additional points  First, in this article, we exclusively focused on univariate survival analysis. There are two other related fields: one is competing risks analysis and the other is multivariate survival analysis The relationship between multivariate survival analysis and survival analysis is similar to that between multivariate statistical analysis and mathematical statistics.  The difference is that the extension from univariate to multivariate in survival analysis has been much more difficult than the developm ent of multivariate analysis because of \(1\rvation cens oring, and \(2\pendency which is much more complex when multivariate normal distribution does not hold in survival data.  On the other hand, the two essential differences indeed make multivariate survival analysis unique and ex tremely useful for analyzing and modeling time-to-event data. In particular, the advantages of multivariate survival analysis in addressing the dependency issue are hardly matched by any other statistical method.  We discuss competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis in separate articles \(Ma and Krings 2008a, b, & c  The second point we wish to note is: if we are asked to point out the counterpart of survival analysis model in reliability theory, we would suggest the shock or damage model.   The shock model has an even longer history than survival analysis and the simplest shock model is the Poisson process model that leads to exponential failure rate model The basic assumption of the shock model is the notion that engineered systems endure some type of wear, fatigue or damage, which leads to the failure when the strengths exceed the tolerance limits of th e system \(Nakagawa 2006 There are extensive research papers on shock models in the probability theory literature, but relatively few monographs The monograph by Nakagawa \(2006\s to be the latest The shock model is often formulated as a Renewal stochastic process or point process with Martingale theory The rigorous mathematical derivation is very similar to that of survival analysis from counting stochastic processes  which we briefly outlined in section 2.6  It is beyond the scope of the paper to compare the shock model with survival analysis; however, we would like to make the two specific comments. \(1\Shock models are essentially the stochastic process model to capture the failure mechanism based on the damage induced on the system by shocks, and the resulting statistical models are 


 18 often the traditional reliability distribution models such as exponential and Weibull failure distributions.  Survival analysis does not depend on specific shock or damage Instead, it models the failure with abstract time-to-event random variables.  Less restrictive assumptions with survival analysis might be more useful for modeling software reliability where the notions of fatigue, wear and damage apparently do not apply.  \(2\hock models do not deal with information censoring, the trademark of failure time data.  \(3\ Shock models, perhaps due to mathematical complexity, have not been applied widely in engineering reliability yet.  In contrast, the applications of survival analysis in biomedical fields are much extensive.  While there have been about a dozen monographs on survival analysis available, few books on shock models have been published.  We believe that survival analysis and shock models are complementary, a nd both are very needed for reliability analysis, with shock model more focused on failure mechanisms and the survival analysis on data analysis and modeling  4.2. Perspective   Besides traditional industrial and hardware reliability fields we suggest that the following fields may benefit from survival analysis  Software reliability Survival analysis is not based on the assumptions of wear, fatigue, or damage, as in traditional reliability theory.  This seems close to software reliability paradigm. The single biggest challenge in applying above discussed approaches to softwa re systems is the requirement for a new metric that is able to replace the survival time variable in survival analysis. This "time" counterpart needs to be capable of characterizing the "vulnerability" of software components or the system, or the distance to the next failure event. In other words, this software metric should represent the metric-to-event, similar to time-toevent random variable in survival analysis.  We suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(Li and Vitanyi 1997\n be a promising candidate. Once the metric-to-event issue is resolved, survival analysis, both univariate and multivariate survival analysis can be applied in a relative straightforward manner. We suggest that the shared frailty models are most promising because we believ e latent behavior can be captured with the shared fra ilty \(Ma and Krings 2008b  There have been a few applications of univariate survival analysis in software reliability modeling, including examples in Andersen et al.'s \(1995\ classical monograph However, our opinion is that without the fundamental shift from time-to-event to new metric-to-event, the success will be very limited. In software engineering, there is an exception to our claim, which is the field of software test modeling, where time variable may be directly used in survival analysis modeling  Modeling Survivability of Computer Networks As described in Subsection 2.3, random censoring may be used to model network survivability.  This modeling scheme is particularly suitable for wireless sensor network, because 1\ of the population nature of wireless nodes and \(2\ the limited lifetime of the wireless nodes.  Survival analysis has been advanced by the needs in biomedical and public health research where population is th e basic unit of observation As stated early, a sensor networ k is analogically similar to a biological population. Furthermore, both organisms and wireless nodes are of limited lifetimes. A very desirable advantage of survival analysis is that one can develop a unified mathematical model for both the reliability and survivability of a wireless sensor network \(Krings and Ma 2006  Prognostic and Health Management in Military Logistics PHM involves extensive modeling analysis related to reliability, life predictions, failure analysis, burnin elimination and testing, quality control modeling, etc Survival analysis may provide very promising new tools Survival analysis should be able to provide alternatives to the currently used mathematical tools such as ANN, genetic algorithms, and Fuzzy logic.  The advantage of survival analysis over the other alternatives lies in its unique capability to handle information censoring.  In PHM and other logistics management modeling, information censoring is a near universal phenomenon. Survival analysis should provide new insights and modeling solutions   5  R EFERENCES   Aalen, O.
