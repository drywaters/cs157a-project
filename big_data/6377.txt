A Case Study in Seeding Collaboration Transformation With Experience Themes  Faith McCreary, Marla Gomez Anne McEwan  IT User Experience Research  Intel Corporation  Portland, OR  USA   Susan Michalak  IT User Experience  Intel Corporation  Portland, OR, USA  C i ndy  Pickering  IT Collaboration Engineering  Intel Corporation  Chandler, AZ, USA   Deidre Ali  Human Centered Design  Emerson Net work Power  Columbus, OH USA     Abstract 000 Collaboration at Intel is currently in a stage of 
transformation with increased focus on using social computing and other technologies to boost collaborati on and productivity  This transformation requires a shift in the services IT provides and a solid understanding of the expectations that employees have of both their technology and the larg er environment in which collaboration happens  At the same time we have been given the mandate to Be Bold, and Act Fast, leaving little time for upfront user research and requiring us as UX professionals to re think how we enable project teams to be more  effective within this new reality  One approach that is being  used within IT to help product  design teams move more quickly is experience themes which package available user research for easier reuse 
The collaboration portfolio has been an early adopt er and used experience themes for the last year to help define the desired collaboration experience from upfront strategy  and back end architecture  to the design of individual products We will share  learnings on how to best use these concepts and discus s the benefits of having a re usable over arching experience vision in guiding product  decision making  Keywords C ollaboration Frameworks and Methodologies for Collaboration Architecture  and Design of Collaboration Systems Collaborative Human Centered  Systems

IT shops wanting to give the user a more uniform experience often define interface standards that prescribe color schemes fonts layouts and the like  While these standards are often successful at taming the visua l inconsistencies they do little to address the functional inconsistencies or to ensure that the many fragments come together in a coherent fashion  in support of collaboration   After years of trying to wrestle the individual components 
of the enterprise experience into some semblance of a usable experience, Intel IT took on an audacious goal to define a One IT experience that met both employee and customer needs Defining an  over arching enterprise user experience  UX  started  with having trusted data tha t can help set the direction While we well understood the value of traditional UX methods   1   2   3   4    we found over time that insights derived from these methods which are often elicited using small sample sizes that are not statistically significa nt for an enterprise   were often not trusted by  traditional IT  To increase trust and the 
likelihood of the larger IT organization acting on the resulting insights we decided to take a hybrid approach that would weave together the outputs of traditional UX methods with analysis of 000W\000K\000H\000\003 000R\000S\000H\000U\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000D\000O\000\003 000³\000E\000L\000J\000\003 000G\000D\000W\000D\000´\000\003 000W\000K\000D\000W\000\003 000H\000Q\000W\000H\000U\000S\000U\000L\000V\000H\000V\000\003 000F\000R\000O\000O\000H\000F\000W\000\003 about their users   5    6    7   Along with establishing a trusted data source  for optimizing the UX of IT systems we also generated a treasure trove of da ta about user behavio r and a frame of reference for testing the generalizability of UX insights  What started out as cross company research to develop a 000K\000R\000O\000L\000V\000W\000L\000F\000\003\000X\000Q\000G\000H\000U\000V\000W\000D\000Q\000G\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000Z\000K\000D\000W\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003\000F\000R\000P\000S\000D\000Q\000\\\000¶\000V\000\003 
more than 100K employees want and need evolved into a common language and fra mework that defines the One IT experience vision that spans the many products and services provided by corporate IT 8   The framework is  designed to help IT product teams more easily re use insights from user research and document user needs from high le vel themes They can then define roadmaps  usage models  and user requirements that will be mapped to design prototypes, underlying capabilities and technologies   In this paper we focus on the framework and research results that inform design and imple mentation of enterprise collaboration solutions S ection II  d iscuss es the experience research framework, approach, demographics

Each piece of data was linked to a specific user, and all data for an individual user was linked together.  As o ur foremost concern was protecting the privacy of employees prio r  to making any attempt to integrate the data sets, the raw data was anonymized by replacing all employee identifiers with an encrypted identifier  By organizing the data in terms of individuals we could more easily discern user patterns and connect new d ata as it is discovered  Best fit patterns were then identified based on similarities in how employees used and responded to IT solutions  Over a period of months the final 000 meta 000  patterns emerged and became the foundation of the experience framework  000x  T hemes or the core experiences that enterprise users wanted from the IT experience regardless of what product or service the user was interacting with  000x  Segments or groups of users with similar usage of enterprise systems, attitudes towards IT, and user n eeds  000x  Influencers or core elements of the enterprise 000H\000Q\000Y\000L\000U\000R\000Q\000P\000H\000Q\000W\000\017\000\003 000Z\000K\000R\000V\000H\000\003 000F\000K\000D\000U\000D\000F\000W\000H\000U\000L\000V\000W\000L\000F\000V\000\003 000L\000P\000S\000D\000F\000W\000\003 000W\000K\000H\000\003 000X\000V\000H\000U\000¶\000V\000\003 ability to accomplish work  \(e.g., culture  000x  Activities  or the high level tasks that all enterprise users engage in in order to accomplish work \(e g., find information  Together they define the over arching IT experience desired by employees  To aid decision making each component had experience objectives defined in terms of user minimum, target and outstanding expectations of that specific compo nent To use teams must first look for intersections between their product and the larger desired IT experience 8    The framework represented the first ever broad understanding of the IT experience that is re usable and extensible to a range of IT p roducts and services.   It provided a shared vocabulary and reference for discussing the enterprise experience that can be applied across individual enterprise products as well as the cumulative IT experience. By providing a common language for discussing the IT experience it facilitated cross product conversations helped democratize participation in UX and encouraged shared ownership of improving the larger IT experience  A  Seeding Action with  Stories  While the underlying data patterns were potentially powerful they did not lend themselves to easy re use in different contexts.  We needed teams to be able to zoom in and understand at a detailed level how the framework could help them reframe the experience of a specific product or service At the same t ime, we needed teams to be able to zoom out and assess how well their prod uct fit the larger experience   The supporting collateral for the framework needed to put  a face to the underlying big data and provide IT with an actionable experience vision to driv e product design   Key to the successful use of the experience framework  has been the introduction of large scale layered storytelling as an underlying unifier across the supporting collateral  By necessity, the underlying stories focus on particular el ements of the dataset and ignore the rest  Strung together they map the larger IT experience but individually only tell a piece  The data set is simply too large and diverse to be told by a single story  The stories associated with different pieces  pro vide different insights  and follow different models   Users of the framework  then take these stories and underlying data to create their own stories that are relevant to what they are trying to accomplish many stories are possible from the same data Much  has been learned in the last year about how to most effectively use this information with product teams and the collateral has iteratively evolved to better support the layered storytelling necessary to make sense of this mountain of data For the framew 000R\000U\000N\000¶\000V\000\003\000S\000R\000W\000H\000Q\000W\000L\000D\000O\000\003\000W\000R\000\003\000E\000H\000\003\000U\000H\000D\000O\000L 000H 000G\000\017 000\003 we needed to socialize it through  presentations social media workshops and training with everyone from portfolio owners technical strategists UX apprentices and practitioners architects and IT staff Socialization has b een an iterative 73 


process requiring persistence and refinement of our messaging and  collateral for different roles within the organization  B  Seeding Shared Understanding  Experience themes helped the collaboration portfolio team understand the shared expectat ions that employees have of both the collaboration environment as well as their interactions with social computing tools.  There are three key experience themes that employees expect all social computing solutions to satisfy  000x  Feed Me   I quickly and easily find the information I need to speed my work and my life  000x  Connect Me   Connect me with the people resources and expertise I need to be successful at Intel  000x  Know Me   My  information is known and protected  by Intel   my information  is used to improve provi ded services  Of the three Connect Me has the strongest affinity to the overall collaboration portfolio  To increase the ease of applying an experience theme to a specific product or service the themes are further broken into qualities that define the essential experience principles needed to bring a specific theme to life  Each quality  include s  key usage elements and desired functionality  They were packaged 000D\000V\000\003\000T\000X\000D\000O\000L\000W\000\\\000\003\000³\000W\000U\000D\000G\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000F\000D\000U\000G\000V\000´\000\003 to  provide tangible artifacts for teams to u se while defining  UX st rategy and solution  roadmaps  In order to provide sufficient detail to fuel product teams experience qualities were decomposed into elements Elements specify the key usages that make up a quality including user scenarios user requirements relative im portance illustrative examples and any user differences  They were packaged in theme vision books and as 8x10 cards to facilitate use in face to face design sessions  Together the t hree themes 12 qualities 59 elements and many hundreds of user req uirements detail the envisioned experience  By mapping the intersection between experience qualities and elements against portfolio and product roadmaps teams can identify potential gaps between the planned and desired experience for the products in thei r portfolio  Table I  maps employee expectations related to collaboration from the Connect Me theme  C  Seeding Shared User Models  Segments provide a common cast of characters for IT teams creating enterprise experiences Segments are groups of users with s imilar usage of enterprise systems attitudes towards IT and user needs  Of all the framework building blocks the adoption curve for segments was the shortest with teams readily seeing the value of knowing the pain points and IT usage patterns of their  target audiences  Each segment has a persona family that represents it 000S\000H\000U\000V\000R\000Q\000D\000V\000\003 000S\000X\000W\000\003 000D\000\003 000³\000I\000D\000F\000H\000´\000\003 000W\000R\000\003 000W\000K\000H\000\003 000H\000Q\000W\000H\000U\000S\000U\000L\000V\000H\000\003 000X\000V\000H\000U\000\003 000V\000H\000J\000P\000H\000Q\000W\000V\000\021\000\003 0007\000K\000H\000\\\000\003 provide summary information on user characteristics, goals and needs, key tasks and behaviors, pain points, use of IT pro ducts and relative priority of different experience qualities The collateral ranges from persona family posters contextual scenarios individual personas day in the life 000 s and trading cards  Although IT experience themes are based on research with tho usands of employees and apply to all IT products, how they apply to individual employee segments may vary depending on activity, e.g., collaboration.

D  Seeding a Future Vision of Collaboration  The experience framework is a representation of the desi red future of the enterprise from the user perspective.  It provides a thinking model for those who make the day to day decisions that define the enterprise It encourages them to look beyond their immediate challenges past the boundaries of what they ar e responsible  for  and consider the holistic experience from the perspective of enterprise users  This big data look at the employee experience has provided significant insights as to what employees want and need from Intel IT related to collaboration Ke y opportunities for improving collaboration that emerged included  000x  Make use of collaboration tools easier through  seamless integration of tools, a single center of gravity for accessing and managing collaborations consumer grade experiences and increased  support for sense making across multiple activity streams  000x  Make finding experts or expertise easier through  personalized recommendations more transparent security, and making connections more visible  000x  Increased personal interactions with more opportuni ties to collaborate in person higher fidelity virtual alternatives, and increased access to video  000x  Create a more supportive culture for collaboration through  more leadership support and role modeling of best approaches including discipline collaboration  9     III  TURNING  UNDERSTANDING  INTO  TRANSFORMATION  The framework was intended to seed the envisioned experience into existing processes by providing a shared vocabulary and shared ways of examining the enterprise  We encouraged teams to selectively apply dif ferent pieces of the framework depending on where they were in their existing processes To help guide enterprise  professionals in incorporating the framework into their processes, we proposed the following iterative approach with the outputs of the last step feed ing  back into the first  000x  Evaluate what is  Use segments to better understand users and theme s  and associated components   to determine how well current reality is meeting user needs   000x  Ask what if  Use relevant theme components to start the co nversation with users stakeholders and team s  and to envision possible new futures  000x  Prioritize what is most needed  Use the experience objectives and the outputs of previous steps to set UX strategy, define roadmaps, and identify gaps   000x  Define the detail   Use framework personas requirements scenarios and related design patterns to define what a product or service would do  We stressed that framework insights were not a replacement for what was already known but instead were additive.  We set the exp ectation that the framework would not answer all their questions and any gaps in understanding would need to be filled  using traditional UX methods   2  3  4   A  Seeding Agility with Presumptive Design  The IT collaboration portfolio team further evolved  this approach by combining this experience framework with e lements of presumptive design 4    T he  e xpe r i e nc e  t he m e s   along with what was already known about a particular audience e.g field sales   000I\000R\000U\000P\000X\000O\000D\000W\000H\000G\000\003 000W\000K\000H\000\003 000V\000W\000D\000U\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\003 000³\000S\000U\000H\000V\000X\000P\000S\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000V\000´\000\003 000R\000Q\000\003 which design s were based  These starting presumptions were then validated using low cost methods and prototypes   The exact validation approach varied depending on the level of the collaboration facet under scrutiny e.g portfolio strategy product experience bu t regardless of approach there was a shared focus on quick low cost ways to expose presumptions to potential users and have them respond  B  Validating Strategic Direction  The IT collaboration portfolio team led a recent  corporate strategic discussion CSD  with exe cutive management  The discussion content pulled heavily from the information that formed the original basis for the IT Experience Themes However the original data was almost nine months old so many of the most recent hires into Intel were not represented by the information.

Crowdsourcing is the practice of soliciting feedback on a subject from a large group of people through an online community The general concept is to combine  the efforts of many participants, where each one contributes a small portion which then creates a relatively large or significant result.  It is definitely a guerilla method of employee research meaning it is quick and dirty but still gathers lots of us eful data\.  It is also fast for employees and takes only a matter of minutes versus an hour or so for more traditional user research methods  A 10 day bounded crowdsourcing was used to gather ideas on how Intel can better leverage the combined intellige nce of employees to improve collaboration and increase velocity at Intel.  We asked questions in four categories that we presumed to be the primary problem areas related to collaboration  000x  Velocity of innovation  000x  Barriers to working together  000x  External best pr actices we should integrate within Intel  000x  Finding the right people to collaborate with  44 percent of the threads related to organizational barriers 45 percent to technology, 7 percent to people, and 4 percent to the physical workspace  The crowdsourcing r esults aligned with 000R\000W\000K\000H\000U\000\003\000U\000H\000V\000H\000D\000U\000F\000K\000\003\000Z\000H\000¶\000G\000\003\000F\000R\000Q\000G\000X\000F\000W\000H\000G\000\017\000\003\000Z\000K\000L\000F\000K\000\003\000I\000R\000X\000Q\000G\000\003\000W\000K\000D\000W\000\003\000\032\000\026\000\003\000S\000H\000U\000F\000H\000Q\000W\000\003\000R\000I\000\003 employees talked about how collaboration hel ps them feel engaged at work  10, 11     75 


C  Identifying Goals and Priorities  the Portfolio  The experience themes and their underlyi ng components were diagrammed into a wall sized mind map format Meanwhile the portfolio UX teams had compiled deep dive research in the context of specific business groups and projects Using sticky notes and highlighters we added in data that we found  from the deep dive research  where it intersected with the experience themes and components   We also found a few small nuances that we added to the mind map and noted the sources so we could go back to them  Next   we reviewed the mind map and looked for nuances related to particular audiences or segments  Figure 1  shows a portion of the  combined picture tha t highlights what was in common along with gaps that we needed to resolve  for Connect Me  theme Presence  000T\000X\000D\000O\000L\000W\000\\\000\003 000D\000Q\000G\000\003 000W\000K\000H\000\003 000³\0006\000H\000H\000\003 000Z\000K\000R\000\003 000,\000\003 000D\000P\000\003 000Z\000R\000U\000N\000L\000Q\000J\000´\000\003 000Z\000L\000W\000K\000\003 e lement which mapped to pervasive video capabilities  Next, we used the mind  map and the underlying user needs defined by experience qualities and elements to get the portfolio design process started.  To help define the portfolio 000¶\000V  collaboration gaps and p riorities  we isolated the elements relevant to collaboration and developed a he at map Key questions included  H 000R\000Z\000\003 000Z\000H\000O\000O\000\003 000D\000U\000H\000\003 000W\000R\000G\000D\000\\\000¶\000V\000\003 000F\000D\000S\000D\000E\000L\000O\000L\000W\000L\000H\000V\000\003 000P\000H\000H\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\003 target requirements for each collaboration element How important are each of those elements to our us ers? Answers to those two questions would help us prioritize where to focus development energy first.  We relied heavily on the minimum target, and outstanding requirements that were defined for each quality and element from the themes   This importance r ating of requirements was based on the relative frequency of requirements across the underlying research and the importance that employees placed on the requirement  For each experience element related to collaboration we looked across the portfolio an d identified which capabilities and services currently addressed the requirements and at the      same time identified where the gaps were  For example an 000H\000O\000H\000P\000H\000Q\000W\000\003 000F\000U\000L\000W\000L\000F\000D\000O\000\003 000W\000R\000\003 000L\000Q\000L\000W\000L\000D\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\003 000F\000R\000O\000O\000D\000E\000R\000U\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003 000L\000V\000\003 000³\000%\000X\000P\000S\000\003 000L\000Q\000W\000R\000\003 000,\000Q\000W\000H\000U\000H\000V\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\017\000´\000\003\000Z\000K\000L\000F\000K\000\003\000L\000V\000\003\000D\000E\000R\000X\000W\000\003\000K\000H\000O\000S\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000X sers serendipitously bump into information or people that are interesting and useful to them We looked across the portfolio and identified which capabilities and services currently addressed the requirements 000I\000R\000U\000\003 000³\000%\000X\000P\000S\000\003 000L\000Q\000W\000R\000\003 000,\000Q\000W\000H\000U\000H\000V\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\021\000´\000\003 000,\000Q\000\003 000W\000K\000L\000V\000\003 000F\000D\000V\000H\000\017\000\003 000Z\000H\000\003 000I ound that the 000S\000R\000U\000W\000I\000R\000O\000L\000R\000\003\000G\000L\000G\000Q\000¶\000W\000\003\000K\000D\000Y\000H\000\003\000D\000Q\000\\\000\003\000V\000R\000O\000X\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000V\000\003\000W\000K\000D\000W\000\003\000Z\000H\000U\000H\000\003\000P\000H\000H\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003 target requirements 000 that is presenting people and resources to the 000X\000V\000H\000U\000\003 000E\000D\000V\000H\000G\000\003 000R\000Q\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003 000X\000V\000H\000U\000¶\000V\000\003 000F\000X\000U\000U\000H\000Q\000W\000\003 000F\000R\000Q\000Q\000H\000F\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000V\000\017\000\003 000W\000K\000H\000\003 000F\000R\000P\000P\000X\000Q\000L\000W\000L\000H\000V\000\003 that they follow, and t heir online activity.

They are like any model, a simplification, but even so and with supporting collateral project teams can still find them unwieldy to work with unless they have had coaching prior to interacting with them  There are multiple challenges with undertakin g an effort of this size  Designing great collaboration solutions is as much about getting and analyzing data as it is about transforming an 000R\000U\000J\000D\000Q\000L 000D 000W 000L 000R\000Q\000\003 000W 000R\000\003 000D 000F 000W 000X\000D 000O 000O 000 000\003 000X 000V 000H 000\003 000L 000W 000\003 000H 000I 000I 000H 000F 000W 000L 000Y 000H 000O 000 000\021\000\003 000 000W 000 000V 000\003 000D 000\003 000M 000R\000X\000U 000Q\000H 000 000\003 000D 000Q\000G\000\003 000D 000\003 process 000  not a silver bullet It requires joint  partnership and extensive collaboration across multiple disciplines Despite best efforts, the challenges of use are only expected to grow.

A  Trapped in Flat Space  To date, the majority of experience theme collateral resides in flat files or posts in social media forums  The underlying hierarchical structure of the deep storytelling defined by the collateral can be obscured by the media in which they resi de While physical artifacts are often needed for kickoff or face to face sessions online access  and an effective search  is also needed  We have experimented with using a wiki as a knowledge delivery system for the framework  but  by definition it is a s ite  where people go to collaborate on content  which typically contains  few graphics The framework is a definitive document   and while w e encourage linking of additional information  the framework content must remain unchanged  Additionally, the framewo rk is highly visual with data graphics personas and design examples which do not lend themselves to the content heavy wiki format  nor is there a simple mechanism for turning existing, highly readable content into wiki pages, so it increases our workload    B  Enabling Social Storytelling  Today, storytelling with the underlying big data is primarily limited to the research team that produced the experience themes or the UX professionals who work directly with them The rich data available on individuals spe cific job roles different organizations and even geographic areas makes possible a great many more stories than what is currently embedded in the experience themes  However the lack of 000³\000V\000H\000O\000I 000V\000H\000U\000Y\000L\000F\000H\000´\000\003 000H\000Q\000Y\000L\000U\000R\000Q\000P\000H\000Q\000W\000V\000\003 000W\000R\000\003 000H\000Q\000D\000E\000O\000H\000\003 000X\000W\000L\000O\000L 000D 000W 000L 000R 000Q\000\003 000R\000I 000\003 000W 000K\000H 000\003 000G\000D 000W 000D 000\003 limit s utilization of the data within larger IT  Additionally IT teams often need to understand how the overarching information about the employee experience intersects with data specific to an IT product or service in order to discover new insights about em ployee expectations of their product and how their product need s  to align with the over arching IT experience  Today this is also a manual process that can require substantive manipulation to ensure the 000O\000L\000P\000L\000W\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000V\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000W\000R\000G\000D\000\\\000¶\000V\000\003\000D\000Q\000D\000O\000\\\000V\000L\000V\000\003\000W\000R\000R\000O\000V\000\003\000D\000U\000H\000\003\000Q\000R\000W\000\003\000H\000[\000F\000H\000H ded   C  Fostering Knowledge Sharing  P roject teams are not just re using existing knowledge, they are adding to it by creating detailed stories of use in specific contexts and potentially doing additional research that may lend themselves to re use by other IT teams focused on the same audience  While the experience framework provides a skeleton for sharing information, this structure has not yet been brought to life online and no easy methods exist for teams wanting to share their stories and associated des igns.  Until that happens widespread sharing and associated efficiencies is unlikely to occur  Knowledge sharing is further inhibited by the siloed nature of most IT shops.  Each dataset incorporated in the framework requires individual negotiation and data from different areas is often incompatible incomprehensible and messy to tie together  Additionally users of the framework seldom share the experience artifacts built on top of the framework whether personas scenarios or design patterns  Su ccess requires shifting the mindset of UX professionals  to look past individual methods  and products  and look holistically at the enterprise experience to be comfortable with leveraging re usable insights about their users, and to accept that  these insigh ts can be successfully packaged for re use by traditional IT professionals     D  Exponentially Increasing Big Data  Lastly although collateral growth is beginning to stabilize based on active use by IT project teams, the underlying data set is expected to gr ow even more rapidly in coming years as analysis tools become capable of handling even larger data sets Only about 30 of available user transactional data has been incorporated in the current framework and the amount of data continues to increase on a daily basis further exacerbating the challenges of re use and sense making by IT project teams at large  E  Experience Driven Change is a Journey  Even with an over arching experience framework and strong leadership commitment to change collaboration at Intel  experience driven transformation is a journey and what works for one team or individual may not work for another.  It takes time and resources It takes a willingness to collaborate with the rest of the organization to find approaches that work  It requ ires recognizing that every team or individual is starting from a different point of faith and understanding of what UX is and how to do it. To do this, we have all had to transform our thinking, our approach, our decisions, and actions 000  from how we do us er research to defining portfolio strategy to individual decisions made on enterprise projects all the way up to architectural decisions and overall strategy decisions for the IT organization   V  D ISCUSSION AND R ESULTS  The experience framework is an innova tive way to represent UX research in a way that is consumable within the enterprise The framework is being used across various levels of the collaboration portfolio It is feeding collaboration portfolio strategy technical architecture plans and the des ign of specific products.  As a result, new learnings have emerged about how to most effectively integrate into the portfolio strategy and design which in turn has resulted in the development of new supporting collateral.  Key lessons learned include  000x  When  first introducing a team to the underlying concepts having them use the qualities to evaluate their own product or service is key to learning and provides a baseline for future improvements  000x  For setting product vision and strategy experience qualities are paramount They spark conversation and provide easy user functionality checklists that can be incorporated into user experience roadmaps  000x  Product teams once they get past the original strategizing and into design need the more detailed experience e lement cards that provide one place to access user requirements scenarios and key audience differences  78 


000x  Having sample designs that satisfy the themes is important they serve as a baseline for conversations about how the pattern can be improved or spa rk a new idea  000x  Different people have different learning styles and different teams have different ways to work together 000,\000I\000\003\000F\000R\000O\000O\000D\000W\000H\000U\000D\000O\000\003\000G\000R\000H\000V\000Q\000¶\000W\000\003\000U\000H\000V\000R\000Q\000D\000W\000H\000\017\000\003\000L\000W\000H\000U\000D\000W\000H\000\017\000\003\000L\000W\000H\000U\000D\000W\000H\000\017\000\003\000L\000W\000H\000U\000D\000W\000H\000\021  We also have found that in the early stages of an effort, a hard copy of c ollateral is often key to their successful use during project kickoffs.  Generating design ideas is often fastest when you have hardcopy of element cards and other experience theme collateral so the team 000F\000D\000Q\000\003\000³\000U\000H 000X\000V\000H\000´\000\003\000F\000R\000O\000O\000D\000W\000H\000U\000D\000O\000\003\000H\000O\000H\000P\000H\000Q\000W\000V\000\003\000L\000Q\000\003 paper prototypes   We have seen the value add of the principles of presumptive design and the agile process to experience themes At their most basic, they provide a foundational understanding of the needs of different kinds of employees in spaces that lack the time or re sources to invest in more traditional user research The themes also mitigate some of the key risks associated with presumptive design by pr o v i di ng a l a r g e r hol i s t i c l ook a t t he  experience space and overarching prioritization that helps prevent teams  from focusing on the wrong solution to design or ignoring the needs of the larger experience into which a design must fit  However use of experience themes does come at a cost Newcomers to experience themes can easily lose their way in the multi laye red story  Coaching or training on experience themes is needed before teams dive into their use  Some understanding of how the pieces fit together helps teams more quickly and effectively integrate themes into their existing process.  Often times the fir st exposure may feel overwhelming and only in follow up discussions do the pieces click  But when they do click they substantially speed teams from strategy definition to design  Furthermore experience themes provide IT with common target experiences and shared understanding of target users that can be leveraged across IT services and portfolios  not just collaboration This shared vision has the potential to transform IT product and services resulting in a more cohesive and usable 1 IT experience tha t could increase the velocity of teams across Intel  VI  C ONCLUSIONS  By far, the biggest potential value offered by IT Experience Themes is increased velocity Imagine the time gained by having productive team discussions that generate strategy and design idea s faster because the team is referencing a common framework and language that can be understood by all This recent work with experience themes can lead the way for other teams both in IT and in broader Intel to more effectively use experience themes to dr ive service strategy and design  However the framework results in significant change in the over arching IT experience  only when the finds are communicated in a way that resonates with the broad base of people who work together to define and develop the enterprise experience.  An architect will look at the framework collateral through  a different lens than a systems analyst or service owner  Further the framework seeds change  only through  a participatory process 000 it is not something that can be done by m erely throwing the framework over the fence at those outside of UX  For change to happen all levels of the organization must participate in the conversation and take ownership of how their own role impacts the enterprise experience  The large scale laye red storytelling approach allows experience theme users to explore the underlying data below the surface level of themes to find their own meaning and seeds design investigations of features and possible interaction models This approach to socializing and  utilizing experience themes provides a practical model for the creators of other types of experience themes to more quickly trigger transformation in their own spaces  A CKNOWLEDGMEN TS   We wou ld like to thank Jayne May who was instrumental in evolving the framework collateral  We would also like to thank the HR Employee Centered Solutions team that helped gather data for the original research that spawned the framework  Lastly we would like to thank Linda Wooding  who headed  000,\000Q\000W\000H\000O\000\003 000,\0007\000¶\000V\000\003 User Experience  tea m for without her belief and support this work  would not have been possible  R EFERENCES    A.

Size of Largeincrease The reasons are twofold Firstly when increases according to the node selection scheme to construct decrease There are two reasons Firstly when the memory size increases the stop condition for graph contraction is easier to be satis\336ed since more nodes can 336t in memory Secondly when the memory size increases the costs of the external sorts in both graph contraction and graph expansion phases decrease  Average Degree Number of Largeincreases the time and I/O consumptions for both increases the number of iterations in graph contraction increases This is because when number of edges increases the cost to sort and scan edges in each iteration increases thus more time and I/Os are consumed in each iteration                                     2 4 1 u E  V v E    u v

memory model In the internal memory model strongly connected components of a directed graph can be computed in s for a directed graph with the assumption that the nodes of the graph cannot reside entirely in memory We overcome the de\336ciencies of the existing external    sort sort computation algorithms and propose a new two-phase algorithm with graph contraction followed by graph expansion We analyze the I/O cost of our approach and show that our algorithm can signi\336cantly reduce the number of random I/Os We propose techniques to further reduce the I/O cost of our algorithm and
