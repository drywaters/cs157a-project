In fact, the sensors for monitoring and fault detection, the switches for maneuvering and network reconfiguration, the Low Voltage distribution board where all the information of the Low Voltage network may be collected, including 
metering data, the transformer, the communication equipments for Low Voltage and Medium Voltage\205.; are physically placed in the secondary transformer station. So the Smart TStation will play a mayor role in the practical implementation of the SmartGrids  The paper describes a new architecture proposal based on functional modularity of the future Smart TStation. The proposal takes into account, not only the functional aspects needed for the SmartGrids\222 future challenges, but also the real considerations for a big scale successful implementation. Its main features are easy installation and integration, no works on site, no specialized workforce for commissioning, independency on the point of the network 
where it is installed, scalable and open to future additional features. The proposed architecture considers every functional element, integrating the Smart TStation including its own complete functionality. So, cubicles transformers, capacitor banks, Low Voltage boards, power electronic devices, etc. have their own smart behavior and will be interconnected through a local bus  INTRODUCTION  Nowadays there are several large projects to implement Advanced Meter Management \(AMM projects are being developed by the electrical utilities and they basically contemplate the aspects of replacement of meters and the deployment of their associated 
communication.  The meters are replaced by \223smart\224 meters that automate the collection of usage data. The communication of these \223smart\224 meters with a centralized system is carried out utilizing different media, being the use of the Power Line Communication 1  2  in the Low Voltage  network one of the most accepted. The information of all the meters associated to a MV/LV transformer is collected in the secondary transformer station. The information in each transformer station is exchanged with a central system 
in order to feed a general database of all the meters. There are different types of communication 3 currently being used between the transformer stations and the central system GPRS, PLC, Fibre Optics, etc  Due to the infrastructure of communications that have to be deployed in this type of project, a great possibility to the implementation of other type of functions is opened otherwise unaffordable economically in an individual way Clear examples of these functions are the automation of the Medium Voltage networks 4 
fault location, remote alarms indication, etc. The implementation of these functions is quite small in the distribution networks, because the communications of each simple installation is not viable most of the times  Therefore, there is a real opportunity for the SmartGrids in places where the AMM projects are being deployed. It has to take into account that the implementations of future functions are conditioned by AMM system design. This paper invites to a reflection on some critical aspects in order to clearly facilitate the implementation of future functions in a systematic and optimized way 
 CRITICAL POINTS  In general, the proposed systems for AMM functions in the projects carried out nowadays, introduce a main electronic device to be installed in the secondary transformer station  Fig.1. Functions Integrated in the Main Device    CIRED Seminar 2008: SmartGrids for Distr ibution Paper No  59 Page 1 / 4 


  C I R E D  CIRED Seminar 2008: SmartGrids for Distribution Frankfurt, 23 - 24 June 2008  Paper 59   This main electronic device communicates with the smart meters, via Power Line Communication, concentrating all the information. The device is directly connected to the Low Voltage busbars. This information is sent to a central system via modem, which is commonly integrated inside the main device. Additionally, a set of digital and analogical inputs and outputs is  incorporated with the purpose of manoeuvring the switches of the installation for distribution automation functions, measurements of current and voltage for load records, fault detection, etc. Therefore, all these functions are grouped in one electronic device initially oriented to AMM functions, taking advantage of its great digital processing capability in order to include possible future functions  It may be observed in this type of installations that no indepth reflection has been made on the real possibilities of utilization of these additional functions.  From a functional point of view all features seem operative, but when a practical deployment is undertaken, some critical points are detected and the use of the majority of these additional functions is not possible. Even the communications network that is deployed with the initial purpose of AMM functions may turn out to be useless for functions of automation remote alarm indication, equipment auto-diagnostics, etc or to incur in associated extra adaptation costs  Transformer Substation Earthing Systems   The first point to have into account in a secondary transformer MV/LV station, from the electrical point of view, is the earthing system. In summary, we could say that there is a protection earthing system for safety aspects of the installation where all the accessible metallic envelopes of the equipment are directly connected. So, all accessible parts inside the installation have equal-potential, even under fault conditions. On the other hand, another earthing system is defined for the Low Voltage network and it is independent from the protection one. The Low Voltage earthing system is connected to the start point of the transformer in the Low Voltage side and it is the electrical potential reference to earth of the Low Voltage network. In general these earthing systems have to be independent in order not to transfer the overvoltage of the installation to the customers in case of a fault, with the consequent risks for people and goods. This detail has a clear reflection on the isolation voltages that are demanded for the different components connected to the Low Voltage network installed in transformer stations \(LV side of the transformer LV protection board, LV neutral interconnection, etc  This determining factor implies that the equipments connected or referred to the electrical potentials of both earthing systems at the same time have to take into account the levels of isolation required Otherwise, they become the most critical point for this type of overvoltage decreasing the levels of isolation, with the consequent risk for the integrity of all the installation \(an example is internal arcs in the Low Voltage busbars where the PLC signals are connected  Therefore, the practical application of the additional functions described previously of the devices oriented to AMM is not always possible. The main electronic device should include the levels of isolation of the installations in which it is integrated, that in some cases go up to 10kV   Fig. 2. Earthing System of Secondary Transformer Station  Reliable Auxiliary Supply   A reliable auxiliary supply is a critical point for some functions of the SmartGrids. From an AMM functionality point of view, it is not necessary for the system to fully operate in the event of an outage in the Low Voltage network.  In this case, there is no auxiliary supply from the Low Voltage side of the MV/LV transformer and the electronic equipment may not operate. The only consequence is that there is no communication with the central system. No critical function has to be carried out using AMM functions during the absence of voltage period In fact, in many of the AMM projects, it is assumed that in the case of absence of voltage in the low Voltage network the smart meters and the main electronic equipment concentrator\er station do not work during this period. This point is very different when automation functions are involved, where an outage in the Medium Voltage network is associated to an outage in the Low Voltage network which implies no auxiliary supply. It is during this outage period when the automation functions are more necessary.  Therefore, it is necessary to have a reliable auxiliary power supply to provide energy to the control equipment, communications system and switching elements. In automated transformer stations the energy is usually stored in batteries. They operate mainly in stand-by mode and they contribute to supply the devices when an outage in Low Voltage occurs    CIRED Seminar 2008: SmartGrids for Distr ibution Paper No  59 Page 2 / 4 


  C I R E D  CIRED Seminar 2008: SmartGrids for Distribution Frankfurt, 23 - 24 June 2008  Paper 59   Therefore, reliable auxiliary supply is necessary in the electronic and the communications systems when automation functions are present  Flexibility and Scalability   The electrical distribution network presents a series of singularities according to the voltage level. In the lower voltage levels the number of installations is significantly higher, their complexity is drastically reduced and personnel involved in the work on site normally have no special skills These factors have to be taken into account when deploying a system concerning hundreds of thousands or more installations. The deployment of AMM projects have to include flexibility and scalability for the addition of new functions from the practical point of view of its implementation. This segmentation allows a practical deployment of different functions inside the same installation where the personnel, equipment and processes are clearly independent  SmartGrids functions are very different from a technical point of view and from the processes involved. Therefore different agents and different technologies are mixed in the same installations. For example, the evolution of network assets diagnostics like cables, tr ansformers, circuit-breakers etc. is a task that all the manufacturers of the equipment are affording, and this diagnostics are clearly related to the nature of each component. The diagnostics seem to be more effective if the data is processed at the component level and the final and useful elaborated information is transferred to a central system to be used local or remotely. Therefore, the installations have to be prepared not to limit the future individual functions in each component. They are in constant evolution and if they are included completely in the main device it will clearly limit the implementation of future features and this solution clearly presents disadvantages from the flexibility and scalability point of view  PROPOSAL OF ARCHITECTURE An answer to the critical points previously detailed is the modular architecture. This paper\222s proposal is to define the SmartGrids functions from the point of view of its practical implementation. The modules are defined not only by their functionality but also by their physical implementation in the secondary transformer station. It allows the deployment to be separated into the different processes of communication, AMM, automation, alarm indication, asset diagnostics, etc. each of them independent and without interferences from one to another. Therefore, a massive installation could be carried out with different degrees of implementation which would not alter the final functionality. New modules may be added without the need to replace or modify exiting equipment and services  A very important aspect of the proposal is that the communication network is unique and it may be used by the modules in an independent way  In figure 3 the proposed architecture is observed. The secondary transformer station is a node of an IP network and it is accessed by the corresponding physical medium This is the WAN connection to the communication module The IP network supports the different protocols of the modules in an independent way. This module includes the modems, information routeing and switching functions. It also includes an isolated auxiliary supply. Its function is to collect the information from the rest of the installation. It forms an Ethernet network with the rest of the modules and the interconnection between them is logically and physically standardised including information interchange and auxiliary supply. This standardisation of the interconnection between modules allows the connection of every module to every port in the communication module in an independent way.  This module is independent of the type of installation and the function initially implemented. It allows the physical and logical installation of the module with a systematic procedure and by specialized personnel in communication   Fig. 3. Modular Architecture  The AMM module includes the concentration of all the information of the smart meters and its associated functions It is interconnected to the communication module in order to interchange the information and to supply the module. As described before, the interconnection is standardised physically and logically and is independent of the type of module  The automation module includes the reliable auxiliary supply, the remote terminal unit, the interconnection to the switching elements, etc. and it is connected to the communication module by the standard interconnection described before  The diagnostics module includes the partial discharge temperature, current and voltage sensors, and the equipment to process the data. The useful elaborated information and   CIRED Seminar 2008: SmartGrids for Distr ibution Paper No  59 Page 3 / 4

On the other hand, it is also important to define the systematic process of the installation and testing oriented to the personnel that really carry out this type of work in electrical distribution. In many cases, these tasks are carried out by small local businesses at low cost, but it has the inconvenient of a high rotation of people, poor skills, no specialization and minimum technical resources CONCLUSIONS The deployment of large AMM projects in the electrical distribution networks is an opportunity like it never has existed before, to direct the process of change toward the SmarGrids.  These projects are being deployed at a global level and they are of great interest for all of the electrical sector community.  The problem shown in this paper is that there has not been enough reflection on the steps to follow for the functions of the SmartGrid to become a reality, and to avoid that these functions remain as a possible annotation for the future in the projects of AMM.  Therefore, this reflection intends to open the debate to solve the upcoming steps in the implementation of the functions so commented but not massively implemented in electrical distribution networks such as automation, fault location, asset diagnostics, remote alarm indication, etc. The proposed architecture is one of the po ssible examples of scalability and realistic gradual investment for an optimum and orderly massive deployment    Fig. 4.

6 Safety Properties There are a variety of different semantics and models for CSP processes We concentrate on the trace model and the failure model in this work In a trace model a process is represented by the sequences of communications or events it can perform In the stable failures model a process is represented by its failures A failure for a process P  is given by a pair  s X   where s is a trace of P and X is a set of things it can refuse to perform after performing s  We intend to provide some desired safety and liveness properties for the hospital AIDC system We will provide the speciìcations for a CSP process by providing the most nondeterministic process satisfying the speciìcation The CSP process for a hospital AIDC system satisìes a speciìcation S if the CSP process P representing the speciìcation is reìned by the AIDC system process We will consider two different types of reìnement trace reìnement for safety properties and failure reìnement for liveness properties  A process Q is a trace reìnement of another process P  denoted by P  T Q if traces  Q   traces  P   A process Q is a failure reìnement of another process P  denoted by P  F Q if failures  Q   F failures  P   If we have a process P and its safety speciìcation S and we have S  T P  then we can say P is a safe process as all its traces are traces of the speciìcation so no bad event can be performed by P  Similarly failure reìnement can be used to express liveness properties We now express the environment of a hospital AIDC system as the collection of all the identiìcation tags representing the devices and patients and the devices sending out the readings for patients together with the electronic records system These are the given components which we cannot control Given   d  Dev Dev  d     p  Pat Pat  p   BTDevs  EHR We shall refer to the combination of all instances of nurses and medical mediators as the system It is important that only one nurse have use a medical mediator at a time This is reîected in our speciìcation by allowing each medical mediator to choose a nurse System   m   n  Nurse  n m     y  x.y  HCI n m x    Med  n m     y  x.y  EHRCh m x    EHRInterface   y 012 nmpdx y   RFIDChan n p x  y   EHRBECh m x  y   BTAddr n,m d x  y   BTScan m x   System In the system we hide away almost all internal and interelement communication The only events that we are interested in are the actual scanning of patient and device identiìer tags and the ultimate sending of the medical measurement to the EHR for storage after it has been veriìed by the nurse We now provide the safety speciìcation for the hospital AIDC system where the speciìcation ensures that if a tuple of data is entered into a database stating that a particular device d was used to take a reading x from a patient p by a nurse n  then it had been the case that the nurse n did identify p and d and had taken a medical measurement x from the patient p using d after identifying them Safety   m   n  p  d  RFIDChan n,m p  IDnum  p     RFIDChan n,m d  IDnum  d      RFIDChan n,m d  IDnum  d     RFIDChan n,m p  IDnum  p      Skip   BTScan m  X   Skip   if BTAddr n,m d  X then  BTAddr n,m d  r   Skip  EHRBECh m   n m IDnum  p   IDnum  d  EHR  r   Skip  else Skip  Safety Now we are ready to specify the desired safety and liveness properties Let Vis   y   ndx.y  RFIDChan n,m d x     mz.y  EHRBECh m z    The properties then are as follows Safety    Vis    Given  T System    Vis    Given LIVE  F System    Vis    Given where LIVE   x x  LIVE  LIVE is the most nondeterministic process that is deadlock free The rst property states that no wrong random non-associated tuple gets stored in EHR and the second property states that the nurse can eventually take steps and will not get deadlocked We have sketched proofs for the above results based on their semantics using traces of events Due to the large number of cases to be considered we feel that such a proof is easily subject to accidental omissions and hence is best checked by automated assistant To this end we have encoded the CSP processes described in this paper two such tools The rst system we used was the fully automated CSP failures-reìned prover FDR2 Failures-Divergence Reìnement Our e xperience with this system is limited but a straightforward encoding led the system to run for hours probably indicating divergence The second system we used was the extension CSP-prover to the interacti v e theorem pro v e r Isabelle In this system there is a restricted type system for communications and the encoding entailed creating a number of functions for coercing data into this type system Also certain operators were lacking Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


index interleaving in particular and so we had to expand the code to accommodate this lack As of this writing the proofs in CSP-prover of the above two results are incomplete We conclude from this effort that there are interesting challenges to automating proofs of AIDC workîows such as the ones for the mediator To summarize these results in less technical language there are three possibilities for the outcome of operator actions First there are actions that make progress by providing proper updates of the EHR This will occur when the nurse adheres to the speciìed workîow Second there are actions that lie within the protection envelope but do not make progress For example repeated reading of a patientês tag is tolerated by the system although it is not the speciìed workîow A detected error occurs when reading tags on two devices rather than on a patient and a device Third there are actions that corrupt the EHR database These require signiìcant deviation from speciìed workîow such as reading the tag on one patient and then collecting a reading from a different patient 7 Related Work We are not aware of any prior work on formal modeling and analysis of ADIC workîows in health care but formal techniques have been applied to workîows in general there have been case studies in heath care applications and there is a signiìcant body of non-formal work on AIDC in health care Yong et al in use CSP to model and reìne workîows to prove correctness properties Puhlmann et al  use the  calculus to model workîow patterns Stafansen sho ws ho w the Calculus of Communicating Systems CCS can be used to model workîow Davulcu et al  use Concurrent T ransaction Logic CTR to specify analyze and schedule workîows Van der Alast et al  use Petri nets to model w orkîo w  Petri nets are able to model Yet Another Workîow Language\(YAWL which in turn can model a wide range of workîow patterns Barkaoui et al  use Petri nets to model v erify and improve an operating room workîow Song et al 22 provide a classiìcation of computer-aided health care workîows and workîow application issues Van der Alast et al  describes a method for nding w orkîo ws as Petri nets automatically from hospital process logs Ardissono et al  present a frame w ork for the management of context-aware workîow systems They use the framework to develop a prototype application handling medical guidelines specifying workîow for monitoring patients treated with blood thinners In our research on AIDC we attempted to use  calculus and Finite State Machines FSMs before concluding that CSP was better-suited to our needs because of its algebraic notation simple treatment of communication and its representation for internal and external choice However it is likely other models discussed above could provide good formalisms for reasoning about AIDC AIDC techniques are now being used in many different areas in the health care sector One notable area is the use of AIDC techniques for the blood management to reduce blood handling errors so that the chances of bad blood transfusions is reduced Clarke et al 7 model and verify an in-patient blood transfusion process Al Nahas et al  o v ervie w research in v arious applications of RFID-based AIDC systems in hospitals Automated identiìcation of patients pro vides more accurate and efìcient association of patients with their medical readings and the medical procedures they should undergo AIDC techniques are being deployed to provide error-free and fully-audited drug management in hospitals 4 Hospital-wide AIDC 9 10 is being investigated for tracking patients assets and staff 8 Conclusion We have introduced a methodology for modeling and analyzing AIDC workîows to provide high assurance protection envelopes Such techniques will aid the development of computer and networking systems that support AIDC in safety-critical workîows like those used in hospitals To illustrate and demonstrate the value of our approach we have designed and implemented a medical mediator system which provides RFID identiìcation using a mobile device that links to medical devices to collect patient readings and enters them automatically in the EHR of the correct patient within wellspeciìed and veriìed conditions This is the rst work on formal analysis of AIDC workîows it contributes insight into good primitives for clear speciìcations in this area and promises wide applicability Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by NSF CNS 07-16626 NSF CNS 07-16421 NSF CNS 05-24695 ONR N00014-08-1-0248 NSF CNS 05-24516 DHS 2006-CS-001-000001 and grants from the MacAruthur Foundation and Boeing Corporation Anh Nguyen was supported by a fellowship from the Vietnam Education Foundation The views expressed are those of the authors only References  FDR2\(F ailures-Di v e r gence Reìnement internet website http://www.fsel.com  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10

  12 the PL is intended to fulfill, thus many requirements and specifications that would be found in a PL design specification would need to be provided by the specific PL procurement agency. The ORS Phase III standards can be downloaded from http://projects.nrl.navy.mil/busstandards  Communications Interfaces  A key external interface for th e space segment \(bus and PL is RF communications to the ground. This topic investigated standardization for SC command and control \(C&C communications link and the tactical communication link Figure 11 presents a basic high-level view of the RF communications pathways envisioned in the standards Other issues investigated related to both current and future approaches the military is planning for RF communications including, data flow, frequency band definitions modulation techniques, data rates, communication security COMSEC\and basic defi nition of ground interface locations. Given the current maturity of the general military SC C&C network, the presen t SGLS architecture and the expected Unified S-Band \(USB\architecture were established as the standard. Fo r the tactical links, standard UHF was established for LDR application, and the Common Data Link \(CDL\ocol was established as the HDR standard Ground Support Checkout Interface In support of the rapid call-up scenario, standards for interfacing spacecraft bus and the payload, and processing the integrated space vehicle though launch, is one of the unique activities under the IS ET derived ORS system design. The need to develop an approach for this effort in sufficient detail in order to derive requirements that would influence the spacecraft bus design is critical. The approaches developed have design and manufacturing ramification on the bus, such as the ability to install batteries late in the flow, rapid \223built-in-test\224 capabilities periodic checks, and access a nd safety implications Data Interfaces: Bus to Payload and Ground This document defines the data exchange protocols, data transport formats, packet definitions and field definitions for the bus/PL interface. Underlying electrical interface for the bus/PL interface is the HDLC and SpaceWire. The bus/PL interface is defined such that the HDLC interface SpaceWire interface, or both can be used. The bus design will provide support for both interfaces. The PL may choose to implement either one or both. The bus/PL interface is defined to dynamically suppor t either or both interfaces without needing bus reconfiguration \(i.e., FSW changes This document also defines the data exchange protocols data transport and packet template for the space/ground interface. The space to ground interface definition assumes the use of a flight side SGLS transponder integrated with COMSEC slices. The SGLS forward link assumes a flightside Cardholder COMSEC slice. The SGLS return link  Figure 11 Radio Frequency Communications Architecture  


  13 assumes that the SGLS transponder supports both the narrow-band and wide-band inte rfaces. While a return link COMSEC is required, this document assumes that the return link COMSEC does not levy any blocking or packaging constraints for the return link This interface standard was developed as part of the ORS Phase 3 Bus effort. This interface standard was adopted by the ORS Phase 3 Bus and COMMx payload elements. As a result, the TACSAT-4 spacecraft implemented the encl osed interface standards for its bus to payload and space to ground interfaces This document is limited to and currently defines the interfaces between the spacecraf t bus and the payload, and between the spacecraft bus and the ground. Subsequent releases will define the add itional internal interfaces. The depth of detail required for in terface standardization and the need for coverage of additional interfaces is an ongoing assessment effort by ORS s upported standards definition efforts. The intent is to levy interface standards where these standards will lead to efficien t system integration, robust operational capabilities, and improved system flexibility while reducing overall system cost 4  C ONCLUSION  Both the STP-SIV and the ORS ISET efforts have developed standards that provide options for cost-effective capable, flexible spaceflight. Pathfinder SC buses are currently in development for both efforts and will have flight heritage within approximately one year Through the efforts of ISET and the associate prototype teams, the ORS program ha s successfully produced an extensive and well-documented set of ORS bus standards consistent with the ORS concept of operations \(CONOPS and classes of missions. The process used to produce these standards has resulted in technically sound standards which are understood, with buy in from industry. Business factors were also strongly considered to improve the transition of these standards into successful acquisition under a subsequent operational phase While ORS must provide the business foundation, these technical standards are intended to be more broadly useful in order to further volume production, standards acceptance, and the industry business cases. The ORS standards are readily available to Government organizations and payload developers SDTW employs lessons learned from decades of space flight to standardization of STP-SIV design. Flexibility is planned from the beginning and missions are adapted within the range of the SC\222s capability. Development of SC standards requires upfront investment in order to achieve a return on investment once multiple missions have been built and flown. The more PL provi ders who are willing to adopt the STP-SIV interfaces and deve lop experiments applicable to the capabilities of the SC the more successful this program will become R EFERENCES   National Research Council The Role of Small Satellites in NASA and NOAA Earth Observation Programs National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 2000  G F Squibb, \223Meeting the Needs of the Space Technology Industry,\224 ISO Focus, Oct 2005   T.

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.
