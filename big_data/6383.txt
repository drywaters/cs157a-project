Mining context-aware preferences on relational and sensor data 003 Davide Beretta Politecnico di Milano  Italy davide.beretta@mail.polimi.it Elisa Quintarelli Politecnico di Milano  Italy quintare@elet.polimi.it Emanuele Rabosio Politecnico di Milano  Italy rabosio@elet.polimi.it Abstract The increasing amount of available digital data motivates the development of techniques for the management of the information overload which risks to actually reduce people's knowledge instead of increasing it Research is concentrating on topics related to the problem of 002ltering/suggesting a subset of available information that is 
likely to be of interest to the user besides this subset may vary and is often determined by the context the user is currently in We cannot actually expect only a collaborative approach where users manually specify the long list of preferences that might be applied to all available data that is why in this paper we propose a preliminary methodology described by using a realistic running example that tries to combine the following research topics context-awareness data mining and preferences In particular data mining is used to infer contextual preferences from the previous user's querying activity on static data and on available dynamic values coming from sensors 1 Introduction 
Distinguishing useful data from all the information overload which is irrelevant to the speci\002c application/user is not a trivial task since the same piece of information can be perceived differently even by the same user in different situations or places i.e in a different context  In the recent literature context-models see 3 for a survey have been introduced with the purpose of personalizing repositories on the basis of some perspectives such as the user's role and location his/her interests and situations he/she is involved in temporal information However data 002ltering based only on context is a coarse-grain solution to the problem since it does not consider personal preferences 
To overcome this limitation several approaches 11 have been proposed for personalizing relational data on the 003 This research is partially supported by the European Commission Programme IDEAS-ERC Project 227977-SMScom basis of contextual preferences de\002ned by the user However users may be discouraged w.r.t the activity of explicitly indicating their preferences in all the possible contexts because of the required amount of work A way around this problem is exploiting some implicit information provided by the users querying activities Given these motivations in this paper we informally describe a methodology which uses data mining algorithms for inferring contextual preferences on tuples of relational 
databases containing both static data and dynamic data coming from sensors When considering data transmitted from sensors the problem of inferring preferences is much more dif\002cult due to their intrinsic dynamic nature As a running example used throughout the paper we consider the situations of students and professors roaming the campuses of a big University e.g Politecnico di Milano that desire to achieve their goals of optimizing their schedules 002nding classrooms for lessons or quiet classrooms for studying setting up card games or socializing and meeting friends during the lunch These different needs are in\003uenced both by the current context e.g the student is studying or he/she has a free interval of time and by his/her personal preferences which can derive also by 
data coming from sensors such as the classroom occupation or temperature All the applications composing the information system related to our scenario rely on a central relational database which contains both static and dynamic data We suppose that data arriving from sensors are about temperature noise and the number of people in a room and are stored in temporal relations keeping trace of the information about the transaction time interval of a tuple which is system-generated and represents the interval when that tuple is current in the database and may be retrieved The relational schema used for the running example is CAMPUS campus id 
 address city  BUILDING building id  campus id genre year director CLASSROOM room id  number seats building id type RESTAURANT r id  name address city phone type  
SENSOR CLASSROOMS room id  temp noise occupation timeinterval SENSOR RESTAURANTS rest id  temp noise occupation timeinterval The paper is organized as follows Sect 2 presents the state of the art and Sect 3 some preliminary notions Sect

4 describes the mining framework while Sect 5 the steps of our methodology Sect 6 draws the conclusions 2 Related Work Personalization techniques in context-aware frameworks have been proposed in the database literature Approaches relying on the manual speci\002cation of contextual preferences are 1 11 13 The problem of learning preferences from log data without requiring users effort has been recognized as important in many applications In a mining methodology to discover partial orders among tuples is de\002ned relying on the central idea that the more frequently an item appears in the log the more preferable the item is computes numerical scores for item features on the basis of the frequency of the features both in the log and in the dataset accessed by the user These techniques do not take context into account Contextual preference mining has been addressed in some works borro ws ideas from both 8 and 10 and adds the possibility of detecting context-based preferences by partitioning log data according to the context In cooccurrences in the log between contexts and graphical components are mined to personalize their visualization Such methodologies do not consider the possibility of having part of the data dynamically coming from sensors Sensor data come from data streams that have some intrinsic limitations like the necessity of reducing the amount of data to store making the traditional mining techniques inapplicable Approaches for the frequent itemset extraction problem have been proposed introduces a method to determine frequent itemsets of a maximum prede\002ned length with a unique scan using a vector to keep the support values suggests an algorithm based on the use of a so-called large window divided into smaller slides frequent itemset mining is performed on each slide and the results are incrementally aggregated Finally approximates the support of the frequent itemsets on the whole data stream through probabilistic considerations on the most recent observations In all the cited approaches the mining is executed exclusively on the stream thus allowing to discover correlations only within the elements of the stream itself On the contrary the aim of our work is to propose a methodology to 002nd correlations between contexts and both dynamic data coming from a stream and static ones 3 Background and Notation In this section we introduce some preliminary concepts related to the context model and the association rule mining The CDT context model A key notion in the extraction of context-aware preferences is the representation of context and of its components in order to be able to de\002ne a relationship between each context and the aspects of interest such as relevant information pertinent preferences of the application scenario In this work we use a hierarchical context model called Context Dimension Tree CDT formally de\002ned in used to specify at design-time all the possible contexts the user will be acting in The CDT of a target scenario Fig 1 shows the CDT of our running example is a tree-based structure consisting of i context dimensions black nodes ii the allowed concept values white nodes iii parameters rectangular nodes Dimensions represent the different perspectives through which the information of the application domain can be tailored concepts and parameters are the actualized values based on which the context-aware information is to be selected Parameters are used when the designer does not want to list all the possible values for a given dimension e.g see the location dimension Each context is then de\002ned as a combination of context element s that is dimension-value pairs The adoption of a hierarchical organization allows us to employ different abstraction levels to specify and represent contexts see the subtree rooted in the professor node Here a possible context is the one of a student who is interested in 002nding information about classrooms when she/he is alone formally expressed as C 1 021  user  student    interest topic  classrooms    situation  alone   Figure 1 The CDT of our running example Once the CDT has been de\002ned a methodology for context-based view tailoring of fers to the designer a 003e xible approach to the selection of the relevant portion of a database to be presented to the user  called contextual view  associated with each context Association Rules Association rules  describe the cooccurrence of data items in a large amount of collected data and are represented as implications in the form X  Y  where X and Y are two arbitrary sets of data items such that X  Y    The quality of an association rule is usually measured by means of support and con\002dence Support corresponds to the frequency of the set X  Y in the dataset while con\002dence corresponds to the conditional probability

of 002nding Y having found X  and is given by sup  X  Y  sup  X   4 The Framework Our proposal is integrated in the wider framework for contextual view tailoring and personalization The user's device runs the client application accessing a local portion of the database i.e the personalized contextual view  that represents the portion of data relevant for the user current context The personalized contextual views are computed and loaded on the user's device during the synchronization phase however we suppose that the dynamic data coming from sensors are updated more frequently When the device connects to the application server it transmits the current context and the user id First on the basis of the current context the server selects the contextual view  this step is based on an association between the different contexts and the relevant portions of the database that is performed by the designer at design-time Then i n the second step the server personalizes the selected contextual view according to the list of preferences of the user that are stored on the server In order to enable the preference mining activity the device performs a logging of the data instances accessed by the user and the generated log is used by the system to periodically infer new preferences on the basis of the recorded activities 5 Contextual Preferences The preference model de\002ned in e xpresses conte xtual preferences on tuples for ranking the information that is of interest for a user in his/her current context Every preference is quantitative thus is associated with a numerical score in the interval 0    where 1 represents the highest interest and 0 states indifference Let R  X  indicate the schema of a relation R with its set of attributes X  A 033 preference on a relation R  X  is a pair h SQ score i  where the selection rule SQ is a query expressed as 033 cond i R  n 033 cond i 1 T 1  n 033 cond in T n   and score is a real number in 0    Each 033 cond ij is a conjunction    of atomic conditions A\022c  where 022 is a comparison operator and c a constant compatible with the domain of A  A 033 preference indicating an interest in computerized classes is h 033 type=ìcomputerized CLASSROOM  0  8 i  De\002nition 1 A contextual preference is a pair h C p i  where C is a context and p is a 033 preference For example the contextual preference h C 1  h SQ 0  8 ii  with C 1 speci\002ed above and SQ  033 type computerized  occupation 0  50 CLASSROOMS n SENSOR CLASSROOMS means that very often students interested in classrooms when they are alone prefer uncrowded computerized classrooms We refer to preference components with a dot notation e.g p 033 SQ is the selection rule of the 033 preference p 033  Now we describe the main phases for mining 033 preferences without entering into the details of each step additional phases can be considered for optimizing the inference of preferences Phase 1 log synchronization The 002rst step of the preference mining procedure is the synchronization of the logs between the user's device and the server in particular the log stored on the device during a temporal window describing the user querying activity between the previous synchronization and the current one is transmitted to the server where it is integrated into the entire server log Given a database DB  we indicate with TDB its temporal portion used for storing data coming from sensors and the set of non temporal relations with DB n TDB  The server log is composed by a set of tables one for each relation schema present in the database schema DB n TDB  The log table associated with R  X  2 DB n TDB  indicated by LOG R  contains a column for each attribute of the relations belonging either to R  X  or to relations reachable from R  X  by following the foreign key constraints Such a set of relations is denoted as  Join  R  X   This extension of the schema of R  X  is applied to mine richer association rules i.e correlations that consider also values present in other relations different from R  X   that contribute to describing the tuples of R  X   including the data coming from sensors When generating 033 preferences in order to correlate the context with the data instances each log table contains also one column for every contextual dimension together these attributes record the context in which the user has accessed the associated tuple Finally each row also indicates the timestamp The device log is used to collect information about the user activity in the period between two different synchronizations with the server Due to the limited resources of the device the device log records a list of pairs composed by a SQL query q i and the instant t i when the user applied q i  To integrate such a log in the server log the server has to re-execute for each listed pair h q i  t i i  a modi\002ed version of the query q i  on a copy of the contextual view loaded on the device in the following way each query is executed to update the log table of each relation R  X  contained in the from clause of the query Moreover for each relation R  X   the query is modi\002ed in order to correctly 002ll data in the server log by adding joins in  Join  R  X  and by removing the projections in the select clause In order to correctly 002ll the data coming from sensors in  Join  R  X  the values that are current at the query instant t i are used Example 1 Server log for 033 preferences Let us consider the reduced versions of the relations CLASSROOM and SENSOR CLASSROOMS represented in Fig 2 Suppose

c.room id=s.room id WHERE c.type=`computerized  Fig 3 shows in italics the tuples appended to the log associated with CLASSROOM  initially not empty as a consequence of the above query For the sake of space only interesting columns are reported Phase 2 mining 033 rules The mining algorithm is applied to the server log and extracts 033 rules de\002ned as follows De\002nition 2 A 033 rule 026 r 033 on the relation R  X  is a tuple h C  cond sup conf i  where C is a context cond a conjunction of conditions of the form A  value  with A 2 X i for some R i  X i  2  Join  R  X   sup and conf are the support and the con\002dence of the association rule C  cond  A 033 rule for the CLASSROOM relation is h user student  situation alone  classroom.type=`computerized  0.2 0.8 i Throughout the paper we denote by 026 r 033 a generic 033 rule and refer its components by means of the dot notation Phase 3 score computation Once 033 rules have been computed they must be assigned a score in the interval 0  to transform each 033 rule 026 r 033 h C  cond sup conf i into a 033 preference p 033 such that p 033 C  C and p 033 SQ  cond  In the authors underline that the score of a prefer ence on some values should depend on the frequencies of those values in both the log and the data set accessed by the user In this work we chose as preference indicator for a 033 rule 026 r 033 001 026 r 033  026 r 033 conf 000 f 026 r 033  where f 026 r 033 represents the frequency of the data satisfying 026 r 033 cond in the contextual view accessed by the user If 001 026 r 033  0 the user has accessed the data related to the consequent of the rule more than what would have happened with random queries thus showing a preference for such data Once the preference measure has been chosen we must de\002ne a non-decreasing function of 001 026 r 033 for computing the score of the new preference p 033  when 001 026 r 033  0  A possible formula is the following p 033 score  min 015 001 001 026 r 033  1 if 001 026 r 033  0 1 In Eq 1 the parameter 015 somehow ampli\002es the value of 001 026 r 033 in order to reach a preference score equal to 1 in the cases of high interest the formula assigns the maximum score to all the 033 rules having 001 026 r 033 025 1 015  Note that different non-linear formulae can also be considered The preference score comes from a comparison between the con\002dence of a 033 rule and the frequency of the items in the 033 rule among data Let us 002rst consider the problem excluding the information coming from sensors We must compute the frequency on the data set that the user has accessed that is the personalized contextual view However accesses in several contexts may contribute to the extraction of a certain 033 rule For example consider the rule situation=alone  classroom.type computerized  which can be mined from the tuples of the server log related to queries performed both in the context  situation=alone  and in  situation=alone  interest topic=classrooms  The mentioned contexts may be associated with different views where the percentage of the computerized classrooms is not the same To solve the problem the frequency associated with a certain rule is computed as a weighed average f 026 r 033  X v 2 V 026 r 033 w 026 r 033 v 001 f 026 r 033 v 2 We have indicated by V 026 r 033 the set of views accessed by the user queries that may have contributed to the extraction of 026 r 033  and by f 026 r 033 v the frequency computed on v  The underlying principle in the determination of the weights w 026 r 033 v considers that the computed frequency has to be equal to the con\002dence of a rule obtained by accessing data randomly Therefore the frequency in the view v gets a weight on the basis of the percentage of log tuples coming from accesses realized on v among the tuples associated with all the views that have contributed to the extraction of the rule Let us now consider sensor data which we suppose are updated at each user query if their source is available The views that contribute to the extraction of a rule 026 r 033 do not distinguish one from the other only for the related context In Fig 4 we show the queries issued by a certain user against different personalized contextual views we also report the query time instants and the instants of the personalized contextual views computation Each query is associated with the view where it is issued divided into a static part S i and a dynamic part D i  the latter contains data coming from sensors Two main aspects are immediately evident from the 002gure 1 the static part of the view related to the common context C 1 is different in the two instants t 1 and t 7  indeed the personalization may depend on dynamic data that may be different at t 1 and t 7  2 The dynamic part of the views 
119 


Figure 4 A sequence of queries may differ for each issued query indeed we are supposing that the values of the dynamic data e.g the occupation of a classroom may be updated at each user request As the example highlights in the worst case the set V 026 r 033 contains a view for each query formulated by the user However in our case study we suppose that updates of the sensor tables are not continuous but triggered by a certain sampling policy e.g a sample every thirty minutes Moreover during the frequency computation it is not necessary to recompute from scratch all the views associated with the queries referring to Fig 4 we may compute the views associated with the instants t 1  t 4 and t 7  and derive the needed ones only by modifying the values of the sensor attributes that can be retrieved by querying the temporal relations Example 2 Score computation Consider the server log in Fig 3 The rule situation=alone  occupation=[0,50 is mined with con\002dence 3 4  with the contribution of the contexts C 1 021 situation=alone and C 2 021 situation=alone  interest topic=classrooms  The log rows related to C 1 are associated with two time instants t 1 and t 3  connected with different views According to the tables in Fig 2 the frequency of the value 0  50 in the view of C 1 at instant t 1 is 3/4 while at instant t 3 is 1/2 Suppose that the frequency in the view related to context C 2 at instant t 2 is 1/3 Applying 2 we obtain f 026 r 033  1 4 001 3 4  1 2 001 1 2  1 4 001 1 3  0  52  Finally choosing 015  2  we can compute the preference score by 1  2 001  3 4 000 0  52  0  46  The inferred preferences will be used to customize the contextual views and their computation requires a periodic aging step not described here 6 Conclusions and Future Work This paper has informally described a methodology exploiting data mining for the automatic extraction of contextual preferences on relational and sensor data The described techniques have been implemented in a Java tool so far managing only standard relational data We have evaluated the approach on a movie-related case study exploiting a real video-on-demand log 002le achieving encouraging results in terms of recall in more detail in our experimental setting our approach gains 8.3 recall w.r.t a naive algorithm based on item popularity reaching 38.8 against 30.5 We have also used our techniques to mine non-contextual preferences 002nding that in our case study context can bring 3.3 recall increase In the future we plan to add to our prototype the ability of managing sensor data too Moreover currently preference mining relies only on the user past querying activity we are now investigating the possibility to combine our proposal with other techniques coming from recommendation systems in order to propose other kinds of suggestion e.g unexpected serendipitous data References  R Agra w al R Rantzau and E T erzi Conte xt-sensiti v e ranking In Proc of SIGMOD  pages 383ñ394 2006  R Agra w

First, data generalization consisting of the movie clustering and the neighborhood aggregation was done. Next, after doing normalization on these data, we used the personal normalized data to mine association rules based on customer preferences, and stored them in the rule base. Finally, rule information aided a preliminary recommendation; afterward, the relevance feedback mechanism improved further recommendations based on the explicit interaction from customers A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by National Science Council of R.O.C under Grant NSC99-2220-E-224-005 R EFERENCES  1  Cane Wing-Ki Leung, Stephen Chi-fai Chan, and Fu-lai Chung  A collaborative filtering framework based on fuzzy association rules and multiple-level similarity   Knowledge and Information Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, pp 357-381, 2006 2  S.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm.

The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
