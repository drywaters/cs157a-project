the assembled-military container failure cases 031 a new method  named as data mining was put forward in this paper. The necessity of data mining method was introduced in failure analysis domain. The basic principle of association rule and the construction of the corresponding data mining system was briefly described Finally the remaining problems of the system were pointed out Key words 014 failure analysis; assembled-military container; data mining; association rule 015U INTRODUCTION With the battlefield environment becoming more and more complex, the reliability of the assembled-military container is strictly required However, with the perfection of its functions, the 
increasing quantities of mission, the strict requirement for the working condition the components structure for the assembled military container is gradually becoming complicated, which is followed by the increasing failure probability of the components of the assembled-military container. Therefore, to make efficient and rapid failure analysis on the failed components and find the resource of failure and its intrinsic reasons, and put forward with improving and preventive measures have great meaning to the normal working and to the improvement on the operation reliability of the assembled-military containers However, because of the complexity of the failure information, the mutual destructive act among the failure components, the diversity of the latent failure factor, the cross of the failure mechanism and the fuzziness of the failure feature recognition, the failure 
analysis has been become an extremely complex branch of science. It is a serious undertaking to surface out the root causes among the various latent factors and take some proper improving measures through comprehensive analysis based on the incomplete and inaccurate data obtained from great amount of observation and test. Therefore, it is quite urgent to develop an efficient and intelligent automatic failure analysis system to fill up the deficiency of subjectivity inactivity and unpredictability caused by the manpower analysis Over the past decade, people kept exploring the failure process information processing and its failure diagnosis, intelligent recognition, knowledge acquisition and expressing methods. A new method 1 introducing the artificial intelligent into the failure analysis of the 
assembled-military containers, is put forward for the diagnosis of failure modal, some of which has achieved good results  But some failure analysis auxiliary experts systems are based on the knowledge rule reasoning, and when applying them in the assembled-military container failure analysis system, it has some defects in inaccurate knowledge acquisition big limitation of knowledge representation, which indicates that the current AI experts systems dont have a very high intelligence. However, if the data mining and knowledge discovery can be introduced to this system, some of the problems would be relieved or be partially solved 015V DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY The development and combination of database management system and AI machine learning brings about a new technology known as knowledge discovery 
in database. It is a cross science covering the fields of machine learning, mode recognition, statistics, AI database, knowledge recognition, data visualization high performance computing and expert system, and its main contents are data selection, data pre-processing data converting, data mining, explanation and knowledge evaluation. Data mining is one of the steps of knowledge discovery, but it is the most important one  The relationship between them can be shown as Fig-1     Fig.1  The process of knowledge discovering Data mining is the process of abstracting unaware previously unknown but potentially useful information and knowledge from plentiful, incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and stochastic data. According to the different task and object of data mining, the knowledge discovered by data 
mining can be concluded as association rule classification and clustering   Since the birth of data mining technology, it gets most of the attention of experts from lots of fields and courses. Every field of industry actively conducts study and application, and up to now, has achieved satisfied theoretical research and data mining products 000\003 015W   FAILURE ANALYSIS OF Data after convertin g mode data Target data Pre-processing data converting

  ASSEMBLED-MILITARY CONTAINER BASED ON THE ASSOCIATION RULE A. The construction of failure case database of assembled-military container Assembled-military container is a vast system with rich components, complicated construction and various failure factors, therefore, the failure information of assembled-military container also possesses a unique feature different from other failure system. Normally the failure information of assembled-military container has a kind of gradation. As to the failure information at the same gradation, it can be further clarified to seek for the most detailed and nature information. Taking failure mode as an example, it can be classified into deformation, fracture, wear, thermal damage, electrical injury, corrosion, pollution and radiation damage Among the above-mentioned failure mode, fracture is the most frequent phenomenon, and can be further clarified, shown as Fig-2         Fig.2  The sorts of failure mode Assembled-military container failure has kind of relevance. In the system, the failure can be transferred among different components. That is to say, the failure of one structural unit can lead to the failure of associated structural unit because of the change of association status. The relevance can also be shown in the failure information. For example, the starting position of the failure can be extrapolated by the propagation path and shape, and the possible failure mode and failure factor can be concluded by the macro and micro features of the fracture. The different failure information has some associated relationship. If the associated relationship can be mined and formed a rule, it can direct efficiently failure analysis According to the above-mentioned features of failure information, the failure case database can be built and the failure information can be classified into components information, material information, material analysis, load information, environment information appearance feature, failure position, crack feature macro and micro features of fracture, analyzing method failure mode, cause, precautions and fracture mechanism, etc. Thus, it can conclude the associated relationship of the failure information making use of the association rule mining, then conclude that the association rule which is beneficial to the failure analysis B. Association rule mining based on the failure case database  The association rule goes in the logical implication like X=x 015z Y=y induced through the data mining based on the assembled-military container failure case database, in which X and Y are the failure information attribute of the failure cases in the database, x and y are the corresponding value of each failure information attribute Support and confidence are two important concepts of association rule. Support can measure the importance of statistics of association rule in the whole data which was set, and confidence measures the reliability of association rule. If s% cases in the failure case database include X=x U Y=y, the support of association rule X=x 015z Y=y is s; if the c% cases with X=x of the failure case database simultaneously contains Y=y, the confidence of association rule X=x 015z Y=y is c Normally speaking, customers are interested in and think valuable the association rule with high support and confidence. Therefore, to mine the association rule is to find the interested association rule with Minimum support and Minimum confidence which can satisfy customers needs in the given database D, namely to fit the inequality Support \(X=x Y=y 0168 Min Support Confidence \(X=x Y=y 0168 Min Confidence The useful knowledge implicated in the failure information can be obtained through data mining the association rule using data mining tool, taking failure case database as training data volume. This knowledge can be applied in the analysis case data to instruct the failure analysis 015X THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FAILURE ANALYSIS DATA MINING SYSTEM OF ASSEMBLED-MILITARY CONTAINER A  Problems needed to be solved Through collecting the mining of the association rules on about 1000 typical failure cases of assembled-military container, the implied association rule is obtained among various failure information, and the customer-interesting and efficient association rule is also found. The realization of the mining the analysis cases decision-making attribute, namely customer provides the system the failure information of cases occurred but without failure analysis, the system should High temperature Fractureenxing Ductile fracture Cleavage fracture Quasi-cleavage Fatigue Strain Mechanical Corrosion Thermal Fretting Intergranular fracture Stress Contact Liquid metal-induced  Stress corrosion Hydrogen embitterment Creep Ductile fracture

  judge the decision-making attributes such as cases failure mode and failure mechanism B  The construction of systems framework In order to realize the function of the system, the assembled-military container failure analysis system should contain the data processing module, data transformation module, data mining module, rule management module and rules data transformation module. The systems workflow is shown in Fig-3                   Fig.3  The flow chart of data mining The function of each module in the system is as follows a. data-processing module This module can realize the function of adding deleting, modifying, integrating the case data, and produce dictionary database and case database b. data transformation module This module can realize the feature selection of attribute entry, that is to say to delete the meaningless attribute entry, and produce new case data table as the original data of data mining, and produce the description of attribute and case data documents which can be recognized by data mining module c. data mining module This module can realize the prediction of association rule mining and decision-making attribute and export all the association rule meeting the requirements of confidence and support d. rule management module Customers may not all be interested in the association rule mined by the data mining tool, so the meaningless and uninstructed rules should be deleted from the rule document to raise its efficiency. This module can achieve more valuable and practical rules through analyzing the associated relationship among different failure information and filtering the rules with more flexible and applicable qualification  e. rule transformation module This module can realize the transformation of rule data, and produce the rule document that can be easily recognized by customer 015Y THE MAIN PROBLEM IN THE SYSTEM A.  Different sorts of data The system applies the relationship database as the training data, therefore, it is quite important whether the relationship database can efficiently conduct the data mining. The data sorts of failure cases of assembled-military container include documents graphics and images, and different data mining tool can only rule-mine the respective data sort, therefore, one data mining system can not deal with all sorts of data So, a specific data mining system should be built on the certain sort of data B  Dynamic data and datas defect Vast amount of training case data provides the wide searching space for data mining, and increases the possibility of valid rules as well. It can not reach satisfied results through taking the different failure informations associated relationship into consideration   Training case data Security data under analysis Data-processing module Automatically inquire the p rediction result Case database Dictionary database Data transformation module Data doc Name doc Data mining module Rule management module Rules data transformation module Rule doc 
347 


  a more efficient qualification that filters the associated rule must be found to make results of the data mining system more effective 015Z CONCLUSION Through analyzing the features of the data of failure cases of assembled-military container, the data mining system builds a relationship database suitable for data mining. And by means of data processing, rule processing, the effectiveness is increased to a certain degree, and can instruct to a certain extent the failure analysis for the assembled-military container R EFERENCES   Li a o T W  Zhan ZH Mount  CR 031 Integration database And Expert system of Failure mode identification 032\027 M 032\031 031 beijing 031 defense press 031 1999:32  Y u anm i ng 031 Zhou Shengqiang 031 Application of database in failure analysis aided expert system 032\027 J 032\031  Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2001\(supp 031 126-129  a ng Bi ngr u 031 Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Discovery 032\027 M 032\031 031 Beijing 031 Metallurgical Industry Press 031 2000:58  Jia w ei Han  Miche line  K a m b er 031 Concept and Technology of Data Mining 032\027 M 032\031 031 Beijing 031 Machine Press 000\003

Further the potential pitfalls as well as challenging issues need to be addressed by an association rule mining technique are also discussed. We believe that the results of this evaluation will help decision maker for making important decisions. We have evaluated the algorithms based on parameters like scalability, quality of filtered rules. Our evaluation shows that interactive postmining process should be efficient and produce user interesting rules  ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank ALMIGHTY GOD whose blessings have bestowed in me the will power and confidence to carry out my work    REFERENCES  1 Clau dia Marinica and Fabrice Guillet, “Knowledge-Based   Interactive Postmining of Association Rules Using Ontologies IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data    Engineering, Vol. 22, No. 6 June 2010   B u r d ick M C a li m l i m  J.

Members endowments Familys endowments Attitude of families to IT Attitude of neighbours to IT Adoption attention Fig.1.Information technology adoption model based on farmers endowments From the results above, age, education, family income family communication cost and job type affect farmers capacity of information technology adoption. Moreover perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude of neighbors to techniques affect farmers intention. Therefore the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9 factors to study farmers endowments impact on information technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based on association rules 1 Association rules are to look for the relationship among different variables in the database, and find out the frequent mode [11 Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains A, i.e. TA Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets of items A and B are called antecedent \(left-hand-side or LHS and consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS respectively Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contains the itemset, i.e BAPS Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  ABP Association rules generation is usually split up into two 


separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

SMS = yes a technique while job=farmer, family communication channels middle, family communication cost = middle and family income =middle. The association rules reflect weak relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However farmers are still afraid of getting fake information b technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and selling production, family income = high and public communication channels = wide. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers job, age and family income. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, this technique costs much c 


while age=young, education=high, family communication cost=middle and family income=high. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
